    "fullText": "The Carolina Panthers may feel like they're about to get a big presence back for their first playoff game in eight years.\n\nHead coach Dave Canales spoke with reporters on Thursday, following the last full practice ahead of this weekend's wild-card round matchup against the Los Angeles Rams. And when talking about the outlook for Pro Bowl right guard Robert Hunt, he delivered a pretty encouraging update.\n\n\"Status is questionable, but he had a great day. He had another fantastic day,\" Canales replied. \"He was out there with his guys. I'm very optimistic about Rob playing—and I can't put anything official out there until, of course, we come up with the final roster and all that stuff. But he looked great.\"\n\nHunt missed the final 15 games of the regular season due to a torn biceps, a setback he sustained in the team's Week 2 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Panthers have fielded a handful of different offensive linemen in Hunt's place at right guard, with Austin Corbett receiving the last four starts at the position.\n\nCanales later confirmed that Hunt would be the starter on Saturday if he's good to go.\n\n\"We're not gonna put him out there part-time,\" he stated. \"And this is it. This is the only game we have. This is it. So he's gotta go, he's fired up to help out his teammates and, obviously, that'll be all official whenever it is.\"\n\nThe Panthers are expected to release their official injury report later today.\n\nFollow @ThePanthersWire on Twitter/X for more Panthers content.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Panthers Wire: Panthers HC Dave Canales 'very optimistic' on G Robert Hunt's status",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDespite trade rumors at the end of the 2025 season, Angel Reese is more likely than not to begin the 2026 WNBA campaign with the Chicago Sky.\n\nHowever, the two-time All-Star made it clear last year that she would not endure another 10-34 season in the Windy City.\n\nAs such, Sky general manager Jeff Pagliocca needs to nail his selection in the first round of the loaded 2026 WNBA Draft, which will be held on April 13.\n\nMORE: WNBA nears unfortunate history amid stalled CBA negotiations\n\nThe Sky are picking fifth, which might put Chicago out of range for UConn sharpshooter Azzi Fudd. Given that the Sky are continuing to build around Reese and Kamilla Cardoso, Lauren Betts and Awa Fam may be viewed as redundant if they fall out of the top four.\n\nUnless the Sky opt to trade the pick for more-immediate help, a new mock draft predicts that Chicago will draft TCU star Olivia Miles to transform their backcourt.\n\nHoopsHype's Eden Laase writes that Miles is \" one of the country’s top floor generals\" who would be an easy fit next to Reese. Backcourt scoring and playmaking were major weaknesses for the 2025 Sky, and Miles would be an immediate fix even as a rookie.\n\nMiles, who transferred to TCU from Notre Dame for her final season of NCAA eligibility, has ripped off four triple-doubles in her past seven games for the 13th-ranked Horned Frogs. She is averaging 19.3 points, 7.8 assists and 7.4 rebounds for TCU, which is one of the top teams in the country with a 15-1 record.\n\nPaige Bueckers teases new moves in scintillating Unrivaled debut that makes her even more unstoppable\n\nLSU falls out of the Top 10 after latest AP Top 25 release\n\nLuka Doncic reacts to Trae Young trade to Atlanta Hawks\n\nJonathan Kuminga trade update from insider is awful news for Warriors",

    "fullText": "Arsenal welcome Liverpool to the Emirates Stadium in a Premier League meeting that carries weight beyond a single evening. This is a fixture shaped by momentum, expectation and the quiet pressure that comes with sustaining belief across a long season. For Arsenal, the aim is continuity. For Liverpool, the task is relevance.\n\nBoth clubs arrive with unbeaten runs worth protecting. Arsenal have responded to early December disappointment with authority, five straight league wins restoring rhythm and confidence. Liverpool, unbeaten in nine across all competitions, have steadied themselves after a turbulent autumn, even if the league table offers an unforgiving reflection of their campaign.\n\nSince the late setback against Aston Villa, Arsenal have rediscovered control. Performances have been sharp rather than spectacular, efficient rather than expansive. That consistency has lifted them back into contention and reinforced the sense that Mikel Arteta’s project continues to edge closer to tangible reward.\n\nProgress to the Carabao Cup semi-final has added to that optimism. Supporters sense an opportunity not simply to win matches but to shape a season. Hosting Liverpool at this point of the campaign feels significant. Victory would represent a sixth consecutive league win and another statement that Arsenal are prepared to shoulder expectation rather than shy away from it.\n\nThe Emirates Stadium has increasingly become a place of assurance. Arsenal’s ability to dictate tempo at home has been central to their recent run, and tonight’s contest offers a chance to underline that authority against familiar opposition.\n\nLiverpool’s story has been more complex. Their nine-game unbeaten sequence speaks of resilience, yet dropped points have left them 14 points adrift of the league leaders. Draws against Fulham, Leeds twice and Sunderland have dulled momentum, even as wins in the capital during this run hint at lingering threat.\n\nArne Slot’s side have not enjoyed a smooth defence of their Premier League title. Injuries, adaptation and inconsistency have shaped a season that has demanded patience. A win over Arsenal would not rewrite the campaign, but it could sharpen its conclusion, offering belief that Liverpool still have influence to exert.\n\nIn the UK, Arsenal vs Liverpool will be shown live on Sky Sports. Coverage begins at 7pm GMT on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League, with kick off scheduled for 8pm.\n\nNeed a VPN to watch the match? Our preferred VPN to watch UK TV from anywhere is LibertyShield.com – they offer a 48 hour no-obligation free trial and have apps or all popular devices including Mac, Windows, FireTV, iPhone/iPad and Android.\n\nThis meeting may not settle the Premier League race, but it will shape how the second half of the season feels for both clubs. For Arsenal, affirmation. For Liverpool, opportunity.",

    "title": "There is a lot to digest with no games to play for the Colts.",
    "description": "It’s going to be a while before we see any changes.",
    "fullText": "I’ll start by saying that it is probably healthier to just forget about last season and move on to how to win next year, but like many of you, I have to view the start of next season in a way that reminds me a lot of last season. The decision to remain status quo with our leadership, makes it difficult to see next year being different. I do not recall other organizations allowing such a long learning curve for the GM and Head Coach.\n\nI, like most of you, went into Sunday evening thinking that the possibility existed of seeing the Colts make some changes in the GM and/or head coach. The sentiment was creeping in that they would be retained, but I didn’t hear any reasoning that I bought into (so that’s on me), and given the Colts have been good at keeping their business in house, I felt the odds might still be about 50-50. My personal choice was that they let both the GM and HC go. I felt that their “must win” opportunity was this past year and it had eluded them.\n\nI’m more out on Steichen, based mainly on him appearing to be more involved in X’s and O’s, than getting 53 guys working together to win games. I simply do not think he can run the offense and the team at the same time. I’m out on Ballard because I wouldn’t want him finding my next coach, or any coach for that matter. I blame them both for the “Rivers Experiment”. Not because I believe it failed, but because they did not understand that team building needs to be a constant phenomenon that is not abandoned when the going gets tough.\n\nSteichen should have been a focusing on getting Leonard ready, the minute AR was injured. RL should have been taking first team reps as soon as Jones was injured and the HC should have been selling the team at each stop that Riley would be the man when needed and that they would rally around him, when and if he was called upon. Ballard should have had a QB that he had at least some level of confidence could be a backup on game day. If you had no thought that Rypien could fill that role, find someone else.\n\nRiley Leonard had a pretty nice day for a season finale. I’m only counting the first half, since he saw the 2nd string in the 2nd half. He did score 17 in that half, against a team that only gives up 16 a game. This might make some fans say that you’ve seen enough out of him to make him the starter or backup for next season. I’d like a little more info and I feel we got robbed of this by bringing in Rivers. A four game sample size might have exposed whether he was the guy making downfield connections, or the guy who threw a bad INT and fumbled. On the rushing touchdown he scored, he held the ball like a loaf of bread and a better hit might have seen him loose control. Even if him playing the four games didn’t reveal anything, it would have been four games against four stout defenses to put in his bag and four games of film to work on over the offseason.\n\nFull disclosure, I was against bringing in Rivers the first time. I have a long memory when a player taunts a crowd as he exits a playoff game in our home stadium. Especially, when he didn’t play. By the way, when you are doing an interview, where a Colts hat. Yep, I’m old.\n\nPart 2 here is an admission. I shared that I thought if Steichen was fired, I would just leave Cooter in place and have him call plays. After watching RL on the sidelines this week, I have to ask just what JBC contributes? SS obviously calls the plays. They showed Jones wearing a head set, sitting with the coaches upstairs and Turner sitting with RL on the sidelines, but what the heck was JBC doing? I saw him walk into the picture once and he was clapping. I may be wrong, but I’m not even sure he was wearing a headset? To see him calling plays is a suggestion that I’m glad no one paid attention to.\n\nIn that same scenario, I had Lou moving into the HC role. I guess I am not completely nuts, since he has been requested for an interview with two teams. It is possible that it is still a bad idea and that the teams inquiring are not looking in the right place for their next guy. I am hoping there is a bit more of a shakeup on the defensive side, aside from seeing Partridge leave. Health was a problem, but so was generating a real and visible pass rush, along with getting a LB where they need to be in coverage. It was likely more personnel than scheme.\n\nWe obviously need to make some changes and so far they haven’t come to the administration level. This likely means that unless someone sees Lou as the answer to their problems, all of our changes will involve players and we will not hear much about the roster until March 3rd, when we may have a sense of whether or not it takes the franchise tag to bring D. Jones back. Shortly afterwards, March 9 – 11, we get the legal tampering with free agents. These are not secrets, so you know if you have acquired or lost players, rather quickly.\n\nThere is the combine sprinkled in there, but hopefully the scouting department is looking less at RAS, than guys who are good at football. Without a 1st round pick, it is going make our mock drafts a lot less fun. We honestly have very little to look forward to for the rest of January and all of February. This may see us ranting about last year, longer than we want to. I know I just did.\n\nSo, I’ve laid my blame at the feet of the GM and the HC. Do you have a different villain, or maybe the same villains for a different reason? Feel free vent, so that you can put 2025 in the rear view mirror.",

    "description": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.\n\nThe NFL has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court as to the question of whether the civil action filed in February 2022 by former Dolphins coach (and current Vikings defensive coordinator) Brian Flores against the NFL, the Dolphins, the Giants, the Broncos, and the Texans will be resolved in court, or in arbitration.\n\nThe specific legal question presented to the Supreme Court is this: \"Whether an arbitration agreement governing disputes in a professional sports league is categorically unenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act because it designates the league commissioner as the default arbitrator and permits the commissioner to develop arbitral procedures.\"\n\nThe NFL has wisely narrowed the question, given that the reasoning (if applied throughout corporate America) would empower other companies to attempt to rig the in-house arbitration process by putting employment disputes in the hands of the CEO. Still, the league's position is clear — it wants the Commissioner to retain power over disputes involving the NFL and the various teams that have hired and that handsomely compensate the Commissioner.\n\nThe 25-page document is the first step in an effort to persuade the Supreme Court to take up the case. Of the many petitions it receives each year, few are accepted.\n\nMore time will pass as the Supreme Court considers whether to take the case. Even more time will pass if the Supreme Court grants the petition.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit invalidated the NFL's arbitration provision, concluding that the procedure lacks independence. (And it does.) The Supreme Court, if it takes the case, will decide once and for all whether it's legitimate for the NFL (and any sports league) to put its Commissioner in charge of claims made against the NFL.\n\nIt's fundamentally unfair to delegate those powers to someone whose connection to one side of a legal fight is so obvious. Frankly, no Commissioner should want to be expected to set aside their clear self-interests in an effort to dispense justice in an objective way.\n\nBut this has been the league's practice, for years. It desperately wants to run its own business. It desperately hopes to hold the gavel when it comes to deciding whether the legal claims against it are valid.\n\nIt's a bad way to do business. It's now for the Supreme Court to decide whether it's a good way, or a bad way, to apply the laws of the United States.",

Less than a month after announcing his intent to transfer, Lagway reportedly committed to Baylor, according to Rivals.com.\n\nLagway's decision comes a day after he visited the school and was spotted attending a Baylor basketball game with Bears football coach Dave Aranda.\n\nBREAKING: Florida transfer QB DJ Lagway has committed to Baylor, @Hayesfawcett3 reports🐻https://t.co/WDcp436N9Y pic.twitter.com/GeiyboBmFg\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 8, 2026\n\nLagway, considered the top quarterback in the 2024 class, turned in a strong freshman season with the Gators. After starting the year on the bench, Lagway was pushed into the starting lineup following an injury to Graham Mertz.\n\nLagway threw for 456 yards and three scores in his first start, and then led Florida to a 6-1 record down the stretch, taking down multiple ranked opponents before beating Tulane in a bowl game.\n\nThat strong finish led to heightened expectations for both Lagway and Florida entering the 2025 season. Florida opened the year ranked No. 15 in the AP poll, and then rose to No. 13 after taking down LIU to kick off the season. But a loss to South Florida the following week dropped Florida out of the top-25.\n\nThat proved to be a harbinger of what was to come. Florida finished the year 4-8 and failed to jump back into the top-25 the rest of the way.\n\nLagway played a significant role in the team's demise. After being limited by shoulder issues last offseason, Lagway didn't play up to expectations as a sophomore, finishing the year with just 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 12 games.",

    "fullText": "Cleveland Browns linebacker Devin Bush has been named the AFC Defensive Player of the Week for the final week of the 2025 regular season, the team announced Wednesday.\n\nThe honor caps a resurgent campaign for the veteran linebacker, who delivered his finest performance of the year this past Sunday.\n\nIn the Week 18 finale against the Cincinnati Bengals, Bush was enforcer. He led the defense with 14 total tackles, consistently disrupting the Bengals' offensive rhythm. His defining moment came in the final minute of the first quarter.\n\nDEVIN BUSH 97-YARD PICK-6 FOR THE BROWNS!\n\nCLEvsCIN on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/TuiEnrZajf\n\nWith Joe Burrow driving deep into Cleveland territory, Bush intercepted a pass and sprinted 97 yards for a touchdown. The pick-six not only put the Browns on the scoreboard but also shifted the game’s momentum, serving as the catalyst for the team's fifth win.\n\nThe award serves as a fitting conclusion to a career year for Bush. He finished the 2025 season with personal bests across the board, tallying 125 total tackles, 63 of which were solo stops. He also displayed remarkable versatility as a playmaker, recording three interceptions, eight pass deflections, two forced fumbles, two sacks, and two defensive touchdowns.\n\nHis ability to impact the game in coverage, against the run, and as a blitzer has made him an indispensable cog in the Browns' defensive machine.\n\nAs the team transitions to the offseason, Bush’s future in Cleveland remains a key storyline.\n\nHis contract is set to expire, making him one of the more intriguing names in the upcoming free agency pool. According to Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com, Bush has expressed a desire to return to the Browns.\n\nHowever, retaining him will come at a price. Spotrac.com currently places Bush’s estimated market value at an $8.9 million yearly average.\n\nWhether the Browns can structure a deal to keep him in Cleveland remains to be seen, but for now, Bush stands recognized as one of the AFC's premier defenders to close out the 2025 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns LB Devin Bush wins AFC Defensive Player of the Week",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are making the trip to face the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThis matchup between the 49ers and Eagles is bound to be a good one, and there's already an interesting storyline developing.\n\nAs Zach Berman of The Athletic shared, Eagles lineman Jordan Mailata took a subtle jab at 49ers defensive lineman Bryce Huff. While not a direct jab, it's one that can be taken a certain way based on how Huff's 2024 season went with the Eagles.\n\n\"100 percent,\" Mailata said when asked if Huff would be juiced for this matchup. \"Can't wait to see Super Bowl-champ Bryce Huff.\"\n\nMailata's comments might not seem like much of a jab, but there's important context to know: Huff didn't play in the Super Bowl.\n\nHuff was a healthy inactive for the Super Bowl, meaning he didn't contribute to the Eagles beating the Kansas City Chiefs to win their second Super Bowl title in franchise history.\n\nWhile he was on the team and played for part of the 2024 season, Huff was not a big contributor to the Eagles winning the Super Bowl.\n\nHe struggled to generate sacks, wasn't great in the run game, and overall, was a step down from their other options, so much so that he was a healthy inactive for the biggest game of the season.\n\nMore: Shanahan-era trend haunts 49ers again in NFC West loss\n\nMailata referring to him as \"Super Bowl-champ Bryce Huff\" can be taken as a jab at the former Eagles pass rusher.\n\nHe didn't help the Eagles win the Super Bowl, but while technically a Super Bowl champion, this quote from Mailata can be seen as tongue-in-cheek.\n\nAfter the 2024 season with the Eagles, he was traded to the 49ers, and now, Huff will get to face his former team as the Eagles and 49ers face off for the first time in the playoffs since their infamous last meeting.\n\nThis is the first playoff matchup since the Eagles and 49ers NFC Conference Championship in 2023, when Brock Purdy and Josh Johnson both got hurt, and the 49ers had little to no chance of winning.\n\nBrock Purdy Injury update: Latest news on 49ers QB after taking jarring hit vs. Seahawks\n\n49ers playoff picture: Updated NFL scenarios for San Francisco after failing to win NFC West\n\nTatum Bethune injury update: Latest news on 49ers LB's status in Week 18 game\n\nDid Fred Warner confirm he was returning for the playoffs?",

It is a part of life and he will never be forgotten - he will always be part of our Leeds family.  The Leeds boss confirmed that if it is \"risky\" to do so, then he will not play Jayden Bogle at Derby and it will \"more or less be the same group of players as for the last game\" who are available, with Sam Byram a \"little question mark\" because of a back problem.",
    "fullText": "Leeds United boss Daniel Farke has been speaking to the media before Sunday's FA Cup third round tie against Derby County at Pride Park (kick-off 12:00 GMT).\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\nFarke began by paying tribute to club legend Terry Yorath, who has died at the age of 75: \"Very sad news. All our thoughts and prayers are with his family. Very sad news for us, a proper club legend. Always sad to hear this. It is a part of life and he will never be forgotten - he will always be part of our Leeds family. His legacy will live forever.\"\n\nThe Leeds boss confirmed that if it is \"risky\" to do so, then he will not play Jayden Bogle at Derby and it will \"more or less be the same group of players as for the last game\" who are available, with Sam Byram a \"little question mark\" because of a back problem.\n\nDespite a \"tough run\" of four games in 10 days, Farke insisted he is a \"big believer in cup competitions\" and \"loves this traditional cup\". However, despite always wanting to win the FA Cup, he also acknowledged the \"big priority this season is to stay in the Premier League, so we won't risk any players\".\n\nHe added: \"I don't want to come across that it is over-ambition off back of defeat that I want to win a major competition. We know it is not realistic as promoted side, but we have shown, whether it be a quarter-final, semi-final, final, against top sides we are capable to win this. But to get there, you have to make sure you win early rounds and we respect Derby.\"\n\nFarke confirmed that Karl Darlow will start in goal on Sunday, and on Lucas Perri, who has come under criticism for recent mistakes, he said: \"Always like to be open and honest about everything. Of course, last few games Lucas had situations he could have saved and decision-making wasn't great. It is better not to hide this fact and talk nonsense. Important to hold hand up and be self-critical.\"\n\nHe added: \"You can't just take praise, have to take negative aspects too. And if you don't meet expectations then you will get criticised. I'd rather try not to sugar-coat it and be honest about it, instead of hiding behind elephant in the room.\"\n\nWith Joel Piroe and Jack Harrison struggling for game time in recent weeks, Farke explained how highly he rates Piroe for his \"finishing skills\" and this is important for them in games they dominate, but it is \"not failure of Joel\" that they have had to alter their approach recently. He also praised Harrison for being \"professional\" and when an opportunity next comes, he \"has to use it and shine\".\n\nListen to live commentary of Derby County v Leeds United at 12:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Leeds and BBC Radio Derby, plus follow on the BBC Sport website and app",

    "fullText": "Red Sox predicted to sign $150M World Series Champion, Gold Glove winner after Rafael Devers fiasco originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox signed Alex Bregman last offseason, but the deal included opt-outs. After the conclusion of the 2025 season, it became clear that Bregman would hit the free-agent market after just one season in Boston.\n\n“Alex Bregman plans to opt out of his contract with the Boston Red Sox, a source told ESPN on Tuesday night, confirming a New York Post report. The move was expected and doesn't rule out the veteran third baseman returning to Boston, but for now, he will be part of the free agent class for a second straight offseason,” ESPN reported.\n\nThe Red Sox are optimistic about their chances of bringing Bregman back, but the Philadelphia Phillies could also be in the mix.\n\n“If the Phillies were to move Bohm, in my judgment, it would have to be because they think there's a chance of getting a Bregman or they're one of the teams potentially that could look at a Bo Bichette at a spot that's not shortstop,\" MLB insider Jon Morosi said. \"There's different ways they could augment their club, but you would have to have a clear upgrade on Bohm if you're gonna go ahead and make that trade.\"\n\nSports Illustrated’s Will Laws believes the Red Sox will ultimately get the job done and re-sign Bregman.\n\n“Bregman opted out of his contract just one year into his three-year, $120 million deal in Boston. A quad injury cost him about a month-and-a-half in the middle of the year, but he was otherwise productive at the plate after a relatively down 2024 campaign. Bregman’s approach is sound, with minimal swing-and-miss and a good command of the strike zone, and his defense remains at least solid at the hot corner, so it seems likely he’ll get four- or five-year offers from teams this time around. Bregman assumed a leadership role last year with the Red Sox, who appear motivated to sign a star infielder,” Laws wrote.\n\nThe Red Sox would love to have Bregman back, particularly for the experience and leadership he provides. Boston made the playoffs last year and believes it can repeat that success.\n\nBringing Bregman back would also generate excitement around the city. With Spring Training just a month away, expect the Red Sox to move quickly to work out a deal.",

    "fullText": "Juventus have reignited their pursuit of Bernardo Silva as the Portuguese playmaker prepares to enter the final months of his illustrious tenure at Manchester City. According to an exclusive report by Mirko Di Natale for TuttoJuve, the Bianconeri have made fresh contact to express their interest in the 31-year-old, whose contract at the Etihad Stadium is set to expire in June.\n\nNotably, Juventus are positioning themselves as serious contenders in what is expected to be a crowded race for the midfielder’s signature. With Silva available as a free agent in the summer, Cristiano Giuntoli is keen to lay the groundwork early to beat out a host of elite European clubs. Furthermore, this new approach signals a clear intent from the Turin giants to add world-class experience and creative flair to Luciano Spalletti’s midfield.\n\nIndeed, while Manchester City have benefited from Silva’s brilliance for nearly a decade, his impending status as a free agent has made him the crown jewel of the upcoming summer market. Juventus have identified him as a priority target, viewing him as the ideal profile to elevate the squad’s technical level.\n\nConsequently, as the January window progresses, the Bianconeri are expected to maintain constant dialogue with the player’s representatives. While a mid-season move remains highly unlikely, Juventus are determined to secure a pre-contract agreement to ensure Silva lands in Serie A for the 2026/27 campaign.",

    "description": "There are many “right” ways for a legend to ride off into the sunset. NJPW legend Hiroshi Tanahashi just pulled off one of the best imaginable.",
    "fullText": "You can count me among the many, many people in the industry who popped big at the news Matt Cardona has signed a new full-time deal with WWE.\n\nMatt Cardona is literally the blueprint for how any talent should handle their post-WWE or post-major organization career. Matt had a hell of a first run as Zack Ryder in WWE from 2005 to 2020. Although many people believed he never really got his due, he certainly showed he’s a guy who can get himself over no matter how much or little time and opportunity he may have been afforded.\n\nLong-time fans will know Matt was an early adopter of YouTube, using his own channel to tell deeper stories about himself and what wrestling means to him. Matt constantly thought of ways to help himself, even if he was bumping into a glass ceiling at WWE.\n\nHistory kind of forgets that when Matt was part of that massive WWE COVID-era talent cull, he was initially lost in the mix. He had a two-date gig with AEW, Cody Rhodes helped bring him in, and while many expected him to sign there, for whatever reason it was underwhelming and that was it.\n\nMatt was left kicking around until — and Matt will be the first to tell you this — his wife Chelsea Green (another one of the industry’s good people) told him, “You should take every booking. It should feel like you are everywhere, all the time, and could appear in any promotion.”\n\nMatt took that idea and crushed it. He did “anti-Zack Ryder” matches and became the Death Match King in GCW, which Matt is so rightly proud of.\n\nWe brought Matt (and Chelsea) in regularly for TNA. Matt is effortless to work with. A pro’s pro. Easy on travel. Easy and fair to negotiate with. Easy to work with creatively. If you need something from him, it is a, 'Yes, let’s make that happen.'\n\nI am so happy Matt got to do all the things on the indies over the past five years. He said all along his goal was to return to WWE, if he could go back on his own terms.\n\nWell, after the fun appearance as Zack Ryder late last year in the Last Time Is Now Tournament, he’s on \"SmackDown\" full time as Matt Cardona, and it appears WWE is now cool with him continuing his collectibles and merch podcast, which they weren’t under the Vince McMahon regime.\n\nMatt leaves behind a clear roadmap to wrestlers who get canned by WWE or AEW — or, really, anyone who loses their “dream job.” Reinvention is possible if you work hard and take chances on yourself.\n\nNot surprisingly, when I launched my new Maple Leaf Pro promotion two years ago, I couldn’t wait to bring Matt in. He’s just a joy to deal with. Here’s his match vs Thom Latimer from MLP Resurrection.\n\nOn Jan. 4 at Wrestle Kingdom, it was the end of an era. Hiroshi Tanahashi retired that night. There is no overstating what that means to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Nobody carried that company longer or more consistently. He was the guy who showed up when NJPW needed stability and credibility, and he gave them both for years.\n\nLike John Cena in WWE, Tanahashi was the standard. Night in, night out, tour after tour.\n\nWhen people talk about New Japan’s modern identity, it starts with him. You can point to stars that came after, but he was the foundation. Even with Kazuchika Okada leaving. Even with Will Ospreay leaving. The company still exists in a recognizable form because Tanahashi rebuilt it in his image.\n\nWhat Tanahashi understood better than almost anyone is how to evolve without clinging. He went from being the guy, to the star, to the legend, and then into leadership, without forcing himself into spots he no longer needed to prove he could hang in.\n\nHis body has taken a beating over the years, but he still knows exactly how to structure a match and connect with a crowd. The audience trusted him and, in top-drawer pro wrestling, that matters more than anything.\n\nWe talked all year last year about how someone like John Cena or Sting should go out. This was another example of getting it right. Not dragging it out. Not overstaying. Not pretending Father Time does not exist or can’t land a blow. Tanahashi stood in the center, gave everything he had left, and left with dignity. The result — him losing to a returning Okada — was never in doubt, and it should not have been.\n\nWinning or losing, for him, was not the point.\n\nThe important thing is that Wrestle Kingdom ended with Tanahashi getting his flowers, but the show clearly pointed forward. Younger wrestlers were featured. Olympian Aaron Wolf made his debut and was booked perfectly and carefully. The next generation was given space. New Japan honored its past without getting stuck in it, and that is not easy to do. Tanahashi did not just retire. He left behind a structure that can actually continue.\n\nThere are many “right” ways for a legend to ride off into the sunset.\n\nThis was one of the perfect ways.\n\nI am excited to see what Jake Something — now Jake Doyle — can do in AEW. He debuted Wednesday night as part of The Don Callis Family. He has tremendous upside, and I think Tony Khan and the team can really position Jake into something special.\n\nI’ve known Jake a long time, close to 10 years at this point, going back to his early days on the independents. He has tremendous upside. He used to come into the Can-Am Dojo regularly with Hakeem Zane, who later became Rohit Raju in TNA. From very early on, Jake stood out physically and mentally. He was always someone we pegged as having real upside — not a project, but a guy who, if slotted correctly, could become something meaningful.\n\nOne of the clearest memories I have is from the DeAngelo Williams mini-camp we ran to get Williams ready for his match at Slammiversary 2017. That was NFL star DeAngelo teaming with Moose against Eli Drake — who's now LA Knight — and Chris Masters.\n\nIn rehearsals, Jake played the role of Chris Masters, Joe Coleman played Eli Drake, DeAngelo played himself, and I ended up playing Moose. We had four days to get Williams ready for a 20-minute match, and Jake was a key part of that prep — and even then, you could see how reliable and adaptable he was.\n\nPhysically, in 2026, Jake is right in his prime. He is around 6-foot-3, about 270 pounds, and he moves like someone much smaller. He is a legitimate heavyweight in an era where true heavyweights are becoming rare, especially in AEW, which is far deeper at junior heavyweight than super heavyweight.\n\nWe had big plans for Jake when he returned to TNA in 2023, but timing, injuries and circumstances never fully lined up the way we hoped.\n\nAfter my departure, he became one of those guys who was “there” rather than someone being actively built. That happens more often than people realize. This AEW opportunity feels different though, especially with Callis as his mentor. If Jake hits the ground running like I know he can, people are going to see very quickly why we always believed in him.\n\nThe D'Amore Drop is a weekly guest column on Uncrowned written by Scott D’Amore, the Canadian professional wrestling promoter, executive producer, trainer and former wrestler best known for his long-standing role with TNA/IMPACT Wrestling, where he served as head of creative.

    "description": "The Seminoles have a new punter",
    "fullText": "The Florida State Seminoles are welcoming a new punter to Tallahassee. Daniel Hughes, who spent the 2025 season with the New Mexico Lobos, is transferring to FSU.\n\nHughes is 27 years old and is originally from Melbourne, Australia, and stands 6-foot-5, weighing 235 pounds. He has three years of eligibility remaining and owns a 4.0 GPA. He has a respectable social media following as well, and this article sheds some light on his uniqueness.\n\nHughes had quite a year in New Mexico after spending his prior season in JUCO. He put up numbers that weren’t school records only due to lack of total number of punts in New Mexico’s excellent offense. His net average of 43.6 yards per punt (on 37 total punts) would have been good for the second-best mark in Mountain West Conference history in addition to becoming a New Mexico school record.\n\nFrom the press release for his Honorable Mention All-Mountain West team selection:\n\nDaniel Hughes – Honorable Mention (P)\n\nA Ray Guy Award semifinalist, he is averaging 45.9 yards per punt with a net of 43.6 on just 37 punts with 12 inside the 20 and 13 punts of 50 yards or more. He has not shown up in the stats all season because of the lack of punts by UNM, but would be 16th nationally in punting.\n\nNew Mexico is seventh nationally in net punting, and the 43.6-yard average would easily be a school record, and it would be the second-best net punting mark in Mountain West history. He has averaged at least 46.0 yards per punt in seven of the 12 games this season (and it’s really seven of 11 as UNM didn’t punt against Nevada). Opponents are averaging 3.9 per return, and opponents have muffed three of his punts (8.1%).\n\nJunior College: Lettered in football for one season at City College of San Francisco … played in 10 games as a freshman, punting 49 times for a 37.3 yard average … had a long of 62 … pinned his opponents inside the 20 18 times on the season and forced 13 fair catches … had just two touchbacks.\n\nHigh School: Hughes did not play football at Mount Erin … he did play Footy in the Victorian Football League (VFL), playing for the Northern Bullants in 2021 and 2022, seeing action in 15 games.",

    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers closed off media access to practice and are holding Thursday's practice inside Lambeau Field due to the conditions at the team's practice field across the street, according to coach Matt LaFleur.\n\nLaFleur said players were \"concerned about footing\" outdoors at Clarke Hinkle Field, and the Packers want to make sure they get a good practice session in on Thursday before going to Chicago to play the Bears in the playoff rubber match on Saturday.\n\n\"Nothing top secret about it. What we've decided to do is go into Lambeau,\" LaFleur said Thursday. \"A lot of it is just, the grass inside Lambeau is better than that at our practice field. It hasn't been great on our practice field this year. I think a lot of it is due to the weather and the amount of precipitation we've gotten, so it's a little bit softer. Lambeau is in better shape, so we'd rather go there.\"\n\nThursday is the final official practice of the week. The Packers don't have to worry about chewing up the surface inside Lambeau Field because, as the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs, the team will not play another home game this season.\n\n\"It's best to get a quality practice in Lambeau,\" LaFleur said.\n\nThe Packers will play at Soldier Field on Saturday night. LaFleur was more worried about the wind factor in Chicago than the surface of Soldier Field, which has a reputation for being poor, no matter the time of year.\n\n\"I thought it was fine the last time we played down there,\" LaFleur said.\n\nIt's possible Soldier Field will be wet and soft on Saturday night. A mix of rain and snow is expected Saturday in Chicago.\n\nPractice report from Tom Silverstein of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:\n\nPractice pool report from me: The #Packers held their stretch inside the CRIC.

    "fullText": "Former Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson sparked up an interesting discussion with current Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown recently.\n\nIn an episode of the \"St. Brown Podcast\" released on Wednesday, Jan. 7, Johnson admitted to smoking cannabis before games \"a handful of times\" late in his career, indicating that he used the substance to help deal with pain.\n\n\"I was at this point where I was like, 'Man, I don't know how how the hell I'm going to get through this game today,'\" he said. \"And I'd be like, 'You know what, [expletive] it, I'm gonna spark this thing up.'\"\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Famer is one of the most decorated players in franchise history, reaching the Pro Bowl six times and being named a first-team All-Pro three times in his nine-year career from 2007-15, all spent with the Lions. He eclipsed over 1,000 receiving yards seven times in his NFL career, including in each of his last six seasons before retiring in 2016.\n\nJohnson said he only smoked before home games and doesn't believe the cannabis had a negative impact on his performance.\n\n\"The funny thing is, more times than not, I had a good game, too,\" he said.\n\nJohnson didn't specify when he smoked and which games were impacted, but it may not be a surprise that Johnson used cannabis throughout his career. Johnson advocated for better pain management in his Hall of Fame induction speech and founded cannabis research company Primitiv Group in 2021 with former Detroit Lions guard Rob Sims.\n\nThough cannabis remains a banned substance in the NFL, the league agreed to relax some of its drug policies related to cannabis in 2024, including raising the THC threshold needed to trigger a positive result and lowering fines for offenders.\n\nNeed to catch up on the news during your lunch break? \n\nYou can reach Christian at cromo@freepress.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: Calvin Johnson, ex-Detroit Lions WR, says he smoked pot while playing",

    "fullText": "Algeria's football federation has apologised to a Congolese superfan who has become one of the stars of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) being held in Morocco.\n\nMichel Nkuka Mboladinga has supported the Democratic Republic of Congo by dressing up as the country's revered first leader Patrice Lumumba and remaining stock-still throughout every match.\n\nHe stood on a pedestal with his right arm raised - just like Lumumba's famous statue in DR Congo's capital, Kinshasa - as fans around him cheered.\n\nBut after Algeria beat the Leopards on Tuesday, Algerian player Mohamed Amine Amoura faced a backlash for mimicking Mboladinga and falling to the ground as though the statue had been knocked over.\n\nThis prompted the 25-year-old forward to post an apology on Instagram, saying his gesture was not intended to disrespect DR Congo.\n\nWhy Belgium is returning an African hero's golden tooth\n\nFull BBC Africa football coverage\n\nThe Desert Foxes had looked like they were heading to penalties before Adil Boulbina scored in the 119th minute, securing a place in the quarter-finals where they face Nigeria on Saturday.\n\n\"At that moment, I wasn't aware of what the person or symbol in the stands represented. I simply wanted to joke around, in a good-natured way, without any ill intent or desire to provoke anyone,\" said Amoura, who also plays for German team Wolfsburg.\n\nLumumba is not only seen as a hero in DR Congo, where he was assassinated in 1961 in a plot backed by Belgium, the UK and the US, but is also regarded as one of the most prominent voices in Africa's anti-colonial movement.\n\nAfter the final whistle on Tuesday at Rabat's Moulay Hassan Stadium, which saw the Leopards knocked out of the tournament, Mboladinga - who with his hairstyle and glasses looks remarkably like Lumumba - was visibly distraught.\n\nHe removed his glasses to wipe away some tears, slowly got down from his makeshift plinth and leant against it with his head in his hands.\n\nThe Algerian Football Association (Faf) reached out to Mboladinga following Amoura's contrite statement and invited him to the hotel where the North African team are staying in Rabat to meet the players.\n\nThe superfan was not able to get to Morocco's capital so Faf's media officer Saïd Fellak travelled to Casablanca's Novotel Hotel to see him and other Congolese supporters on Wednesday evening.\n\nThere Fellak presented Mboladinga with his own Desert Foxes jersey with the name \"Lumumba\" printed on the back.\n\nVideos and photos of the entente cordiale, also attended by Congolese Sports Minister Didier Budimbu, were captured by Congolese fans, showing Mboladinga next to Fellak with his new football shirt.\n\nIt is not clear if the Lumumba superfan and his pedestal will make it to Mexico, where the Leopards are expected to play in March's highly anticipated intercontinental World Cup qualifiers.\n\nSix teams will compete to be allocated the final two places up for grabs for the World Cup, which kicks off in June.\n\nAlgeria have already qualified for the tournament that is being jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States - and Amoura hopes that he will get to see the Leopards there too.\n\n\"I respect Congo and their team. Honestly, I wish them the best and hope they qualify for the World Cup,\" he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Algerian football journalist Maher Mezahi\n\nMI6 and the death of Patrice Lumumba\n\n'Our colonial regime was racist' - Belgian king\n\nFalse alarm over DR Congo hero's golden tooth\n\nGo to BBCAfrica.com \n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWashington Huskies quarterback Demond Williams, coming off a 31-total-touchdown season in the Big Ten as a sophomore, announced Tuesday that he would be entering the transfer portal.\n\nIn 2026, that's almost become the norm for big-name college quarterbacks. Plenty of star passers, from Dylan Raiola to DJ Lagway, made exits from their schools this college football offseason. But in Williams' case, his announced decision sparked controversy.\n\nJust days before Williams' transfer announcement, he had reportedly agreed to return to the Huskies for the 2026 season, signing a contract to do so. And in response to his attempted exit, Washington is \"prepared to pursue all legal avenues\" if Williams is not living up to that deal.\n\nHere's everything to know about Demond Williams' transfer portal controversy.\n\nMORE:Tracking the QBs on the move in the transfer portal\n\nWilliams, who spent the first two seasons of his career at Washington and excelled as a sophomore starter in 2025, shared an Instagram post on Tuesday announcing he'd be entering the transfer portal.\n\n\"I have to do what is best for me and my future,\" he wrote. \"After much thought and prayer, I will be entering the transfer portal.\"\n\nThe problem, however, was that Williams had already signed a contract to return to the Huskies last week, per ESPN's Pete Thamel. The deal was reportedly considered \"top of the market,\" and Thamel also added that Williams entered the portal with a \"do not contact\" tag, meaning he likely already had a destination in mind.\n\nAccording to Thamel, Washington is now \"prepared to pursue all legal avenues to enforce Williams' signed contract,\" and the quarterback's situation has also \"drawn the attention of the Big Ten.\"\n\nRoss Dellenger also reported that Washington officials \"suspect\" that another school contacted Williams after he had already signed his Huskies deal. In response, Washington reportedly plans to submit evidence of tampering. On Wednesday, Dellenger added that Big Ten commissioner Tony Pelitti has become \"heavily involved in the matter.\"\n\nAccording to Matt Zenitz, LSU, which is still eyeing a quarterback after landing Lane Kiffin, is expected to be the \"team to watch\" for Williams if he's able to transfer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pete Nakos reported that Washington has no plans to enter Williams' name in the transfer portal due to his signed contract. The Big Ten is \"standing behind UW's fervent approach to the contract,\" per Dellenger.\n\nWashington officials are expected to meet Wednesday with Williams' representatives, and because the Huskies are refusing to enter Williams' name into the portal, he cannot hold conversations with other teams, per Dellenger.\n\nOn Thursday, Williams' agent, Doug Hendrickson, announced that he was dropping Williams as a client due to \"philosophical differences.\"\n\n— Doug Hendrickson (@DHendrickson41) January 8, 2026\n\nMORE: How Lane Kiffin's transfer portal acquisitions at LSU have started roughly\n\nDemond Williams had reportedly agreed to a deal with Washington days before he announced he would be entering the transfer portal.\n\nAn update thread on the Demond Williams situation with Washington, per sources to @YahooSports:\n- Williams signed a one-year rev-share agreement with UW worth about $4M.\n- The agreement is a Big Ten template document used by all league members and built for situations like this.\n\n— Ross Dellenger (@RossDellenger) January 7, 2026\n\nPete Thamel reported that the contract had been \"top of the market,\" while Ross Dellenger reported that Washington officials described the contract as \"a legally binding revenue-share contract with the school.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Ross Dellenger provided further details about the contract. It was a one-year revenue-share agreement with Washington worth about $4 million, per Dellenger. The agreement \"prohibits a player from entering the portal once signed\" and \"prohibits the player’s NIL rights to be used by any other school, though the player can sign outside marketing agreements.\"\n\nThamel also added that the buyout of Williams' contact reads the cost of the buyout is in the “sole discretion” of Washington, and it specifically states that “the institution is not obligated to enter the Student-Athlete into the transfer portal or otherwise assist or facilitate the Student-Athlete’s transfer to another college or university.”\n\nHere's a look at Williams' numbers through two seasons at Washington.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal",

    "fullText": "Puka Nacua just turned in one of the best seasons ever by a wide receiver, leading the way for the Los Angeles Rams in Year 3 with the team. He caught an NFL-high 129 passes, finished second with 1,715 receiving yards and led the league with an average of 107.2 receiving yards per game.\n\nHis 1,7,15 yards are the 14th-most all-time in a single season and his 129 catches are the seventh-most in league history, all despite missing one game and parts of two others.\n\nBased on the betting odds, it seems unlikely that Nacua will win Offensive Player of the Year over Jaxon Smith-Njigba, but Pro Football Focus recognized his greatness this season. PFF named Nacua its Offensive Player of the Year on Thursday thanks to his prolific 2025 campaign.\n\nNacua set the all-time wide receiver record with a season grade of 96.3 and had the most contested catches ever in a single season, hauling in 27 such receptions. His 3.71 yards per route run are also the third-most ever in PFF history.\n\nPuka Nacua: PFF’s 2025 Offensive Player of the Year\n\n🐏 96.3 PFF grade (PFF record)\n🐏 3.71 yards per route run (3rd in PFF history)\n🐏 27 contested catches (PFF record) pic.twitter.com/gSV1dCd0UW\n\nOf the 10 highest single-game grades by a wide receiver, Nacua now owns two of them: 97.4 in Week 14 and 95.0 in Week 15. Julio Jones is the only other wideout with multiple grades in the top 10; he has three such games, including the second-best.\n\nNacua is the second Rams player to win an award from PFF this year, with Matthew Stafford also being named league MVP. They were two of the best overall players in the NFL regardless of position and PFF rightly recognized how outstanding they were in 2025.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Rams' Puka Nacua wins PFF Offensive Player of the Year",

The longtime Ravens coach is the hottest name on the market and is expected to have several teams that covet his services. Baltimore has an early list of about six coaching candidates, and there could be more after Mike McDaniel was fired on Thursday.\n\nFans and the media want answers, and the Ravens will hold a press conference with owner Steve Bisciotti and GM Eric DeCosta on Tuesday at 2 p.m.\n\nThis will mark the first time the Ravens have spoken publicly since firing coach John Harbaugh.\n\nThe Ravens will hold a press conference with owner Steve Bisciotti and GM Eric DeCosta on Tuesday at 2 p.m.\n\nThis will mark the first time the Ravens have spoken publicly since firing coach John Harbaugh.\n\n— Jamison Hensley (@jamisonhensley) January 8, 2026\n\nThe Ravens finished the 2025 season 8-9 after starting 1-5 and missing the playoffs. Baltimore was 0-4 this season in games decided by 5 points or fewer, and overall, under Harbaugh, the Ravens are 45-61 in such games since 2008.\n\nHarbaugh (18th season) is the NFL's second-longest-tenured head coach (Mike Tomlin - 19), with his 193 total wins tying Chuck Knox for the 12th most by a HC in NFL history. Harbaugh has led Baltimore to 12 playoff berths in the past 18 seasons and to six postseason appearances in the last eight years. Still, relationships sometimes get stale, and while he's a quality head coach who'll have suitors on the open market, Harbaugh's act and message have fallen on deaf ears in the Ravens locker room.

    "fullText": "All year, I’ve had fun tracking what I call the “Hafley Cam” during games. You know it. It’s the shot of Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley up in the crow’s nest during a big defensive moment. On my podcast, I placed a few silly prop bets related to the Hafley Cam. Do we see him drinking Diet Coke more than once this season? What about a Redbull? Another prop was related to Hafley being talked about as a head coach candidate during a Hafley Cam shot. While we fell just short on our beverage props this year (one instance total for each beverage, if you’re curious), we hit our head coach prop midway through the first game of the season.\n\nI tell you this for two reasons. Firstly, to get an easy plug in for my podcast. Second is that as the Packers head into the playoffs this year, it seems likelier than ever that Hafley will be a finalist for an open head coaching job.\n\nIn fact, my colleague Evan “Tex” Western already wrote about the first interview request being made official by the Tennessee Titans.\n\nOther teams are sure to follow. Vacancies as of today also include Baltimore, Miami, Atlanta, Cleveland, Las Vegas, Arizona, and the New York Giants. Talk about a bloodbath.\n\nThis has put me in a rather reflective mood. Jeff Hafley has been a breath of fresh air for Packers fans after years in the DC wilderness. He may not have his star pass rusher, but I am genuinely curious to see what Hafley cooks up against the Bears (and beyond, if they win), with everything on the line, and with a slew of coach-needy execs watching closely. Show us what you’ve got, Haf.\n\nAnd if you could also make sure to drink a Diet Coke or a Redbull on camera Saturday, that’d be swell, too.

    "fullText": "We are now fully into the year 2026 and just about into the spring semester at most colleges. Depending on where you live, it might not feel especially like spring yet, but several of the designated “spring sports” will get their seasons going in the coming weeks and months.\n\nOne of those sports is lacrosse, with the North Carolina Tar Heels’ men opening their season on February 1st, and the reigning national champion women getting going a few days later on the 7th. In the case of both teams, they’ll go into the 2026 seasons with high expectations, as both will be in their respective preseason top fives.\n\nEarlier this week, USA Lacrosse released their preseason rankings for 2026. For the 2025 champ Tar Heels, the expectations remain the same, as they’ll go into 2026 as the #1 team in the nation.\n\nThe 2026 Tar Heels will return several key players from last year’s national champions, including Chloe Humphrey, who won the Tewaaraton Award as the nation’s best player. Also not shockingly, considering how often Jenny Levy’s team has contended in recent years, they’ll also enroll the top-ranked recruiting class.\n\nComing in second in the women’s poll was Northwestern, whom UNC beat in the championship game last year. Fellow ACC teams Boston College, Stanford, Virginia, Clemson, Syracuse, and Duke also appear in the rankings.\n\nOver on the men’s side of things, UNC will begin the year at #5. Unlike the women, the Carolina men aren’t coming off a championship or an especially dominant season. While they received the #8 seed in last year’s NCAA Tournament, they exited with a first round loss to Richmond.\n\nThe 2026 squad is clearly expected to take a step forward. Including 2025 first team-er Brady Wambach, Carolina has four 2025 All-Americans back, and also will enroll a highly ranked recruiting class. Despite the early exit last year, the Heels went 10-5 and returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in a couple years. With the amount of talent back and incoming, it’s expected for them to take a jump up in the ACC.\n\nThe #1 team in the men’s preseason poll is Maryland, followed by Syracuse, who are the ACC’s top team in the preseason. Joining the Orange and the Tar Heels in USA Lacrosse’s Top 20 are ACC foes Notre Dame, Duke, and Virginia.\n\nWhile the women have been especially dominant in recent years, the men also have a national championship in recent memory. Here’s to one — or ideally, both — adding to the university’s national title tally in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Every year, the NCAA Selection Committee faces the monumental task of seeding the NCAA Tournament, a decision heavily influenced by complex ranking systems. But what exactly are these systems, and how do they determine a team’s fate?\n\nFor decades, the NCAA relied on the RPI, but starting in the 2019 season, a new contender emerged: the NET. This transition wasn’t without its growing pains, sparking immediate controversy among coaches and athletic directors alike. N.C. State Athletic Director Debbie Yow has voiced her disappointment: “Based on the metrics cited above that the NCAA indicated they would use to evaluate team performance, we are disappointed for our athletes, coaches, and fans that our total body of work was not rewarded with selection to the NCAA Tournament.” Similarly, TCU coach Jamie Dixon previously publicly challenged the system: “You look at the NET, there are six teams that had lower NETs than us. They created a tool and talked about it, and then there are six teams there that are lower than us that are in.” (A clear sentiment of a “Power 5” team feeling overlooked.)\n\nWhile the NET system has undergone revisions since its inception, it remains the NCAA’s official ranking tool. But what about other influential metrics like KenPom? This week on Stats Corner, we will break down the old reliable RPI, the controversial NET, and the highly respected KenPom, exploring how each system evaluates and ranks NCAA basketball teams.\n\nLet’s begin with the RPI, the NCAA’s standard from 1981 to 2018. At its core, the RPI was a straightforward win/loss formula:\n\nRPI = (WP * 0.25) + (OWP * 0.50) + (OOWP * 0.25)\n\nWP (Winning Percentage): The team’s own winning percentage, calculated by dividing wins by total games played. This accounted for 25% of the RPI.\n\nOWP (Opponents’ Winning Percentage): The combined winning percentage of a team’s opponents, contributing a significant 50%.\n\nOOWP (Opponents’ Opponents’ Winning Percentage): The winning percentage of those opponents’ opponents, making up the final 25%.\n\nWhat becomes immediately clear is that a substantial 75% of a team’s RPI was determined not by their own record, but by the performance of their Strength of Schedule (SOS) – specifically, how well their opponents, and their opponents’ opponents, performed. This emphasis rewarded teams playing tougher schedules. For instance, as of now, Boise State sits 18th in RPI at 0.637, narrowly ahead of Utah State at 22nd with 0.629, while Air Force lags at 304th with 0.423.\n\nWith the 2019 season came the NET: NCAA Evaluation Tool. And while the NCAA can royally screw things up, they did nailed the acronym. Unlike the formulaic RPI, the NET is a predictive-learning model, leveraging machine learning to simulate countless game outcomes. It constantly compares expected results with actual outcomes, adjusting its model dynamically.\n\nUpon its introduction, the NET considered five primary factors:\n\nTeam Value Index: A holistic measure considering opponent quality, game location, and the ultimate winner.\n\nNet Efficiency: The difference between a team’s offensive and defensive efficiency.\n\nWinning Percentage: A straightforward measure of wins versus losses.\n\nAdjusted Win Percentage: This factor heavily weighed game location, rewarding road wins and penalizing home losses.\n\nScoring Margin: Designed to reward dominant wins, though capped at 10 points to prevent extreme blowouts from skewing results.\n\nAn important note: the NET treats all games equally, regardless of when they are played in the season. A November clash carries the same weight as a February showdown, irrespective of team evolution or injuries.\n\nThe Quadrant System: A Game Changer\n\nOne of the most talked-about aspects of the NET is its Quadrant System, which categorizes wins and losses based on the opponent’s NET ranking and game location. You’ll often hear commentators discussing “Quad 1” or “Quad 2” records, and for good reason—these classifications significantly impact a team’s resume.\n\nThe quadrants are defined as follows:\n\nQuadrant 1: Home 1-30; Neutral 1-50; Away 1-75\n\nQuadrant 2: Home 31-75; Neutral 51-100; Away 76-135\n\nQuadrant 3: Home 76-160; Neutral 101-200; Away 136-240\n\nQuadrant 4: Home 161-plus; Neutral 201-plus; Away 241-plus\n\nNew Mexico (currently 46th NET): Holds a 1-2 record in Quad 1 games, 2-1 in Quad 2, and a perfect 5-0 in Quad 3.\n\nBoise State (currently 44th NET): Shows a 2-4 Quad 1 record, 3-0 in Quad 2, and 2-1 in Quad 3.\n\nWhile Boise State has more losses (4 losses to 8 wins) compared to New Mexico (3 losses to 11 wins), their losses are against higher-caliber, Quad 1 opponents, which mitigates the negative impact on their ranking. New Mexico, despite fewer losses, has fewer Quad 1 wins and a critical Quad 3 loss. A Quad 1 or 2 loss isn’t a “deal-breaker,” but a Quad 3 or 4 loss can severely hurt a team’s tournament aspirations.\n\nThe fluidity of these rankings throughout the season is fascinating. A win that starts as Quad 1 can drop to Quad 2 or even 3 if the opponent’s NET ranking falls. This creates an interesting dynamic where teams often find themselves rooting for their past opponents to perform well!\n\nNevada, currently 75th, means a game at Nevada would be a Quad 1 opportunity for San Diego State. However, for Utah State hosting Nevada, it would be a Quad 2 game.\n\nIf Nevada then loses to Wyoming (86th) at home, that becomes a Quad 3 loss for Nevada, which could lower their overall NET ranking. This, in turn, could downgrade San Diego State’s Quad 1 win against Nevada to a Quad 2, and Utah State’s Quad 2 game to a Quad 3.\n\nSimilarly, Utah State’s initial Quad 1 loss to South Florida became a Quad 2 loss after the Bulls dropped to 76th following losses to UAB (110th).  If the Bulls lose at North Texas, 151th, and home to East Carolina, 307th, it may become a Quad 3 loses for the Aggies, or South Florida could beat Tulsa, 41st, on the road and go back to Utah State Quad 1 loss. The continuous shifts demonstrate why these rankings are constantly scrutinized.\n\nRecognizing some of the initial criticisms, the NCAA refined the NET in 2020, dropping winning percentage, adjusted winning percentage, and scoring margin from its core calculations. Now, the key factors influencing a team’s NET ranking are:\n\nEfficiency: The difference between offensive and defensive points per possession.\n\nStrength of Opponents Played: The quality of the teams on their schedule.\n\nGame Location: Where the game was played still matters for quadrant classification.\n\nWins and Losses: The fundamental outcome of games.\n\nWinner: Who ultimately won the contest.\n\nBeyond the NCAA’s official metrics, independent analytics Ken Pomeroy offers his highly influential KenPom rankings. Operating from his own autonomous website, KenPom assigns every NCAA team an Adjusted Efficiency Margin (AEM), calculated as Adjusted Offensive Efficiency minus Adjusted Defensive Efficiency.\n\nYou might be thinking, “Isn’t that what the NET does?” And you’re partially right, but with two crucial distinctions:\n\nKenPom came first. It’s the pioneer in this analytical approach.\n\nIt’s all about “Adjusted” efficiency. While team efficiency typically measures points scored per 100 possessions, KenPom’s adjustment accounts for the pace of play and the number of possessions a team accumulates per game.\n\nConsider this: Purdue, for example, boasts an exceptional offensive efficiency, projected to score 129 points per 100 possessions. However, their adjusted team efficiency is 65.8 possessions per 40-minute game, ranking them 313th nationally in pace. This means the Boilermakers are highly effective with fewer possessions, outperforming a team like last in the nation, Colorado State (63.0 possessions) even if they run fewer plays.\n\nLet’s explore some of KenPom’s key metrics, using Utah State (26th in KenPom, 16th in NET) as our example. Interestingly, KenPom and NET often show discrepancies; for instance, KenPom places San Diego State at 49th, Boise State at 51st, and New Mexico at 54th, while the NET has them at 60th, 44th, and 46th respectively, highlighting the differing methodologies.\n\nAdjusted Efficiency Margin (NetRtg): This is KenPom’s ultimate ranking metric. A higher score indicates a better team. For Utah State, an AEM of 21.17 (26th nationally) suggests they would defeat an average NCAA team by approximately 21 points.\n\nAdjusted Offensive Efficiency (ORtg) and Adjusted Defensive Efficiency (DRtg): These metrics, as discussed, quantify how efficiently a team scores and defends, adjusted for pace. Utah State, for example, has an ORtg of 120.7 (25th) and a DRtg of 99.5 (36th).\n\nAdjusted Tempo (AdjT): This measures the average number of possessions a team has per game, adjusted to a standard 40-minute contest. It’s calculated with the formula: Possessions per game = Field goals attempted – offensive rebounds + turnovers + 0.475 x attempted free throws. This adjustment is crucial for comparing “run-and-gun” teams with slower, grind-it-out squads. Utah State plays at a slightly quicker pace with an AdjT of 69.7, ranking 117th.\n\nLuck Rating: This fascinating metric quantifies a team’s performance in close games. Statistically, teams are expected to win roughly 50% of one-possession games. The luck rating reveals the deviation from this expectation. A positive rating means a team is “luckier” by winning more than their share of tight contests. Utah State’s luck rating of 0.071 (66th) suggests they’ve been fortunate in close finishes. In contrast, 9-5 Wichita State is the unluckiest team (-0.211), while 11-4 Tulane is the luckiest (0.254), meaning the American Conference has both the luckiest and unluckiest teams in the country.\n\nStrength of Schedule (SOS): KenPom’s SOS is based on the average Adjusted Efficiency Margin, Offensive Efficiency, and Defensive Efficiency of a team’s opponents. A higher SOS indicates a tougher slate of games. Utah State’s opponents, for instance, have an average AEM of 2.07, signifying the 127th toughest schedule nationally, meaning the Aggies’s opponents typically win their games by an average of 2 points.\n\nNon-Conference Strength of Schedule (NCSOS): This metric rewards teams that actively seek out challenging non-conference matchups rather than “cupcake” games. Since conference schedules are largely predetermined, the NCSOS reflects a team’s commitment to building a strong resume. Utah State’s average non-conference schedule (151st with an AEM of 0.61) shows a balanced approach. Compare this to Wyoming’s 307th NCSOS (-3.95 AEM), indicating their non-conference opponents typically lost by 4 points. The range is vast, from Fordham’s easiest NCSOS (-11.68) to Alabama’s hardest (12.45).\n\nWhile both the NET and KenPom strive to quantify team strength, their methodologies lead to distinct differences:\n\nGame Location: The NET heavily integrates game location (home, neutral, away) into its quadrant system, crucially impacting win/loss value. KenPom, on the other hand, does not factor game location directly into its core efficiency rankings.\n\nEfficiency Calculation: KenPom utilizes adjusted efficiency, accounting for a team’s pace of play and number of possessions per game. The NET focuses on points per 100 possessions regardless of the pace, which can sometimes favor slower teams with fewer, more efficient possessions differently.\n\nScoring Margin: KenPom does consider scoring margin as part of its efficiency calculations. The NET initially included it but has since removed it as a direct factor, though efficiency still captures some aspects of dominance.\n\nWins & Losses: KenPom primarily focuses on efficiency and predictive metrics; wins and losses are an outcome, not a direct input for its core ranking calculations. The NET, while incorporating efficiency, still fundamentally uses wins and losses, particularly through its quadrant system, as a direct input for ranking.\n\nMethodology: KenPom relies on a strict, formulaic (predictive) approach to generate its rankings. The NET employs a more dynamic learning algorithm that continually compares expected outcomes against actual results, adjusting its model accordingly.\n\nUnderstanding these intricate ranking systems—RPI, NET, and KenPom—is essential for any serious college basketball fan. They each offer a unique lens through which to view team performance, highlighting different strengths and weaknesses. While the NCAA’s NET system serves as the official gauge for tournament selection, independent metrics like KenPom provide valuable context and often spark informed debate. As the season progresses, watching how these numbers fluctuate and what they reveal about teams beyond their simple win-loss record will make following college basketball even more compelling.",

    "title": "New York Jets - Picking 16: A Preliminary View",
    "description": "An Early Look At The Four Most Mocked Players The Jets Could Select With The 16th Pick",
    "fullText": "Well, the season is over. The tank is complete, and after weeks of speculation, the Jets will be picking No. 2 overall.\n\nAt No. 2, there are still plenty of questions about what direction they take. If Dante Moore declares, the debate will almost certainly center on whether the Jets go quarterback, trade back, or simply take the best player on the board. That discussion is fairly straightforward and will dominate much of the early draft conversation.\n\nHowever, there’s another pick the Jets own that isn’t getting nearly the same level of attention.\n\nThanks to the Colts’ collapse down the stretch and their failure to make the playoffs, the pick they traded to the Jets now lands in the top half of the draft. For a team with holes all over the roster, that’s a massive asset.\n\nWe’ll dive much deeper into these prospects as we get closer to April, and it’s important to note that draft boards can change rapidly between January and draft night. But for now, let’s take a brief look at the four most popular players players mocked to the Jets with this pick:\n\nBailey immediately emerges as a popular potential target for the Jets.\n\nA four-year senior who began his career at Stanford before transferring to Texas Tech, Bailey has been on draft radars for the better part of the last two years. However, it was his senior season that truly launched his draft stock. After entering the year viewed as more of a mid–second-round prospect, Bailey has climbed to consensus No. 11 overall on most big boards.\n\nThe book on Bailey is fairly simple: he’s an elite college pass rusher.\n\nAfter two solid seasons at Stanford, Bailey took a major leap in his junior year, becoming one of the highest-graded pass rushers in the country. With a larger national stage at Texas Tech, he only continued that ascent, arguably becoming the most dominant pass rusher in college football this past season. With better coverage behind him, his sack total also exploded with 15 sacks this past year.\n\nBailey is the highest-graded pass rusher in the country on both true pass sets and overall snaps. He leads the nation in PRP—a PFF metric that combines sacks, hits, and hurries relative to pass-rush opportunities—and also ranks first in win rate on true pass sets, measuring how often he beats his blocker on non-penalty pass-rush snaps.\n\nThe athletic profile jumps off the page as well. Bailey is fast, explosive, and incredibly productive. He reportedly bench-pressed 405 pounds, squatted 550, and has been clocked at 22.16 mph. There’s a lot to like.\n\nThe concerns, however, are also easy to spot.\n\nBailey is undersized, listed at 250 pounds (a number that appears generous given he doesn’t look much different from the 240 pounds he was listed at during his Stanford days). That size raises legitimate questions about his ability to set the edge, hold up against the run, and rein in some of his more reckless tendencies.\n\nUltimately, there are two very different ways to view Bailey depending on the story you are going to tell yourself. On one hand, you’re getting a freaky, explosive, highly productive pass rusher, something the Jets desperately need. On the other, you may be drafting a situational edge defender who can’t consistently stay on the field for all three downs due to size limitations.\n\nWith Will McDonald already on the roster and facing similar concerns, it remains to be seen whether the Jets would be willing to take another swing on this type of profile.\n\nKeldric Faulk:\n\nWe’ll continue the trend of examining potential pass rushers at pick No. 16, but this one couldn’t be more different from David Bailey.\n\nKeldric Faulk is a specimen. If you were designing an NFL edge rusher in a lab, it would look a lot like Faulk. He stands 6’6”, carries long arms, and weighs in at 285 pounds a drastically different body type than the Jets’ current edge rushers in Will McDonald and Jermaine Johnson.\n\nFaulk is also a completely different type of player than Bailey. While Bailey lined up almost exclusively outside the offensive tackle, Faulk has been used all over the front. Over the past two seasons, he’s aligned outside the tackle roughly 55–60% of the time, but Auburn has also deployed him over tackles and even inside over guards. He’s been asked to do everything.\n\nThat versatility shows up most clearly against the run. Faulk has graded extremely well in run defense, ranking in the top 25 in both stop rate and run-defense grade in each of the last two seasons. What makes that even more impressive is his age, he’s been doing this at 19 and 20 years old in the SEC.\n\nThe pass-rushing profile, however, is very much a work in progress and that’s where the concerns begin.\n\nMost notably, Faulk took a step back as a pass rusher this season. After recording nine sacks as a 19-year-old sophomore, his sack total dropped to just two this past year. His underlying metrics tell a similar story, as he ranked outside the top 50 in both pressure rate and win rate. There is an important caveat here: pressure and win rates tend to decline when a player isn’t used primarily as a stand-up edge rusher outside the tackle. Still, the pass-rush skill set clearly needs refinement.\n\nFaulk will be one of the more fascinating evaluations in this class, particularly depending on how he tests. On first glance, he appears plenty athletic (especially for his size) and it’s notable how well he already carries his frame at just 20 years old. It’s easy to see why he’s been viewed as a mid–first-round pick at worst for much of the year.\n\nThe questions, however, are largely tied to projection.\n\nThe best-case scenario is a complete edge defender: a powerful run stopper who leverages his size and athleticism into becoming a legitimate plus pass rusher at the next level. The concern is more straightforward, he never fully develops the pass-rushing tools needed to consistently win in the NFL.\n\nThat variance is what makes Faulk such a fascinating, and potentially polarizing, option for the Jets at No. 16.\n\nMoving away from edge rusher to another position of need, wide receiver will undoubtedly be one of the most talked-about spots to address in this year’s draft especially if the Jets do select a quarterback at pick No. 2. Makai Lemon, by all accounts, appears to be a very legitimate option considering where he ranks on consensus big boards. Over the last three months of the draft process, Lemon has hovered anywhere from the early 20s to as high as No. 16, where he currently sits on several boards.\n\nLemon is a fascinating evaluation. From a production standpoint, it’s hard to find many receivers as consistently productive as he’s been. After entering USC as a highly rated recruit, Lemon broke out during his sophomore season, finishing with 52 catches for 764 yards and three touchdowns on 67 targets. From an efficiency perspective, he was outstanding—posting a high catch rate while adding an elite 3.03 yards per route run.\n\nAt just 21 years old, Lemon took another leap as a junior and emerged as one of the best wide receivers in college football. He finished the season as the highest-graded receiver in the country, totaling 79 catches, 1,156 yards, and 11 touchdowns. Among qualified Power Four receivers, he ranked third nationally in yards per route run and finished top 10 in missed tackles forced, drop rate, and passer rating when targeted. Any way you slice it, Lemon was both dominant and efficient.\n\nThe main concern with Lemon, (and the first thing evaluators will point to) is his size. Listed at 5’11”, 195 pounds, Lemon spent most of his time at USC operating out of the slot. While he did expand his role this season, he still lined up outside on just 28% of his snaps.\n\nThat leads to the obvious questions: can Lemon consistently beat press man coverage at the NFL level against bigger, more physical defensive backs? And does the lack of true top-end speed (he’s rumored to run in the 4.45–4.50 range) cap his upside? Those answers will come with time.\n\nThe Jaxson Smith-Njigba comparison is going to come up frequently throughout this draft cycle given how similar their profiles are in terms of size, production, usage, and athleticism. But one thing is clear: if you’re looking for an advanced route runner with elite production, there simply aren’t many better options in this draft than Makai Lemon.\n\nWe’ll close out this article with our final player and undoubtedly the most polarizing name on the list: Peter Woods.\n\nWoods has been in the spotlight for a long time now. The buzz around him has been loud for nearly two years, dating back to when he burst onto the scene at Clemson as a true freshman. From the very beginning, Woods was a very good player.\n\nAt just 18 years old, Woods made an immediate impact. During his freshman season, while primarily playing as a 1-tech and 3-tech, he established himself as an elite run defender. He finished as a top-eight run defender in the country by PFF grade and ranked second nationally among all defensive linemen in stop rate. For an 18-year-old freshman playing in the Power Four, that level of production is remarkable.\n\nHe followed up his breakout freshman year with another strong campaign as a sophomore. Clemson used him differently, lining him up more frequently as a traditional defensive end and even placing him outside the tackles at times. As a result, his pass-rush metrics took a step forward. Despite still spending the majority of his snaps inside, Woods graded well as a pass rusher when asked to attack the quarterback. His win rate ranked top 10 nationally among non-edge rushers, and in true pass sets—albeit on a smaller sample—he finished top 15 at the position.\n\nBecause of that trajectory, Woods entered the season as a consensus top-five prospect. He also earned a spot on Bruce Feldman’s Freaks List, where Feldman wrote:\n\n“His latest body composition scans prior to camp showed that 240 of his 310 pounds are lean muscle mass. He’s a rare combination of power and speed for a 300-plus-pounder. This offseason, Woods bench pressed 490 pounds and did 34 reps of 225. He squatted 700 pounds and power cleaned 385, ran a 4.86 40-yard dash and vertical jumped 33 inches.”\n\nUnfortunately, Woods’ junior season was a clear disappointment. He moved back exclusively to the interior, and his production and grading took a noticeable step back. From a win-rate and pressure standpoint, he fell outside the top 50 among qualified defensive linemen. It’s fair to note that producing high pressure and win rates is more difficult when playing nose tackle and interior defensive line, but even accounting for alignment, his results were underwhelming compared to peers in similar roles. The dominant run defense he showed early in his career also regressed.\n\nAs a result, Woods has slid from being a consensus top-five player on big boards to someone who could legitimately fall out of the top half of the first round on draft night.\n\nWoods remains a fascinating evaluation. From a size and athleticism standpoint, he checks every box at 6’3”, 315 pounds. He’s shown flashes of high-level play as both a run defender and a pass rusher. But it’s impossible to ignore the step back in performance this past season. Simply put, he’s well behind the sack and tackle-for-loss production you’d typically expect from a defensive lineman selected in the middle of the first round. A concern to say the least.\n\nAs previously mentioned, these rankings are cyclical by nature. While these four players are the most commonly mocked to the Jets at this point in the process, it’s unlikely they’ll be the same names we’re seeing come April once testing results and additional information start to reshape boards.\n\nWe’ll continue to monitor the class and take a deeper look at all of these prospects (including those listed above) over the coming months.",

    "fullText": "Inter are reportedly tracking Robinho Jr, the teenage forward at Santos and son of former Milan, Manchester City and Real Madrid attacker Robinho.\n\nAccording to Brazilian outlet UOL Esporte, via CalcioMercato, the Nerazzurri have identified the 18-year-old as a potential long-term investment and have already begun laying the groundwork behind the scenes.\n\nJournalist Lucas Musetti claims Inter have earmarked a budget of around €22 million, bonuses included, to pursue the highly-rated attacker, even though no formal bid has yet been submitted to Santos.\n\nSANTOS, BRAZIL – NOVEMBER 01: Robinho Jr of Santos takes a corner kick during a match between Santos and Fortalza as part of Brasileirao 2025 at Urbano Caldeira Stadium (Vila Belmiro) on November 01, 2025 in Santos, Brazil.

While the visit is not understood to be linked to an imminent transfer, it underlines the seriousness of Inter’s interest and the exploratory phase of the talks.\n\nDespite the growing attention from Europe, Robinho Jr’s current preference would be to remain with Santos until at least the end of the season.\n\nThe youngster is keen to continue his development in Brazil before making the leap abroad, though sources indicate that discussions could resume should there be openness from the player, his family and his representatives.\n\nVERONA, ITALY – NOVEMBER 23: Piero Ausilio during the Serie A match at Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi on November 23, 2024 in Verona, Italy.

    "fullText": "It’s early January in Boston. Every day, or so it seems, there is the dreaded wintery of sleet/snow/rain/ice and of course wind. But over the next month there will be more and more stories about guys “in the best shape of his life” and heading to Florida for Spring Training. And as soon as those stories finish we’ll be looking at high-level baseball sooner than you think: the World Baseball Classic runs from March 5th to 17th. Representing teams across the globe, the Red Sox will be represented. According to Chris Cotillo these are the likely participants, although there is some flux.\n\nAroldis Chapman has been included on Great Britain’s preliminary roster but does not appear to be a final candidate yet according to the MLB players listed. Neither do Rafaela, Abreu, or Morán seem to be included on that list. But there are players being announced as additions every day so this may still change.\n\nBut one player has me more interested than other: Roman Anthony.\n\nLast week on the Foul Territory show at about 1:43:16, Kansas City Royals first baseman Vinnie Pasquantino and member of Team Italy admitted to having something of a white whale in recruiting for the WBC: Roman Anthony.\n\nAnd why wouldn’t he? Anthony was only worth 3.1 bWAR in 71 games in 2025 while basically posting the dream .300/.400/.500 slash line of .292/.396/.463. Pasquantino’s entire career, 424 games over 4 years with some injuries, has been 4.9 bWAR. Granted 2025 is 2.4 of that over a span of 160 games so he’s no slouch himself. But Anthony is his prize.\n\nYes, Roman, from Florida, can play for Team USA. But why would you want to?\n\nYou know who doesn’t have an endless supply of guys? Especially high-end outfielders? Italy!\n\nThe average of the projections currently on FanGraphs predict a slash line of .263/.358/.437 with around 20 home runs this year. And about a 3.0 WAR season. Projection systems, of course, feed on prior data which at the major league level Anthony just doesn’t have much of but even if you think that’s his max for a sophomore season guaranteed a starting job and signed for most of the next decade that’s looking pretty good!\n\nWhich, if this is his floor, is all the more reason for Vinnie and Team Italy to make their move now. He literally might not be available for the next WBC because if he looks as good as he did over the summer of 2025, MLB and whoever succeeds Rob Manfred isn’t going to want that guy playing for Italy. They’re fine with lower tier players (Sorry Pasquach) representing an ancestral homeland but not superstars.\n\nIf there is ever a time for Italy to scoop him up it’s now. 2026. Just imagine the face of Team Italy: Roman Anthony.\n\nNow if they can only do something about that hat design…",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball is prepared to produce and distribute local broadcasts for teams whose telecasts are uncertain this season because of the financial problems of the FanDuel Sports Network regional networks.\n\nMain Street Sports Group, which operates the FanDuel networks, did not make its December payment to the St. Louis Cardinals. It also carries games of Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Angels, Miami, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay along with 13 teams in the NBA and seven in the NHL.\n\n“No matter what what happens, whether it’s Main Street, a third party or MLB media, fans are going to have the games,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday.\n\nMLB took over broadcasts for San Diego in May 2023 after Diamond Sports Group missed a payment to the Padres and added Arizona that July.\n\nColorado joined MLB's distribution in 2024, and Cleveland and Minnesota in 2025. Seattle is being added this season and possibly Washington, which is leaving the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\n\nDiamond was renamed Main Street Sports Group as it emerged out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year and its networks were rebranded as FanDuel.\n\n“Our focus, particularly given the point in the calendar, is to maximize the revenue that’s available to the clubs, whether that’s MLB Media or third party,” Manfred said. “The clubs have control over the timing. They can make a decision to move to MLB Media because of the contractual status now. I think that what's happening right now clubs are evaluating their alternatives. Obviously they’ve made significant payroll commitments already and they’re evaluating the alternatives to find the best revenue source for the year and the best outlet in terms of providing quality broadcasts to their fans.”\n\nManfred said local media provides more than 20% of industry revenue.\n\nMLB and the players' association for 2024 allowed discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue had declined since 2022 or 2023, but they did not reach a similar agreement for 2025.\n\n“We are not providing financial assistance right now,” Manfred said.\n\nHe spoke at a news conference to announce an initiative with Foster Love that envisions 250,000 volunteer hours to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States.

    "description": "Chet Holmgren steps up in Oklahoma City Thunder's much-needed win over Utah Jazz.",
    "fullText": "Boxing out Lauri Markkanen, Chet Holmgren grabbed a critical miss. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's spin move couldn't result in a go-ahead bucket with 22 seconds left in overtime. Before folks could even process the consequences, the 23-year-old slammed down a second-chance dunk.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder survived a potential disaster with a 129-125 overtime win over the Utah Jazz. Once up by 20 points on the rebuilding squad, it looked like they were on their way to their first three-game losing streak in two seasons.\n\nHolmgren finished with 23 points on 9-of-15 shooting, 12 rebounds and one assist. He shot 0-of-3 from 3 and went 5-of-8 on free throws. He also had three blocks and a steal.\n\nThe old sports cliche goes that it's not about how you start, but how you finish. Holmgren exemplified that. He scored 12 points in the fourth quarter and overtime as he grinded out the final 17 minutes of game time in a contest the Thunder badly needed.\n\nIt was a busy night at the paint for Holmgren. The Jazz have a couple of large bodies, but Markkanen and Jusuf Nurkic aren't exactly known as rim protectors. The Thunder spammed several alley-oops to him as some microwavable offense. When that didn't happen, he was there to crash the glass and get some second-chance scores.\n\nOn the other end, Holmgren stepped up when needed. Sure, the Jazz sliced through OKC's paint defense. But the seven-footer's presence down the stretch forced Utah to play out some carnival-like possessions where it resorted to throwing up some wild shot attempts.\n\nReviewing the film, there are definitely things that could be corrected in the first three quarters. But what Holmgren did in the final 17 minutes showed you why he was one of the biggest contributors to OKC's championship last season. At the highest-pressure spots, he helped the Thunder continue to roll along and got enough stops.\n\n\"If you're feeling tired, they're feeling tired. Just continuing to try and really just hammer away at what we do. Down the stretch, we were able to get some good cracks and get some high percentage plays. Whether it was some drives to the paint, some dump-offs for finishes or putbacks. Whatever it might be,\" Holmgren said. \"I think we did a really good job of not straying away from what we do. Even though there were points in the game that were challenging. It worked out for us in the end.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Chet Holmgren steps up in Thunder's much-needed win over Jazz",

    "fullText": "Liverpool have got a need for senior centre-back reinforcements.\n\nThe injury suffered by Giovanni Leoni - combined with uncertainty over the futures of Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez - means the Reds are perilously close to being left short in the position.\n\nNoah Adekoya, Talla Ndiaye and Ifeanyi Ndukwe will no doubt go on to have successful senior careers - but Liverpool’s needs are for the here and now.\n\nThe Premier League champions missed out on the signing of Marc Guehi on transfer deadline say - with Crystal Palace determined to keep hold of their captain.\n\nSporting director Richard Hughes offered an initial £35m for the England international - but the FA Cup holders pulled out of the deal at the last minute.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nLiverpool are among the teams still keen on recruiting Guehi - with the player having already once agreed personal terms with the Anfield club.\n\nBut there is a danger presented by Manchester City in the winter window as Pep Guardiola deals with a centre-back shortage.\n\nThe Cityzens are reportedly ready to offer Palace a cash deal this January in order to avoid the expected free transfer bidding war for Guehi next summer when his Palace deal expires.\n\nAny Liverpool fans hoping that City’s interest would spark a Reds’ retaliation however are going to be disappointed. TEAMtalk is reporting that Hughes is determined to “run the risk” of signing Guehi on a free instead of making a January move.\n\nWith so many teams interested Liverpool are going to have their work cut out in convincing Guehi to choose Merseyside as his next destination.\n\nSuitors are not only present in the Premier League as Barcelona, Real Madrid and Inter Milan are all reckoned to have taken a look at Guehi.\n\nLiverpool will therefore ignore the chance to do a cut-price deal for Guehi and instead aim their firepower at putting together a lucrative package for the defender to join in summer.",

    "fullText": "As Demond Williams Jr. looks to leave Washington, his agent said Thursday that he’s no longer representing the Huskies’ QB.\n\nDoug Hendrickson said in a social media post that he had “made the decision to end my representation of Demond Williams Jr. effective immediately due to philosophical differences.” Hendrickson, who is part of the Wasserman Football agency, said that he wished “him and his family the best in their future endeavors.”\n\nHendrickson is also the agent for Washington coach Jedd Fisch.\n\nYahoo Sports’ Ross Dellenger reported Wednesday that Williams had signed a one-year deal with Washington for the 2026 season that was worth approximately $4 million. Per that agreement, the school can prohibit Williams from entering the portal after the deal is signed and the deal also forbids another school to use the player’s NIL rights.\n\nSince Williams hasn’t been officially entered into the transfer portal, NCAA rules prohibit him from talking to other schools. However, coaches across the country have been speaking out against tampering for months. And it’s hard to believe that many — if any — coaches who have publicly complained about tampering haven’t at least indirectly engaged it in themselves.\n\n- UW officials suspect that Williams has already held conversations with other programs and the school plans to submit any tampering evidence to the league and NCAA.\n- LSU is believed to be the school most interested in Williams.\n\n— Ross Dellenger (@RossDellenger) January 7, 2026\n\nLSU has been mentioned heavily as a school with interest in Williams. Lane Kiffin is searching for a transfer quarterback ahead of the 2026 season as Cincinnati’s Brendan Sorsby committed to Texas Tech and current Ole Miss QB Trinidad Chambliss is set to stay with the Rebels if the NCAA will grant him a sixth year of eligibility.\n\nWilliams would immediately become the best available QB if and when he enters the transfer portal. He was 246-of-354 passing for 3,065 yards and 25 TDs across 13 games while also rushing 143 times for 611 yards and six scores.",

    "fullText": "Racing Club has made the most talked-about move of the summer by securing the signing of Valentín Carboni. The talented midfielder joins on a one-year loan from Inter Milan, where he wasn't getting the desired playing time. After passing the medical examination last Wednesday, the player travels today to Paraguay to join the preseason and come under the orders of Gustavo Costas.\n\nOne of the curiosities of his arrival is the number he will wear. Carboni will don the number 21 jersey, a number with recent history in Avellaneda: it was left vacant by the historic goalkeeper Gabriel Arias after his departure and was successfully worn by the Chilean Marcelo Díaz. This gesture symbolizes the importance the club places on the young reinforcement as a key piece for the 2026 season.\n\nAlongside Carboni, Racing had finalized the signing of Matko Miljevic. Huracán had accepted all the terms of the agreement, but in the last few hours, the presidency of the Globo decided to change the conditions. For now, his arrival is uncertain, although those in Avellaneda are confident in resolving the situation.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

Our sample includes more than 50,000 American businesses and billions of dollars in corporate spend using data from Ramp’s corporate card and bill pay platform.\n\nOur work builds on previous work by Bonney et al. (2024) by providing a new dataset to measure firm adoption of artificial intelligence. Previous work has relied almost entirely on surveys that ask businesses if they use AI, but surveys may lead to underreporting of actual AI adoption, particularly when questions are unclear or when adoption of a new technology is rising very quickly. Using contract and transaction data from corporate spend with AI companies, we produced a more timely and accurate measurement of AI adoption by U.S. businesses.\n\nOur transaction set is built using company models that extract line-item text from paid receipts and bills uploaded by the purchaser following a sale. Firms are considered to have adopted AI tools if they have a positive transaction amount for an AI product or service in a given month. AI products and services are identified using merchant name and line item details from receipts and bills.\n\nFirms are assigned to industry sectors using internal company models that predict the relevant industry sector using the NAICS standard. Firms are assigned to business size segments using company models that use internal and third-party data on firm revenues and employee counts.\n\nIt’s likely our results underestimate actual adoption rates due to the prevalence of businesses using free AI tools, in which no paid transaction occurs, or when employees use personal accounts with AI companies to complete work tasks.",

    "description": "Read Debugging Hallucinations: A Mechanistic Investigation into Model Confidence on Saumil Srivastava's AI Engineering Blog",
    "fullText": "As engineers, we often treat Large Language Models (LLMs) as opaque inference engines: a prompt enters, text exits, and we evaluate the output based on surface-level correctness.\n\nWhile exploring model failure modes, fabricated citations emerged as a particularly sharp example that standard evaluation metrics failed to capture.\n\nThe model would invent a case—Harrison v. McDonald—and cite it with the precise formatting and tonal confidence of a Supreme Court opinion. The issue wasn't just that the output was factually wrong; it was that the model's internal confidence appeared indistinguishable from when it cited real case law.\n\nI wanted to move beyond \"prompt engineering\" to answer a fundamental question: Can we detect the difference between retrieved knowledge and stochastic pattern matching by observing the model's internal activations?\n\nThis post documents the engineering journey including the failed hypotheses and broken code required to differentiate \"memory\" from \"imagination\" inside a transformer.\n\nTransformers operate on a residual stream, where information accumulates across layers. My working hypothesis was based on two distinct behaviors:\n\nUsing the Logit Lens technique on GPT-2, I visualized this difference.\n\nTo verify this wasn't a visual artifact, I ran a Noise Injection experiment (similar to *Rome et al.*). I injected high-magnitude Gaussian noise (σ=2.0) into intermediate layers to see how fragile the information was.\n\nThe difference in failure modes was visible in the raw console logs.\n\nFactual Prompt: (\"The capital of France is...\")\n\nWhen I corrupted Layer 8, the model performed an Entity Swap.\n\nThe model preserved the structure (Country → Capital) but lost the instance. It \"forgot\" France but still knew it was talking about geopolitics.\n\nHallucinated Prompt: (\"The case of Harrison v. McDonald...\")\n\nWhen I applied the same noise to the fake citation, the model didn't swap names. It experienced Topic Drift.\n\nThe model completely lost the plot. It drifted from \"validity\" to \"privacy\" to \"equal protection\". This suggests that the hallucination failed to maintain a stable intermediate representation; it was a transient surface pattern generated during late-stage completion.\n\nArmed with this insight, I built my first detector. I assumed a sudden \"Confidence Spike\" in the final layer was the unique signature of a lie.\n\nThe Failure: My detector began flagging real facts as hallucinations.\n\nLooking back at my initial code, the bug is obvious. I was calculating risk by subtracting the spike size, effectively rewarding the model for spiking:\n\nThe discriminative signal wasn't the spike itself—both facts and hallucinations spike when the model \"commits\" to an answer. The real signal is the interaction between early entropy and late confidence.\n\nThe Corrected Signal (one effective formulation):\n\nA model that is confident at the end, but was confused in the middle, is likely hallucinating.\n\nThe token-level signal was noisy and prompt-dependent, which is why I moved to span-level aggregation and statistical validation across 60+ prompts.\n\nTo prove this, I ran an Ablation Study. I systematically disabled features to see which ones contributed to the separation between Real and Fake citations.\n\nThe key insight is directional: Confidence alone is inverted it would flag real facts as hallucinations, confirming the Phase 3 bug.\n\nThe signal emerges from the interaction of early entropy and late confidence. Although early entropy alone shows a positive delta, its effect size is small and unstable across prompts, making it insufficient as a standalone signal.\n\nIn my initial notebook, the detector achieved strong separation on a small test set (n=10). Before claiming victory, I expanded the test suite.\n\nThe Humbling: When I scaled to 77 prompts on GPT-2, the signal remained significant (p=0.003)—but the effect size collapsed from Cohen's d=4.73 to d=0.73. The \"perfect\" separation was a small-sample illusion.\n\nThe Pivot: I ported the analysis to Llama-3-8B, a modern RLHF-tuned model, hypothesizing that models trained with human feedback might have more distinct confidence patterns.\n\nThe Result: The signal re-emerged, but it was noisy.\n\n⚠️ *Suspiciously high — small-sample artifact*\n\nInterpretation: Even in heavily fine-tuned models, hallucinations leave a trace. The model is statistically \"more confused\" in the middle layers when lying than when telling the truth. However, an AUC of 0.68 confirms that this signal is noisy ,it is not a silver bullet. The distributions of \"confident truths\" and \"confident lies\" overlap significantly. This progression illustrates how easy it is to overfit mechanistic signals on small, hand-picked sets, and why scaling and re-validation are non-negotiable.\n\nThis finding dictated the final system architecture. If we had an AUC of 0.95, we could build a firewall that auto-blocks hallucinations. With an AUC of 0.68, blocking would flag a substantial fraction of legitimate citations.\n\nCrucial Engineering Detail: Tokens vs. Spans\n\nIn my early experiments, I analyzed raw tokens. This was too noisy—the model might be confident about \"Harrison\" but confused about \"v.\".\n\nI realized that a legal citation is an atomic unit of truth. I refactored the detector to aggregate token probabilities into Span-Level Risk Scores. We don't flag individual tokens; we flag semantic spans that correspond to atomic claims.\n\nThe Pivot: Instead of a \"Blocker,\" I built an Annotator.\n\nThe system calculates the entropy signature on the fly. If the risk score crosses a threshold, we don't silence the model—we inject a visual indicator:\n\nThis converts silent hallucinations into visible uncertainty.\n\nWe often talk about \"Aligning\" AI, but we rarely talk about giving it the tools to know when it is guessing. By looking at the internal physics of the model—specifically the entropy of the residual stream—we can start to distinguish between memory and imagination.\n\nThe journey from \"Logit Lens\" to \"Mechanistic Observability\" wasn't a straight line. It required breaking the \"Confidence\" heuristic, debugging the math, and accepting that mechanistic signals are probabilistic, not binary.\n\nWe didn't solve the problem of hallucinations, but we did solve the problem of silent hallucinations.\n\nCode and Notebooks: GitHub Repo Link\n\nGet weekly insights on AI implementation, performance measurement, and technical case studies.\n\nGet weekly insights on AI implementation and technical case studies.",

    "fullText": "“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.\n\n“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.\n\n“Should I wear a keffiyeh to the shooting range?” Amjad Masad asked as I slid into the passenger seat of his black Mercedes sports car. The patterned Palestinian scarf has become a political lightning rod in the two years since the war in Gaza began. Masad, the founder of AI coding startup Replit, and a Palestinian by origin, wrapped it around his neck anyway.\n\nAt the shooting range in Santa Clara, we collected an assault rifle and a pistol and headed in. With the AR-22 tucked into his shoulder, Masad fired at a brisk clip, peppering bullets into a cartoon burglar. In less than two minutes, the burglar’s head was perfectly pocked with holes.\n\n“You should compete,” I suggested.\n\nHe smirked. “I always compete.”\n\nIndeed, Masad has never been shy about his competitive streak or his political beliefs — especially since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, setting off the war in Gaza.\n\nMasad, 38, has felt obliged to speak out about Gaza ever since, calling out those in tech who, in his view, have supported Israel’s “genocide” of the Palestinian people. He quickly learned just how unpopular that opinion was in Silicon Valley.\n\nParty invitations dried up, group chats lit up with techies condemning his posts, and investors called him a “terrorist sympathizer.” One member of a firm that backed Replit publicly declared (opens in new tab) in July that he would donate any earnings from the investment to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\n“I felt like I was sort of expelled from Silicon Valley,” Masad said in November on the way to the range.\n\nBut even as Silicon Valley cooled on him, the AI boom that Masad had long bet on took off. In 2024, Replit combined its coding tools with AI to create an agent that could turn plain English prompts into pre-coded apps. After nearly a decade, the company was suddenly in the right place at exactly the right time.\n\nTwo years later, Replit is booming. In September, it raised $250 million from Prysm, Andreessen Horowitz, Amex Ventures, and others, at a valuation of $3 billion. The company hopes to create the preeminent AI coder — one so easy to use that anyone can become a software engineer. Meanwhile, Masad continues to advocate for his political beliefs.\n\n“People reached out to me to express that my words have been hurtful and that many have been deeply offended,” he posted on X over the summer (opens in new tab). “I finally realized that I must, from the bottom of my heart, apologize to — absolutely nobody.”\n\nMasad’s swagger isn’t unique among tech founders. But for many, their against-the-grain takes tend to align with the bottom line. Masad insists he speaks up even when it hurts his business. In that regard, “I’m probably the only contrarian in Silicon Valley,” he told me.\n\nAs Replit takes off, will he be able to maintain that independence?\n\nReplit’s multibillion valuation is hitched to the AI boom. Should the boom fizzle, the company could be worth nothing. But if it holds, and AI continues to remake the tech industry and the greater economy, Masad could find himself among the Valley’s next class of billionaires.\n\nReplit has plenty of competition among AI code-to-product firms (which are typically built on top of the mega LLMs). Swedish startup Lovable raised $330 million last month (opens in new tab), and Israeli company Base44 was bought by website builder Wix for $80 million this summer. All told, the AI coding sector received $4.7 billion in U.S. funding in the last year alone, according to PitchBook.\n\nTo persevere, Masad will not only have to beat his competitors with a better product but will have to earn the favor of still more investors, given the massive capital it takes to build and power Replit’s models.\n\nFor this reason, most players in AI have been pragmatic with their politics; see, for instance, how many Silicon Valley figures who previously supported liberal causes — from Marc Benioff to Mark Zuckerberg — suddenly and enthusiastically embraced the Trump White House. Or how Jensen Huang reportedly cozied (opens in new tab) up to David Sacks, hoping the AI czar would convince President Donald Trump to loosen U.S. chip restrictions and allow Nvidia to sell more products globally. Or how Sam Altman has courted Gulf royalty, landing major (opens in new tab) deals to build data centers in the region and fund OpenAI’s stateside infrastructure needs.\n\nFor the most part, Masad has been unwilling to soften his positions. With a penchant for discursive discussions on political philosophy, Masad remains eager to speak about the war in Gaza and rail against what he sees as human rights abuses committed by Israel.\n\nAnd he’s keen to take meetings with anyone who might see eye to eye on Palestine, even if they don’t agree on tech policy. Masad has spoken with New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani and messaged Lina Khan, the former chair of the Federal Trade Commission and nemesis of the tech elite. He had dinner with Tucker Carlson and lasted the obligatory three hours (opens in new tab) on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nIn short, Masad sees himself as both a champion for Palestine and a mogul in waiting. Which, particularly to other Arabs in tech, has made him a hero. “Having one of us make it in Silicon Valley — and still stay vocal on Palestine in the midst of all of this, specifically in Silicon Valley — is extremely inspirational,” said Fadi Ghandour, executive chairman at investment firm Wamda, one of the backers of Replit.\n\nAll this is a world away from Amman, Jordan, where Masad grew up. On the drive from his home in Palo Alto to the gun range, Masad told me his youthful hobbies included drift racing on Amman’s streets and shooting guns in empty lots.\n\nMasad, who speaks unexpectedly softly given his combative persona, is aware of how lucky he is. He compared his circumstances to a simulation experiment in which “if you ran the world a million times, I think 90% of them, I’m in a really bad situation. I’m in prison or dead.” Instead, “somehow I keep surviving and winning.”\n\nReplit’s multibillion valuation was in many ways the fruits of Masad’s decades-long study of how to make it in Silicon Valley. As a teen in Jordan, he avidly followed Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham, studying his blog posts and obsessively scrolling through Hacker News, the Y Combinator news feed.\n\nAfter getting his computer science degree in 2010 from Jordan’s Princess Sumaya University for Technology, he created the first iteration of what would become Replit: an open-source program for coders to work within a web browser, a novelty back when programmers needed to buy specialized software.\n\nHe posted a link to the program on Hacker News, where it went viral. That led to securing his first job in the U.S., as the founding engineer at Codecademy in New York. In 2013, he took a job as a software engineer at Facebook. By 2016, he and his wife, Haya Odeh, decided to revisit his old project from Jordan, officially founding Replit as an online platform to help developers build, collaborate, and publish their software.\n\nAs a student of Silicon Valley, Masad knew that mythmaking was just as important as the product. He began live-blogging Replit’s progress, and his efforts soon caught the attention of Graham himself. “What struck me most about him, at first, was that he was a programmers’ programmer,” Graham said. “He wasn’t just working on software to make money. He’d have been writing it no matter what.”\n\nGraham invited Masad and Odeh to apply to the Y Combinator accelerator program in 2018. They were accepted, and after completing the program, Replit landed investment from Andreessen Horowitz. With that funding and support, Replit gained traction as a tool for students to learn coding and educators to teach it. According to Masad, he turned down a $1 billion acquisition from Github, believing Replit would one day be worth exponentially more.\n\nMasad’s ultimate objective was to leverage his success in tech to help the Palestinian cause — a sentiment instilled in him by his mother. “She would tell me about all the great things I’m gonna do,” he said. “I fantasized as a kid about helping the Palestinians and ending the occupation and being an important force in the world.”\n\nBut in 2019, he effectively put the company on pause after his mother’s cancer took a turn for the worse. Masad and Odeh traveled to be with his father, a civil engineer with the Jordanian government.\n\nThe experience was traumatic for Masad. In his mother’s final days, the doctors in Jordan wouldn’t let any visitors into the ICU. Masad begged, then yelled, and they finally relented — on the condition he sign a “do not resuscitate” order. He still doesn’t understand why. By the time he got to see her, she was unconscious. “I was so angry at modern medicine,” Masad said. “So angry at modernity.” She died shortly thereafter.\n\nAfter a few months, Masad returned to Silicon Valley. He couldn’t stop thinking about civilization at large, about where the world was going, and if he could stand it — or if he could change it. He found himself agreeing with the Valley’s increasingly powerful libertarians.\n\nHe bonded with Marc Andreessen over politics and literature, and traveled to Malaysia to visit Balaji Srinivasan’s mysterious “startup society.” He grew to realize that the limitations he had assumed don’t necessarily apply. “There was an aspect of, like, ‘Fuck the system,’” Masad said. “‘We need to remake civilization.’”\n\nMasad gained a following on Twitter by bantering with tech legends about everything from coding to bitcoin to Covid vaccine skepticism. His growing stature landed him on podcasts and in glowing (opens in new tab) articles in The Wall Street Journal portraying him as a maverick. Then came the ultimate Silicon Valley validation: Graham, the idol whom he’d studied obsessively as a teenager in Jordan, started thanking him in his own blog posts.  (opens in new tab)\n\nMeanwhile, Replit was struggling. The education market turned out to be small, and the company had trouble expanding into enterprise deals. In late 2023, Replit killed its education product and the following year laid off 30 employees — right after moving into a bigger office in Foster City. “I remember walking around the office and just feeling sick to my stomach,” he said. “I felt like I let people down as well, because I sold them this big dream, and it wasn’t working.”\n\nHe had a plan, though, one he hoped would make his odyssey worth it. For years, he had proselytised on podcasts about how AI would turbocharge coding. Replit had spent years building an extensive database of coding materials — he just needed foundational companies like OpenAI and Anthropic to catch up and release an LLM capable of writing code. Once they did, Replit could plug those models into its pre-existing database and create a powerful app-building AI agent.\n\nWhile a new AI coding company would have to build out that infrastructure from scratch, Replit, Masad realized, could start miles ahead. After nearly a decade, he would finally have perfect timing.\n\nMasad had always been outspoken online. After Hamas’ terrorist attacks, as segments of the tech elite publicly lined up behind Israel, he held his ground. And his responses grew more costly.\n\nFirst, there were the public fights. Masad advised Elon Musk (opens in new tab) to “stick to his principles” when the billionaire said the slogan “from the river to the sea” was calling for genocide. (Palestinian activists say it’s a call for the peaceful liberation of the Palestinian people; pro-Israel voices say it calls for the extermination of Israel.) He clapped back (opens in new tab) at Lux Capital founding partner Josh Wolfe, who said that equating Israel’s actions in Gaza to genocide “grotesquely disgraces” Holocaust victims. And when Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures said Masad’s “friends” (opens in new tab) were behind the Oct. 7 attack, Masad challenged him directly.\n\n“If you think my friends did that then why don’t you confront me when you see me?” Masad replied on X (opens in new tab).\n\nBut even as things got noisy in public, Masad met eerie silence professionally. “My calendar was suddenly empty, because I was talking about Palestine,” he said. “Replit was not a hot company anymore. We did a layoff. And at the same time, a lot of my friends were no longer my friends. I was no longer invited to parties.”\n\nPotential partnerships dried up. Masad became a frequent topic in pro-Israel tech groupchats, a source said, where some investors accused him of being antisemitic.\n\nA Replit investor who requested anonymity to speak candidly told me Masad’s public persona has been “really challenging,” and he’s had to defend the founder in investor circles. I asked if Masad had lost business because of his views. “I’m sure the answer is yes,” the investor said.\n\nA startup that Masad had invested in pitched another investor — and found that Masad was a liability. “He said, ‘Oh, Amjad is investing. He’s like a terrorist sympathizer. If he’s investing, I’m not investing,” Masad said he was told, though he declined to name the company or the investor.\n\nBut as Silicon Valley grew chilly, other regions beckoned.\n\nIn April 2024, with Replit a few months from launching its AI agent, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is worth nearly $1 trillion, invited Masad and other AI thought leaders to stay at Ekland Safaris, a property in South Africa linked (opens in new tab) to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nFor Masad, it was a lifeline. Here were potential partners who didn’t care about his politics on Palestine. If anything, his Arab identity and his outspokenness made him more attractive.\n\nIn the heat of the day, a hunting guide sped Masad and other guests, including Tareq Amin, the future CEO of Saudi AI company HUMAIN, across 30,000 acres to kill kudu and wildebeest. By night, guests feasted in a grand ballroom while Masad demoed his not-yet-released AI coding agent to Saudi officials.\n\n“We’re going to be able to give a software engineer to every person,” Masad told Amin. “Anyone in the world will have a software engineer on demand.”\n\nAmin said he thought then that Replit was on “a path to build a game-changing technology.” Indeed, if the agent worked, and if the AI boom Masad had been betting on came to pass, everyone in that room stood to benefit.\n\nReplit launched its AI agent in September 2024 and within a year, revenue had reached $150 million. Amin and Masad closed a deal for Replit to be the exclusive AI coding software for Saudi governmental agencies, a partnership Masad expects to lead to “hundreds of millions” of dollars worth of business.\n\nAnd just like that, Silicon Valley wanted back in. Replit landed enterprise deals with Atlassian and Zillow, with a Meta deal in the wings, according to Masad. Replit raised its $250 million round and scored its $3 billion valuation.\n\nIt helped Masad that, in the two years since Oct. 7, there’s been rising public disapproval (opens in new tab) of the Israeli government. He also gained strength in numbers: There have been high-profile movements (opens in new tab) within Google, Amazon, and other tech giants, with employees speaking out in support of the Palestinian cause.\n\n“Today, the tide in tech has shifted,” Masad posted to X in September. (opens in new tab) “If you’ve been holding back, now is the time to speak out and call out anyone supporting or celebrating genocide.”\n\nWith Silicon Valley warming back up to him — he was on a16z’s podcast in October (opens in new tab) — Masad was invited to larger, and more controversial, audiences. He drove hours to record at Carlson’s rural Maine cabin, nodding politely when the host marveled on air at his perfect English. In July, he sat down with Rogan, talking about everything from Gaza to the Covid vaccine, which Masad has refused to take.\n\n“I tend to have a negative reaction to anyone forcing me to do something,” Masad said, prompting a “Good for you” from Rogan. “It was the same thing now with talking about Palestine and things like that. The more they come at me, the more I want to say things.”\n\nHe appears now to have the capital, both financially and socially, to draw hard lines. “There are a lot of people who care about the Palestinians but who are afraid to speak out publicly,” said Graham, who has also been an outspoken advocate for Palestine. “What Amjad and I have in common is that we don’t have to worry about being fired if we do.”\n\nMasad said Israel’s Ministry of Education had reached out around 2016 to work with Replit. “We got very close to a deal, but they were very overbearing,” he said, adding that the government had what he viewed as cumbersome requirements, like fining Replit if the service went down. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHe says he would never work with Israel now. “I think it’s an illegitimate and criminal government,” he told me during our gun safety training. “I mean, [Benjamin] Netanyahu is a war criminal.”\n\nWhen I pointed out that Saudi Arabia has its own abysmal human rights record, Masad drew a contrast.\n\n“I just think about how Replit is going to be used. Like, Israel is actively committing genocide and ethnic cleansing, and if you sell to the government there, it’s possible that they’re going to use it for that,” he said, pointing to the country’s use of Microsoft cloud services to track Palestinians’ phone calls. (After an investigation by The Guardian, Microsoft said it disabled the services that made the tracking possible in September. (opens in new tab))\n\nIt’s a careful, and conveniently self-serving, justification. This logic allows Replit to work with countries that Masad finds tolerable. Whether that line will hold as Replit scales is unclear.\n\nAfter the shooting range, we drove through a thick forest fog to the restaurant The Mountain House in Woodside. Over grilled venison, Masad talked about Replit’s next challenge: expanding its user base from corporate clients to everyday users. This isn’t essential — plenty of companies thrive selling enterprise software. But Masad wants Replit to be an engine for socioeconomic mobility around the world, letting anyone, anywhere, easily create apps and businesses.\n\nMasad acknowledged that if he succeeds — if Replit goes public and he becomes a billionaire — he will have the capital to make real change for Palestine, though he’s light on details. “It’s hard to plan for 20 years in the future,” he shrugged. “I just know that wealth is a prerequisite.”\n\nMargaux MacColl can be reached at [email protected]",

    "description": "I’m a software engineer and product maker based in Cracow, Poland. My mission is to create useful products by writing high-quality code and sharing my knowledge throughout the journey.",
    "fullText": "For the last couple of years, watching the software industry has been an emotional experience for me. And will I remember the winter of 2025/2026 - the time when apparently everyone and your mum discovered just how good in coding the Claude Opus 4.5 is - as the culmination of that period, and one of the hardest and most confusing times for me as a professional.\n\nOn one hand, there's anxiety. The pace of change is brutal. New tools appear every week, workflows emerge almost overnight. Wondering where this is all is heading, and whether there will still be a place for us on the other side.\n\nI felt strange hearing from industry thought leaders like Andrej Karpathy, saying that English is now the new programming language. I had spent years honing the craft of writing in programming languages - so what was I supposed to make of that, if it was now being treated as commoditized?\n\nAfter months of thinking about that, I had identified the feeling - grief. Grief for manual coding.\n\nFor years, my identity as an engineer was tightly coupled to the artifacts I produced. My repositories. My components. My abstractions. The code was mine, and that ownership mattered. It was craft and it was personal. Like a carpenter remembering how it felt to build a specific chair.\n\nThat mental model no longer holds for me. How could it, when everyone now can one-shot a todo app for themselves, just like a PowerPoint presentation?\n\nOn the other hand, there's excitement. I got into coding because I wanted to create worlds. Websites, apps, flows, solutions, interactions between users, beautiful and unique things.\n\nNow the ceiling of building is so high that we cannot even see it. Ideas that felt too expensive or too complex are suddenly within reach. It's not an understatement to say things that used to take weeks and months now may take hours. I'm not saying that it's easy to do it and everyone can make it happen, but it's certainly possible.\n\nThe new leverage comes from moving one layer up. Instead of doing every task ourselves, we design systems that can do them for us. A single agent can now execute autonomously what used to require long hours my time, freeing my attention for higher-level decisions, design, judgment. And maybe just... enjoying the life with my loved ones?\n\nThis all immensely increases the leverage of single engineer. Technically, you're one well designed system away from solving a daunting problem for the first time, from building life-changing startup, from building your dream game. Of course, it's still hard and rare, but pre-agentic coding it was often not possible at all - you had to broke the concrete walls of thousands of lines of code first.\n\nI mentioned that everyone with AI can one-shot a personal to-do app now. Engineers with AI can create much more that. They can design systems that scale, adapt, and solve problems in ways that were previously out of reach, everything under strict engineering discipline - secure, cheap and efficient.\n\nThat's why, overall, I am cautiously optimistic on what the future holds.\n\nAnd it seems like - as buzzwordy and cliché as it sounds - that the future is agentic.\n\nThe word agentic gets thrown around a lot, so it's worth grounding it. I will use the definition I personally In practice, the systems that actually work for me tend to follow the same five core steps:\n\nPoints 2, 4 ad 5 can be somewhat \"recursively\" executed by agents - it's not hard to imagine agents implementing the system by writing specs or veryfing the outputs for other agents.\n\nPoints 1 and 3 are uniquely human - we decide what we want to exist, and we trigger the execution process. And while point 3 - triggering the execution - also can be run by agent, I keep it in this category because someone is at the end is responsible for what the agents did, and in that sense it is uniquely human.\n\nThis shift doesn't mean the broad engineering skill is obsolete. It means where that skill applies has changed.\n\nTo orchestrate agents that produce valid code, I still need to understand:\n\nAnd what is even more important:\n\nInstead of applying that knowledge and intent manually in code, I encode it into the system that produces the code. It produces the code in indeterministic way, mind you, and potentially on much broader scale. We don't know yet which scale we talk about. 2x? 10x? Maybe more? We will see.\n\nAnd there's whole new class of problem to solve. How do I ensure models doesn't produce unexpected or harmful results? How do I coordinate several, dozen, and more models to work together? How do I ensure AI runs on prem and we don't share our precious data with anyone?\n\nIn other words, the craft moves up a level.\n\nInitially, I wanted to include \"the end of manual coding\" in this post's title. But I changed it to \"the future manual of coding\".\n\nFirst, I didn't want to sound clickbaity. Now, seriously - manual coding isn't gone. It still has a very important place. Best professionals always understood different abstraction levels, not only the highest one. Code is runtime, and you have to understand runtime through and through. Apart from that - it's still important in learning, personal work, and honing the cognitive skills. I especially believe in the last one, because delegating so much mental work we used to do before will take a tool on our thinking in a long term.\n\nBut it's no longer the default path to producing value and to economic leverage. The role of software engineers is shifting:\n\nWe're no longer producing artifacts (code). We're designing systems producing artifacts.\n\nOnce you accept that, a lot of confusion from the last couple of years disappears. The grief is still there, but it's quieter. And there is something else: the clarity, and a sense that this change, while uncomfortable, is also full of possibility.\n\nOne important note: no, all of this doesn't mean succumbing to AI slop. We're still responsible for everything our agents produce - every single line of it. And no, it doesn't mean letting AI write sloppy LinkedIn posts or Slack messages is suddenly acceptable. If anything, the opposite: write your damn words yourself, please. Do not delegate your thinking.\n\nThere's a whole lot of skill to designing the agentic systems including mastering specs engineering, enforcing constraints, output verification, model evaluation and so on. This is the obvious thing to focus on first.\n\nMany people dreamed of living in times with real blank spots on the map, to be able to discover the unknown themselves. Software engineers in 2026 have the privilege of experiencing this. And it can be a source of risk, as well as an economic leverage.\n\nWe've always been good at automating and learning new things. Now there's even more to automate and learn. Our focus should shift from manual coding to designing systems that produce code at scale - while remembering that manual coding got us here, and still matters, just for different reasons.\n\nI’m a software engineer and product maker based in Cracow, Poland. My mission is to create useful products by writing high-quality code and sharing my knowledge throughout the journey.",

    "fullText": "Two decades before US forces kidnapped Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro this weekend, Hugo Chávez had already predicted the approach:\n\nYears ago, someone told me: ‘They’re going to end up accusing you of being a drug trafficker – you personally – you, Chávez. Not just that the government supports it, or permits it – no, no, no. They’re going to try to apply the Noriega formula to you.’ They’re looking for a way to associate Chávez directly with drug trafficking. And then, anything goes against a ‘drug trafficker president’, right?\n\nOn the morning of 3 January, Trump tweeted a Happy New Year message. The US had carried out ‘a large scale strike on Venezuela and its leader’. President Maduro and his wife Cilia had been ‘captured and flown out of the Country’. Trump said more details would follow in a few hours’ time. The details, however, were confused.\n\nLater that day, an old friend from Caracas rang to say that secret negotiations had been taking place for some time between the regime and the Americans. The Americans wanted Maduro’s head, which he refused to supply – according to the New York Times, he was offered transport to a well-cushioned retirement in Turkey, which he scorned, to his great credit. And though repeatedly offering to negotiate with Washington on questions of oil and US drug imports, he was also rallying Venezuelans against Trump’s military build-up in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Trump administration evidently preferred negotiating with Delcy Rodríguez, the vice-president, and others in Venezuela, where the two key ministers are Diosdado Cabello at the Interior Ministry and Vladimir Padrino at Defence. Both have support in the Army, some 100,000 strong, and Cabello also commands the popular militia forces, which are said to be larger still. As Trump reinforced his threatening armada over the past few months, the Maduro government responded by arming sections of the population.\n\nThe question of who now governs Venezuela has therefore become crucial. The first answer came from Trump: ‘We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.’ But the Trump Administration is caught in a cleft stick. Trump’s MAGA base is not in favour of sending American troops to be killed in foreign countries – this was a central part of the campaign they waged against the Democrats and the old GOP establishment over Afghanistan and Iraq. They do not want US troops on the ground in Venezuela. At the same time, the hard-right Latino émigré ultras represented by Rubio are unhappy that Bolivarians are still in office in Caracas.\n\nThere was talk at one point that Marco Rubio might be appointed de facto governor or consul, to give orders to the Venezuelan government. Meanwhile, messages from Caracas have been mixed. The day after the capture of Maduro, Cabello declared:\n\nThis is an attack against Venezuela. We are in position. We call on our people to remain calm and to trust the leadership. Do not allow anyone to become discouraged or make the situation easier for the aggressive enemy.\n\nRodríguez, confirmed by the Venezuelan Supreme Court as interim president for the next three months, went on state TV to call for Maduro’s release. Trump attacked her in an interview with The Atlantic for not being sufficiently pliant, saying she made promises that must now be kept, and threatening: ‘If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.’ He went on: ‘Regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can’t get any worse.’\n\nThe Trump administration seems incapable of grasping that – whatever people think of Maduro – very few Venezuelans welcome an invasion of their country by the United States. This is a tradition that goes back to Simón Bolívar, who warned specifically that Latin America must beware the new empire to the north and resist exchanging Spanish for American domination. Since Sunday, there have been demonstrations in many different parts of the country demanding Maduro’s release, including a huge one in Caracas itself. The dismay goes well beyond the support base of the regime. A leading anti-Maduro Catholic leader, interviewed on BBC Radio 4 on 5 January, was told, ‘You must be very happy now’. He replied: ‘No, we are not happy. We don’t like our country being occupied, and the majority of Venezuelans don’t want it to be occupied.’\n\nAs Chávez warned, Trump and Rubio have been trying to fit up Maduro on ‘narco-terrorism’ charges, the latest iteration of those invisible weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. ‘Maduro is NOT the president of Venezuela’, Rubio tweeted last summer, ‘and his regime is NOT the legitimate government. Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States.’\n\nAs is well known, Rubio himself comes from a distinguished cocaine family, heavily implicated in the drug trade throughout South America. His relatives have been involved in smuggling cocaine into the United States for years. As Secretary of State, he has put drug dealers into every pro-US government on the continent. Unsurprisingly, some are saying that the assault could actually be a Rubio move to defend US-sponsored drug-runners against the more autonomous dealers who also exist in that part of the world.\n\nAnother irony is that Delta Force, the US state-terrorist special forces team that abducted the Venezuelan president, is itself widely regarded as operating a drug-trafficking network within the United States. The investigative journalist Seth Harp’s The Fort Bragg Cartel: Drug Trafficking and Murder in the Special Forces (2025) documents murder and narcotics trafficking committed in and around the US Army installation outside of Fayetteville, North Carolina. Harp’s book made it onto the New York Times bestseller list and reviewers have largely accepted its findings. So this criminal US operation was carried out by its own drug cartel. There’s no sense of shame here, or anything like that. They just do it, assuming people will keep on taking this as long as they can point to a few successes.\n\nWe now have Attorney General Pam Bondi tweeting the so-called indictments, which have a touch of insanity about them:\n\nNicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York. Nicolas Maduro has been charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States.\n\nNo serious lawyer in the United States could take this at face value. The whole thing is a farce. To accuse a sitting president, whom you’ve just kidnapped while bombing his capital, of ‘conspiracy to possess’ automatic weapons is grotesque. Bondi is setting up a show trial, but it may not be as easy as she thinks. Without any doubt, some of the best US lawyers will defend Maduro and take up his case. This does indicate, however, that appointments to the second Trump cabinet were largely made on the basis of loyalty rather than competence – selecting people who wouldn’t question the President and his crazy ideas – as the interview with Trump’s chief of staff in Vanity Fair makes clear. The absence of any serious opposition in the country capable of insisting on the authority of Congress suggests a process of decay within the institutions of American bourgeois democracy itself.\n\nMany have pointed out – as Chávez himself noted – that this is the Noriega script. But there is an important sense in which Maduro, whatever his weaknesses, cannot be compared to Noriega. The Panamanian strongman had effectively worked for the CIA since the 1950s, gunrunning for right-wing groups heavily involved in the drug trade, before he fell out with Washington. He had been trained in torture at the notorious School of the Americas, where countless racketeers and drug-trafficking money-launderers had their first experience of what was required of them. The US treated him extremely badly, despite everything he had done for them. He began to get one or two ideas about national sovereignty, at which point the government of George H. W. Bush angrily decided to oust him. That operation, however, was backed by a US military invasion, before a joint Delta-SEAL detachment lifted him from his palace and handed him over to US Marshals to be locked up after a fake trial.\n\nBut there is another precedent, which should not be forgotten: that of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, President of Haiti in the early 1990s and then again from his election in 2001 until his overthrow in 2004. Initially a moderate, Aristide had the nerve to say that Haiti should be repaid by France for the massive reparations the island had been forced to pay its former colonial master for the crime of abolishing slavery after the 1791–1804 Haitian Revolution – some $21 billion in today’s money. Paris worried that this might set a precedent for Algerian demands. In February 2004, French and Haitian officials collaborated with the US to force Aristide out of the country.\n\nThere’s an interesting footnote here. In spring 2004 I happened to be at a conference in Caracas when this Franco-American operation was taking place. The day after Aristide’s abduction, I said to Chávez: ‘Why didn’t you offer him asylum?’ He said: ‘I feel incredibly upset. He was trying to ring me, and we were busy with the conference. By the time I got the message, it was too late. He’d already been sent off to South Africa, and I regret it.’ I told him that I was going to Johannesburg soon to give a lecture. Chávez said: ‘Please try and meet him and tell him he’s very welcome here. He should be back in his own region to fight back against these rogues.’ I did, in fact, send the message. But I think Pretoria had a deal that he was to be kept in South Africa until the US allowed him to return to Haiti. Maduro is the latest in a long line.\n\nThe attacks against him recall the assaults on Chávez, continually accused by the Western media of being a dictator. Why? Because he wore a uniform. But Chávez was extremely popular and won election after election; one didn’t have to go down to the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia to find people infinitely worse on every level. Chávez’s radical-democratic constitution – including the right to recall the president by referendum, if necessary – was denounced by the right-wing opposition, even though it then tried to use the same recall mechanism against him. I was in Caracas when Jimmy Carter visited the country to observe the elections. He was shocked when, entering a restaurant in the leafy eastern suburbs of the city, where the bourgeoisie lives, the local opposition spat abuse at him. Afterwards he said, ‘I’ve never seen an opposition like this anywhere’. When asked, ‘How did you think the elections went?’, he answered that he hadn’t seen such a fair election in any country, clearly including the United States.\n\nChávez always insisted that the Bolivarian Revolution must be a democratic experience – and it was. Many people, including myself, discussed this with him. When the first results came in for the 2004 referendum, I asked Chávez, ‘Compañero, what are we going to do if we lose?’ He said, ‘What do you do if you lose? You leave office and fight again from outside, explaining why they were wrong’. He had a very strong sense of this. Which is why it’s a travesty to accuse the Chavistas of being anti-democratic from the start. During the Chávez period, the opposition newspapers and television stations blasted propaganda non-stop, attacking the regime – something you could never have seen in Britain or the United States. When people said to Chávez, ‘We should crack down’, he said, ‘No, we fight them politically’.\n\nSince 2013, the regime has been hollowed out. If Maduro won the 2024 election, he was not able to provide any proof of it when asked by Lula. Economically, there’s no doubt that the Bolivarians were ill-advised, even during the Chávez days. When the best Keynesian economists turned up there, including Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot, as well as Joseph Stiglitz, their recommendations weren’t followed. Possibly it would have been better at that point if they had turned to the Chinese. But the real economic deterioration was a result of the US siege. The sanctions on oil sales, imposed by Trump in 2017-18 and maintained by Biden, effectively led to some 7 million people leaving the country, with Venezuelan refugees turning up in Miami, Colombia and other parts of Latin America. Washington knew what it was doing.\n\nThe support of the Venezuelan armed forces also came at a cost. After the 2002 coup attempt against Chávez, I said to him, ‘This is your chance to go for a massive restructuring of the Army’. But he said, ‘It’s not easy to do. We’re getting rid of all the senior generals who knew of or were involved in the coup attempt against me’. So I said, ‘Well, that’s actually very generous of you, because had such a coup attempt been made against an elected government in the United States, it’s very likely that the top general would have been executed for treason and the other generals would have been locked up for years. But you’ve been very kind, you’ve let some of these guys go out.’ He said, ‘Better to have the smell away’. It was a weakness, I felt at the time.\n\nYet for a long period, the Bolivarian regime combined radical democracy, far-reaching social-welfare and literacy programmes and an internationalist foreign policy. That was the constellation. The Cuban contribution was very important, the misiones and the rest of it. But the Cubans had no lessons to teach on democracy, alas. As the economic siege tightened, Caracas abandoned virtually all the Chavista reforms, turning to dollarization and austerity from 2019. On foreign policy, however, they didn’t go that route. They have cut down a lot on the oil to Cuba as a result of US sanctions, but they haven’t abandoned Havana. They maintained a tough position on Gaza and the Middle East, which obviously annoys the Americans. As Washington has made clear, they want a Rubio–Trump government which is theirs, 100 per cent.\n\nAt the official level, international reaction has been predictably muted. Naturally, China, Russia and many other powers have condemned the US military attack and abduction, calling for Maduro and Flores’s immediate release. After some dithering the Europeans have rallied in support of their protector, albeit with a shade more ambivalence than they displayed in backing the Israeli genocide in Gaza. Macron initially put out a statement calling on Venezuelans to ‘rejoice’ at Maduro’s abduction, then had second thoughts and issued another saying that France ‘neither supported nor approved’ US methods, before characteristically putting out a third, looking forward to a peaceful transition to a Venezuela led by Edmundo González Urrutia. Merz judges the legality of the kidnapping to be ‘complex’. Starmer too has been evasive, mumbling about ‘support for international law’ while avoiding any criticism of Trump.\n\nDouble standards the citizens of Europe are used to. Russia on the one side, against whom the EU is preparing their twentieth package of sanctions; and Israel on the other, which maintains its status of favoured nation. And now there’s a third, triple standard – the attack on Venezuela. By comparison, the attitude of The New York Times is more forthright, calling the operation an instance of ‘latter-day imperialism’, representing ‘a dangerous and illegal approach to America’s place in the world.’ It cites Republican legislators who have spoken out against Trump’s course in Congress – Senators Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, Representatives Thomas Massie and Don Bacon.\n\nThere may be further mobilizations in the United States itself. The new mayor of New York, Zohran Mamdani, denounced the unilateral attack on a sovereign nation as an act of war, and there have already been protests in eight US cities. Solidarity with the Bolivarian Republic is crucial. At stake is not only the future of Venezuela but also that of the Cuban Revolution – the first, and alas it would appear last, socialist revolution in the Americas. Cuba has been battered and besieged by the United States: one invasion defeated at Playa Girón, constant sanctions, constant attacks, constant lies. Without Venezuelan oil, supplied free since the Bolivarians came to power, there is reason to fear for Cuba’s future. And if the US succeeds in ‘cleaning up’ Venezuela, Cuba may well be next.\n\nBut this may prove harder than expected. The demonstrations in Caracas should serve as a warning to the Trump administration. Over the last few days, Rodríguez has been alternating between militant speeches, attacking what has happened, and reassuring noises to the Americans. Trump is saying, ‘We’re not interested in what she says, we’re interested in what she does’. He’s right. A lot will depend, not so much on her, because she’s just a figurehead, but on the Venezuelan Army, which is absolutely crucial.\n\nThe Trump administration could be faced with a dilemma. The Bolivarians still control the Venezuelan military and paramilitary forces, the courts, the oil industry and every level of the administrative bureaucracy. Emotions are running high, as the message delivered to the Venezuelan National Assembly by Maduro’s son made clear. The Rodríguez government has been negotiating, as we know. But if Trump and Rubio ramp up the pressure too far, given the general hostility to the US attack, Caracas may be forced into some show of resistance. If Rodríguez and company refuse to play ball at some point, Trump might be capable of shrugging it off, but the Rubio camp will not be. At that stage, the logic of treating Caracas as a puppet government could break down and the line will be, ‘Okay, they’re traitors, let’s go and grab them’ – finally sending in boots on the ground. That would get messy, fast. It would also cause enormous tensions within Trump’s own camp, because this is one thing he repeatedly pledged not to do.\n\nIn Chávez’s 2005 speech, he went on to say:\n\nFidel once told me, ‘Chávez, if that ever happens to you or me, if they invade us, the last thing we’d do is what Saddam did: go and hide in a hole. You have to die fighting, in the first line of battle.’ And that’s what I would do – if I have to die, I’ll die on the front line with the dignity of a Venezuelan who loves this country.\n\nRead on: Julia Buxton ‘Venezuela After Chávez’, NLR 99.",

    "fullText": "Sample of roughly 500 posts shows how frequently people are creating sexualized images with Elon Musk’s AI chatbot\n\nNew research that samples X users prompting Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok demonstrates how frequently people are creating sexualized images with it. Nearly three-quarters of posts collected and analyzed by a PhD researcher at Dublin’s Trinity College were requests for nonconsensual images of real women or minors with items of clothing removed or added.\n\nThe posts offer a new level of detail on how the images are generated and shared on X, with users coaching one another on prompts; suggesting iterations on Grok’s presentations of women in lingerie or swimsuits, or with areas of their body covered in semen; and asking Grok to remove outer clothing in replies to posts containing self-portraits by female users.\n\nAmong hundreds of posts identified by Nana Nwachukwu as direct, nonconsensual requests for Grok to remove or replace clothing, dozens reviewed by the Guardian show users posting pictures of women including celebrities, models, stock photos and women who are not public figures posing in snapshots.\n\nSeveral posts in the trove reviewed by the Guardian have received tens of thousands of impressions and come from premium, “blue check” accounts, including accounts with tens of thousands of followers. Premium accounts with more than 500 followers and 5m impressions over three months are eligible for revenue-sharing under X’s eligibility rules.\n\nIn one Christmas Day post, an account with more than 93,000 followers presented side-by-side images of an unknown woman’s backside with the caption: “Told Grok to make her butt even bigger and switch leopard print to USA print. 2nd pic I just told it to add cum on her ass lmao.”\n\nA 3 January post, representative of dozens reviewed by the Guardian, captioned an apparent holiday snap of an unknown woman: “@grok replace give her a dental floss bikini.” Within two minutes, Grok provided a photorealistic image that satisfied the request. Other posts in the trove show more sophisticated employment of JSON-prompt engineering to induce Grok to generate novel sexualized images of fictitious women.\n\nThe data does not cover all such requests made to Grok. While content analysis firm Copyleaks reported on 31 December that X users were generating “roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute”, Nwachukwu said that her sample is limited to just more than 500 posts she was able to collect with X’s API via a developer account. She said that the true scale “could be thousands, it could be hundreds of thousands” but that changes made by Musk to the API mean that “it is much harder to see what is happening” on the platform. On Wednesday, Bloomberg News cited researchers who found that Grok users were generating up to 6,700 undressed images per hour.\n\nNwachukwu, an expert on AI governance and a longtime observer of and participant in social media safety initiatives, said that she first noticed requests along these lines from X users back in 2023.\n\nAt the time, she said, “Grok did not oblige the requests. It wasn’t really good at doing those things.” The bot’s responses began changing in 2024, and reached a critical mass late last year.\n\nIn October 2025, she noticed that “people were putting Halloween attire on themselves using Grok. Of course, a section of users realized we can also ask it to change what other people are wearing.” By year’s end, “there was a huge uptick in people asking Grok to put different people in bikinis or other types of suggestive clothing”.\n\nThere were other indications last year of an increased willingness to tolerate or even encourage the generation of sexually suggestive material with Grok.\n\nIn August, xAI incorporated a “spicy mode” setting in the mobile version of Grok’s text-to-video generation tool, leading the Verge to characterize it as “a service designed specifically to make suggestive videos”.\n\nNwachukwu’s data is just the latest indication of how the platform under Musk has become a magnet for forms of content that other platforms work to exclude, including hate speech, gore content and copyrighted material.\n\nOn Friday, Grok issued a bizarre public apology over the incident on X, claiming that “xAI is implementing stronger safeguards to prevent this”. On Tuesday, X Safety posted a promise to ban users who shared child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Musk himself said: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”\n\nNwachukwu said, however, that posts like those she has already collected are still appearing on the platform. Musk is giving “the middle finger to everyone who has asked for the platform to be moderated”, she said. The billionaire slashed Twitter’s trust and safety teams when he took over in 2022.\n\nShe added that other AI chatbots do not have the same issues.\n\n“Other generative AI platforms – ChatGPT or Gemini – they have safeguards,” she said. “If you ask them to generate something that looks like a person, it would never be a depiction of that person. They don’t generate depictions of real human beings.”\n\nThe revelations about the nonconsensual imagery on X has already drawn the attention of regulators in the UK, Europe, India, and Australia.\n\nNwachukwu, who is from Nigeria, pointed to a specific harm being done in the posts to “women from conservative societies”.\n\n“There’s a lot of targeting of people from conservative beliefs, conservative societies: west Africa, south Asia. This represents a different kind of harm for them,” she said.",

    "title": "7 Flooring Trends Set to Take Over in 2026, According to Experts",
    "description": "Flooring projects are no small feat, but with expert advice, you can pull off one or more of this year's trends.",
    "fullText": "Not only is flooring for your home a significant investment, but it's also a permanent fixture that affects the overall look, comfort level, and feel of the space. Whether you're planning a home renovation or you're building a house from the ground up, getting the flooring right is essential.\n\nTo help you make the right choice, we tapped flooring industry experts who share what materials, styles, and color palettes will be hot this year. Here are the seven flooring trends the pros say are about to be everywhere.\n\nHannes Boman is the head of design at Bjelin, a wood flooring company based in Sweden.\n\nMisael Tagle is the chief executive officer (CEO) and founder of Duchateau, a flooring manufacturer based in San Diego, CA.\n\nAnthony Scott is the global product and innovation director at Havwoods, a wood flooring company based in Britain.\n\nMaria O’Brien is the vice president of design at Ruggable, a rug retailer based in Gardena, CA.\n\nWood flooring will be making a shift toward warmer tones and more traditional styles throughout 2026. \"Warm neutrals and natural tones are leading the palette, with soft honeyed hues, mid-oak finishes, and muted browns replacing cooler grays,\" says Anthony Scott, global product and innovation director at Havwoods. Scott says these tones work beautifully across both flooring and wall surfaces, and create seamless, layered interiors that feel grounded and connected to nature.\n\nHannes Boman, head of design at Bjelin, agrees. \"Rich browns, soft beiges, and the natural hues of raw wood will become more popular as homeowners and designers seek to bring a sense of nature-inspired comfort and 'homeliness' into interiors.\"\n\nPatterned wood flooring is a trend that experts say will remain strong as we head into 2026. \"Designs like herringbone and chevron offer dynamic visual interest and can dramatically influence how a space feels,\" Boman says.\n\nBoman shares that these patterns introduce a sense of rhythm and movement, while variations in scale have the ability to transform a room's mood: \"Larger patterns lend calm and balance, while tighter layouts add energy and texture,\" Boman explains.\n\n\"Herringbone patterns will have a strong presence, especially in creative variations like double herringbone,\" Misael Tagle, CEO and founder of Duchateau, adds. Tagle notes these layouts showcase craftsmanship and express design intent, creating a bespoke feel.\n\nWhen it comes to rugs that will be trending next year, it looks like 2026 will be all about cozy comfort. “Soft-touch, plush rugs are becoming more popular as consumers search for cozy and comforting tactility in their homes,\" says Maria O’Brien, VP of design at Ruggable. She notes that high-pile rugs with soft, underfoot comfort add warmth and coziness to both shared and intimate spaces, and predicts that they will continue to play a key role in creating inviting interiors. O'Brien also highlights the importance of practicality. \"Easy care and performance rugs will continue to be important for consumers as their lifestyles are increasingly busy and time-stretched,\" she says.\n\nWhen it comes to upcoming rug design trends, O'Brien says there are several. \"Bold, playful brights in geometric patterns and color blocking continue to be trending interior aesthetics,\" she shares. If you prefer a more understated look, O’Brien shares another trend that's gaining momentum for 2026: \"The resurgence of softer colors in nostalgic hues that complement gentle, timeless patterns and capture the essence of slow living.”\n\n“As we move into 2026, wood in all its forms, flooring, paneling, and bespoke detailing, is taking center stage in interior design,\" Scott says. He shares there's a continued shift toward natural materials and craftsmanship, where wood becomes both a functional foundation and a statement of artistry. \"Clients are increasingly looking for solutions that combine sustainability, texture, and warmth, bringing a sense of calm and sophistication into their spaces,\" Scott says. He shares that in high-end projects, he's also seeing a renewed focus on custom woodwork—like fluted wall panels and architectural detailing—that adds depth and individuality to every design.\n\nWide plank flooring is timeless, according to Tagle, and will continue to make an appearance in 2026. \"It’s more than a trend, it’s a foundation of design,\" Tagle says. The expert explains that the generous scale of longer and wider planks visually elongates a room, enhancing light and proportion while also grounding a space with natural authenticity. Boman adds that long, wide planks arranged symmetrically create order and tranquility, which makes them especially well-suited for bedrooms and other spaces that are designed for rest and reflection.\n\nIt's not just materials and tones that are driving flooring trends. Scott says texture and dimension will be key in 2026. \"Designers are leaning into tactile finishes and brushed grains to create movement and character, while fire-compliant and sustainable options are becoming essential for larger commercial and hospitality projects.\"\n\nSustainability and easy maintenance are two important factors impacting flooring material selection. \"Flooring that combines long-term durability with low-maintenance care will remain highly desirable,\" Boman says. The expert shares that advances in surface protection that preserve a natural, \"low-gloss, oiled aesthetic\" will also gain traction, as they simultaneously offer both beauty and practicality.",

    "fullText": "Judge says there is plenty of evidence to suggest OpenAI’s leaders made assurances nonprofit structure would be kept\n\nElon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI is to go to trial after a US judge said there is plenty of evidence to support the billionaire’s case.\n\nThe world’s richest man, who co-founded OpenAI, is suing the ChatGPT developer and its chief executive, Sam Altman, over claims its leaders violated the organisation’s founding mission by shifting to a for-profit model.\n\nThe US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, told a hearing there was plenty of evidence that suggested OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure was going to be maintained.\n\nShe said there were enough disputed facts to let a jury consider the claims at a trial scheduled for March, rather than decide the issues herself. Rogers said she would issue a written order after the hearing that addresses OpenAI’s attempt to throw out the case.\n\nThe court dispute comes amid a broader showdown over dominance in the market for generative artificial intelligence. Musk’s xAI and its chatbot Grok are competing with OpenAI and other technology developers.\n\nMusk is seeking unspecified monetary damages from what he calls “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI.\n\nIn a statement after the hearing, OpenAI said: “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.”\n\nMusk’s startup xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSteven Molo, a lead trial attorney for the billionaire and xAI, said after the hearing: “We look forward to presenting all the evidence of the defendants’ wrongdoing to the jury.”\n\nMusk contends he contributed about $38m (£28m), roughly 60% of OpenAI’s early funding, along with strategic guidance and credibility, based on assurances that the organisation would remain a nonprofit dedicated to the public benefit.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman of plotting a for-profit switch to enrich themselves, culminating in multibillion-dollar deals with Microsoft and a recent restructuring.\n\nOpenAI, Altman and Brockman have denied the claims, and have described Musk as “a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader”.\n\nMicrosoft, which is also a defendant, urged Rogers to throw out Musk’s claims against it. A lawyer for Microsoft said there was no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has been approached for comment.\n\nLawyers for OpenAI at the hearing asked Rogers to enter judgment against Musk, contending that he had not shown enough of a factual basis to sustain his allegations including fraud and breach of contract.\n\nOpenAI also contends that Musk failed to bring his allegations in a timely manner. The judge said the jury would be asked to weigh whether the lawsuit was filed outside the statute of limitations.",

    "fullText": "Research finds growing trend of employers letting employees work remotely to free up more holiday time\n\nKatherine first caught the bug when she visited Australia a couple of years ago. The flights were expensive, and it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, so she asked her manager if she could extend the trip by two weeks, and work remotely from her friend’s house.\n\nThat was her first taste of a “workation” – combining working with a holiday – and she loved it. She now regularly arranges petsitting in different places so she can visit family, friends and new cities for long weekends without spending extra.\n\n“I just think it’s brilliant for work-life balance. It’s a great way to have a change of scene – your evenings and weekends, you feel like you’re on a mini-holiday,” she said. “It’s just getting out in nature, a different perspective, different environment.”\n\nAt 48, Katherine doesn’t fit the stereotype of a young digital nomad living a freewheeling life. But she’s one of a growing number of people of all ages who are taking advantage of digital technologies and increasing flexibility from employers to explore new ways of making the most of their free time.\n\nAs a conference manager at a university, she needs to be in her hometown when she’s organising an event, but otherwise she can work anywhere where she can take a laptop. Her employer doesn’t have a formal policy, but managers will consider all requests.\n\n“It all comes down to individual relationships and trust, and having that autonomy – I know my deadlines, my role and what I need to get done; that doesn’t change if I’m at home or elsewhere,” she said.\n\nResearch from the Chartered Management Institute found that one in eight employers have a formal policy on workations, while one in five managers said they had taken one themselves. Most perceived them positively, citing benefits such as mental health and work-life balance, though some feared data security implications.\n\nPetra Wilton, director of policy and external affairs at the CMI, recommended that employers should “put clear, transparent rules in place and actively manage them” to give managers the confidence to be supportive.\n\nA recent Grant Thornton survey suggests the use of formal arrangements is growing, with the number of businesses with a workations policy increasing from 59% in 2023 to 77% in 2025. A YouGov poll found that 37% of people able to work remotely were interested in taking a workation in the next 12 months.\n\nTravel companies are also targeting these holidaymakers – for example Tui has a workation page advertising “handpicked hotels that are perfect for a working holiday”.\n\nThis reflects a shift in people’s priorities from work-life balance towards “work-life blending”, where the boundaries between life and work are more blurred, said Daniel Wheatley, a researcher in the University of Birmingham’s management department.\n\nHe added that “workation” was a comparatively new term in academic circles that arose out of the cultural changes brought about by the Covid pandemic, advances in digital technologies since the 1990s, and travel, holidays and leisure pursuits going mainstream in the late 1970s.\n\nThe term reflects a growing culture of “life first, work second”, especially among younger employees, who are “exploring different ways of engaging in work, different forms and structures of careers rather than a linear pathway”, he said.\n\nBut rather than being a new way of working, the growth of knowledge and service work could actually herald a full circle return to the medieval era of artisans and craftspeople living in the same place as their workshops, he added.\n\n“It gives a sense of freedom and allows people to take more control over lives,” he said, noting that it could also help people juggle caring responsibilities.\n\nHowever, he underscored the importance of proper breaks from work, so that workations are about “leisure time, social connectedness and wider wellbeing”, rather than “increased monitoring meaning [employees] never feel offline or disconnected”.\n\nEqually, access to perks such as workations risked entrenching division in society between people who have benefited from digital technologies and those who have not, in particular those who experience digital or labour market exclusion and precarity.\n\nIan Brown, 58, a managing director for an industrial engineering company, has taken several workations to extend his holiday allowance after working from a beach hut in Jamaica, and now extends the perk to his employees.\n\n“It does feel ultimately that you’ve got more time away from the office space than normal – it takes you out of that environment, you’re away and doing something you enjoy. It refreshes you and gives you an added perk,” he said.\n\nHe feels that flexibility helps him accept the more onerous aspects of his job, such as 60-hour weeks and out-of-hours work, and fosters a culture of trust and reciprocity with employees. “They remember that when you’re up against it and ask them for help.”\n\nHe added: “The drawback I feared was that they would take the workation and not respond to requests to do something – that’s never happened – and the positivity is extraordinary.”",

    "title": "‘Jeopardy!’ Host Ken Jennings Makes Bold Political Statement — Fans React",
    "description": "The 'Jeopardy!' host took a strong stand on social.",
    "fullText": "Jeopardy! host Ken Jennings usually has a lot to say when it comes to correct answers, but when it comes to the political realm, he tends to draw a firm line between the game show podium and public debate.\n\nHowever, over on Bluesky social, Jennings had quite a bit to post about America’s current political climate.\n\n“America is always like ‘ok, but the NEXT regime change will work,’ like when I ‘cut out carbs’ briefly every January,” wrote Jennings on January 6. Then on January 7, he posted: “The ‘prosecute the former regime at every level’ candidate has my vote in 2028.”\n\nUsing sarcasm and dark humor to comment on American political cycles rather than endorsing a specific party or candidate, Jennings compared U.S. political optimism to a failed New Year’s resolution as Americans repeatedly believe the next political reset, revolution, or leadership overhaul will finally fix systemic problems.\n\nHis second post reinforced his frustration with the government’s lack of accountability.\n\nHe then proceeded to post, “It’s been a dark week, but I just saw someone reply to an ‘Abolish ICE’ post with a scoldy Bluesky ‘Uh, try abolish DHS’ and that joy will sustain me for a little while.”\n\nThis came in response to news that an ICE agent shot and killed a Minneapolis woman, reportedly named Renee Nicole Good and a U.S. citizen, in her car on a neighborhood street in the city, a story which the game show host reposted to his account earlier that day. According to USA Today, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the woman was not the “target of any law enforcement investigation or activity.”\n\nFans flocked to respond to the Jeopardy! host with mixed reactions, ranging from support and agreement to criticism and concern.\n\n“Please run, Ken. I’ll be your comedic vice-president,” wrote comedian Andy Kindler, to which Jennings replied, “Line of succession is Ken Jennings, Andy Kindler, and a third thing.”\n\n“I’ll take ‘history repeating itself’ for $300, Ken,” a fan responded.\n\n“What is [the] best take of 2026 thus far?” responded another.\n\nWriter and comedian Bill Corbett replied to Jenning’s ICE comment with, “Pedantry is a light in dark times,” to which the Jeopardy! host replied, “You forgot the capital letter and the period! Do better!” His response in turn was, “Ken, this is my promise to you: I will never do better.”\n\nAt the end of the day, Jennings wrote a post regarding the responses he received to his declarations, particularly the ones that made light of his remarks by using his occupation against him. With that, he wrote, “I’ve been a-blockin’ and a-mutin’ all afternoon, but I want everyone to know that I never block for this reply, though the universe gives me multiple opportunities every day. Many would block, but I have the patience of a saint. Go in peace, little one.”\n\nJeopardy!, weekdays, check local listings, stream next day on Hulu and Peacock\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "description": "What's the best age to claim Social Security benefits? There's actually a clear answer that's the right choice for most.",
    "fullText": "You can claim Social Security between 62 and 70.\n\nIf you take benefits before your full retirement age (FRA), they're reduced by as much as 30%.\n\nMaking the right choices on your Social Security benefits could help you have a more secure retirement.\n\nThe $23,760 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook ›\n\nWhen should you claim Social Security? That's the million-dollar question for most retirees.\n\nSince many people need their Social Security payments to help make ends meet, it makes sense to try to get as much money from the retirement benefit program as you can. Your claiming choice affects how much money you end up with each month and over time, so it's a very important decision.\n\nThe good news is, there's some pretty clear data telling you when the right time is for most people.\n\nThe first thing to know is when exactly you can claim Social Security. Here are the rules:\n\nYou can claim Social Security any time between 62 and 70 (you technically can claim later, but there's no benefit to doing so).\n\nIf you claim before your full retirement age, benefits shrink by as much as 30% from your standard benefit.\n\nIf you claim after FRA, benefits increase by as much as 24% compared to your standard benefit.\n\nSo an early claim means you get more payments over your lifetime. A later claim means you get fewer payments, but each one is larger.\n\nIn theory, it shouldn't matter when you claim Social Security. The early filing penalties and delayed retirement credits that increase or decrease your benefit were supposed to result in retirees getting the same amount of income, whether they claimed early or late.\n\nThat's no longer the case, though. Most people live longer than the life expectancies that actuaries considered when the system was created. It's now clear that the majority of retirees get more money if they wait -- ideally until 70 before getting their first check.\n\nThere have been multiple studies showing when to claim Social Security if you want to maximize your chances of getting the most benefits for life.\n\n57% of retirees generate more wealth by claiming at 70, while just 6.5% get more lifetime wealth when claiming before 64, according to a United Income study from 2019. Early \"suboptimal\" claims have resulted in retirees missing $111,000 per household in lifetime wealth.\n\n90% of workers aged 45 to 62 would generate more wealth with a claim at 70, with delayed claiming offering a 10.4% increase in lifetime spending for the typical worker, and a $182,370 increase in median household wealth, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.",

    "description": "There was likely a familial relation between two of the fallen warriors—father and son—but the third body’s tie to the two was more unclear.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAmateur archaeologists in Hungary discovered three 1,100-year-old burials of a trio of warriors.\n\nTwo of the warriors were teenagers at the time of their death and a third was likely the father of the youngest warrior.\n\nA range of high-status grave goods was discovered with the burials, including silver, gold, and weapons.\n\nVolunteer archaeologists in Hungary discovered the 1,100-year-old bodies of a trio of warriors—along with not only some unique familial ties among the deceased, but also plenty of elite-level artifacts with gold, silver, and ancient weaponry.\n\nDiscovered outside of Akasztó in Hungary, over 55 miles from Budapest, the three warriors’ graves were dated to the 920s or 930s C.E., a key moment in the Hungarian conquest. Located by volunteers from the Kecskemét Soldier József Museum’s community archaeology program, the bodies were found during an excavation led by archaeologists with the museum.\n\nThe first grave belonged to a warrior who was between 17 and 18 years old at the time of his death, according to a translated statement from the Pulszky Society Hungarian Museum Association. He was certainly part of an elite class, as the grave goods included a silver tarsoly plate, one of only about 30 that have been found in the Carpathian Basin.\n\nThe plate was enough to indicate an elite status for the teenage warrior, but the grave also contained a gold ring set with blue glass stones still on the deceased’s left hand, two gold hoops in his hair, and decorative silver arm and leg rings. The grave itself featured silk, leather, and wooden elements that the experts hope to continue to analyze.\n\nThe warrior’s horse had an interesting final rite as well. The animal—at least the head, legs, and hide—were included in the burial alongside a gilded silver harness. Experts, though, believe the rest of the horse was eaten during the funeral rites or at least burned during the event.\n\nThe museum officials called it “great fortune” the tomb was not robbed, as it is one of the “richest burials in the Tisza region.”\n\nA second tomb held an even younger warrior, likely just 15 or 16 years old. His grave included a bow and a quiver with seven arrows, according to Live Science. Decorative antler plates highlighted the bow handles.\n\nThe third grave featured archery equipment as well, alongside a 10th-century saber. Experts believe the warrior in the third grave was between 30 and 35 years old and likely the father of the youngest warrior, although they believe all three were probably related in some way. The older warrior also had a silver bracelet and a coin-adorned horse harness. In all, the archaeologists uncovered 81 coins, mostly from northern Italy, which the warriors could have obtained while fighting there.\n\nThe museum’s experts said that while all three were likely connected genetically, they may have also been connected through battle, and the father-son duo may have been the first warrior’s bodyguards.\n\nEarly analysis of all three bodies showed they enjoyed a diet high in animal proteins, but there were no clues as to the cause of death of the warrior trio.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "What's the CIA hiding?",
    "fullText": "Ever since it was first spotted hurtling through the solar system, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has maintained that there’s a chance mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a technological object sent by an extraterrestrial civilization.\n\nHe’s meticulously catalogued what he claims are anomalous qualities of the object, which most of his peers believe is a natural comet from a different star system, from its unusually large suspected size to a rotation axis almost perfectly perpendicular to the Sun to a “fine-tuned” trajectory that brought it within spitting distance of Mars and Jupiter.\n\nLoeb has also been angered at NASA’s continued insistence that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet — which, again, is the opinion of most experts — accusing them of “arrogance” and ignoring his documented anomalies. He also accused NASA of withholding observations by its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter while 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Red Planet in October, due to last year’s government shutdown. (The images were eventually released in late November.)\n\nNASA isn’t the government institution that Loeb is taking aim at. In a new blog post, the astronomer pointed out that ufologist John Greenewald Jr.’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiry for “any assessments, reports, or communications maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency referencing 3I/ATLAS” had been pointedly shut down.\n\nThe CIA told Greenewald in a formal response to his FOIA that it will “neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records” related to the object — a non-answer that could be interpreted in strikingly different ways.\n\nGreenewald is a well-known name in UFO circles. He founded The Black Vault, an enormous archive of millions of pages of government documents he’s uncovered via FOIA inquiries, including declassified videos of what the Pentagon describes as unidentified anomalous phenomena.\n\nLoeb says he found the answer — and the notable level of secrecy — “surprising,” given NASA’s conclusion that “3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin.”\n\n“If this conclusion was clear all along to everyone within government and academia — as NASA officials presented the case, then why would the CIA treat the possible existence of records dealing with a natural comet as sensitive enough to be classified?” he asked rhetorically.\n\nLoeb suggested the government might have investigated whether 3I/ATLAS could pose a threat to national security, perhaps over the possibility of a “black swan event,” which has fascinated the researcher.\n\nIf scientists do eventually uncover a probe sent to us by an alien civilization, it could pose a major threat to humanity, Loeb has asserted. He has previously hypothesized that the object could be “akin to a Trojan Horse, where a technological object masquerades as a natural comet.”\n\nDiscussions about such a possibility may have been “hidden from public view in order to prevent panic from taking hold for no good reason,” Loeb pondered, especially considering a “black swan event is still regarded as highly unlikely.”\n\nHowever, this theory presupposes that the CIA even has anything to hide from the public to begin with. After all, in its statement to Greenewald, it didn’t rule out the “nonexistence of records.”\n\nBesides, as more data rolls in, Loeb’s far-fetched theory that 3I/ATLAS is a piece of technology continues to be challenged.\n\nIn other words, what would there even to hide if the object does turn out to be a non-threatening lump of ice?\n\nEither way, Loeb isn’t ready to call it just yet. He has advocated for taking a closer look once it makes its closest approach to Jupiter in March.\n\n“Unless we check, we might never know if this swan is white or black,” he concluded in his blog.\n\nMore on 3I/ATLAS: Scientists Announce Results After Scanning 3I/ATLAS for Alien Signals",

    "fullText": "The lightning U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro can be seen as both a benefit and a burden for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces botched an attempt to capture Ukraine’s capital and topple its leader at the start of Moscow's invasion nearly four years ago.\n\nThe ouster of Maduro highlights another Kremlin failure to support an ally, following the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024 and last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran. With the U.S. determined to establish control over Venezuela, Russia stands to lose a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere, along with billions of dollars invested in its oil industry.\n\nBut President Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela also are causing unease in Western nations and giving the Kremlin fresh talking points to defend its war in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition, Trump’s interest in wresting control of Greenland from NATO ally Denmark also threatens to destabilize the alliance at the moment when the U.S.-led efforts to broker peace in Ukraine enter a pivotal stage, distracting its members from their efforts to support Kyiv and provide it with security guarantees.\n\nPutin himself hasn’t commented on the U.S. actions in Venezuela, which his diplomats have denounced as a blatant act of aggression. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president who serves as his deputy on the presidential Security Council, similarly rebuked Washington for trampling international law — but also complimented Trump on defending U.S. interests.\n\n“Even though Trump’s action is completely unlawful, he cannot be denied a certain consistency — he and his team are very aggressively upholding their country’s national interests,” Medvedev said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. said it seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela, including one flagged to Russia in the North Atlantic.\n\nMoscow's ‘spheres of influence’\n\nSince 2014's illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that followed the ouster of a pro-Kremlin president in Kyiv, Putin has sought to justify his action by describing his neighbor as part of Russia’s sphere of influence where Western encroachment can’t be allowed.\n\nPutin has argued that just as the U.S. would bristle at any foreign military presence in the Western Hemisphere, Russia sees NATO’s expansion to its borders as a major security threat. He cited Ukraine’s bid to join the military alliance as a key reason behind his full-scale invasion of the country.\n\n“We have made it clear and unambiguous that further eastward expansion of NATO is unacceptable,” Putin said shortly before sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. “Are we the ones placing missiles near the U.S. borders? No, it’s the U.S. that has brought its missiles to our doorstep.”\n\nLong before the invasion, Russia tested the ground on a possible deal under which it would refrain from meddling in Latin America in exchange for the U.S. offering Moscow free rein in Europe.\n\nFiona Hill, who oversaw Russia and Europe on Trump's National Security Council during his first term, testified before Congress in 2019 that the Russians were signaling their willingness to make such an arrangement involving Venezuela and Ukraine.\n\nRussia never made a formal offer, Hill told The Associated Press in an interview, but Moscow’s then-ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, “hinted ... many times” to her that Russia could cede its influence in Venezuela to the U.S. in exchange for a sphere of influence in Europe.\n\nShe said Trump's administration wasn’t interested in the Russian overtures that she described as a “hint-hint, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, how-about-doing-a-deal” offer. In April 2019, Hill was sent to Moscow to convey the message that “nobody’s interested. ... Ukraine and Venezuela are not related to each other.”\n\nHill said she did not know if the winds have now changed and whether there was any deal between the U.S. and Russia to swap spheres of influence in Venezuela and Ukraine, but she noted that many officials, including herself, who were involved in “restraining” Trump in his first term aren't around for his second.\n\nShe argued that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio would likely be the only member of the Trump administration who would now resist such a proposal, but added that others, including Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, could have a different view.\n\n“Who knows what Witkoff and others have been chatting about recently?” Hill asked.\n\nBefore Maduro was captured, AP reported Russia had started evacuating families of diplomats from Venezuela. When asked about the move, Hill said it would not be “implausible” that Witkoff gave Moscow a “courtesy heads-up.”\n\nSam Greene, a Russia expert at King’s College London, observed that Moscow may have backed down on Venezuela in the expectation of the U.S. giving it a free hand on Ukraine.\n\n“My worry is that it may be part of a tacit agreement, by which Washington, Moscow and Beijing agree not to deter one another against interventions in their putative spheres of influence,” he wrote on X.\n\nRussia’s foothold in Western Hemisphere\n\nBefore the invasion of Ukraine, senior Russian officials had issued vague warnings that Moscow could deploy troops or military assets to Cuba and Venezuela — statements that the U.S. dismissed as bluster. Some drew parallels to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis — when the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval blockade of the island.\n\nRussian-Cuban ties withered after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, plunging Cuba into a grueling depression. Soon after his first election in 2000, Putin ordered the closure of a Soviet-built military surveillance facility in Cuba as he sought to improve ties with Washington. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies mounted, however, Moscow again intensified trade and other contacts with Cuba and sent warships to visit the island.\n\nRussia also has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry, as did China, and offered Caracas generous loans to purchase top-of-the-line air defense missiles, fighter jets and other weapons. On several occasions, most recently in 2018, it dispatched its nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela in a projection of force.\n\nMilitary experts have said, however, that any attempt by Russia to establish a permanent military foothold in the Western Hemisphere would face overwhelming logistical challenges.\n\nThe ‘might-makes-right’ doctrine\n\nThe U.S. seizure of Maduro and his wife was seen worldwide as the return of the “might- makes-right” doctrine, backing Moscow’s argument that its action in Ukraine protects its vital interests the way the U.S. did in Venezuela.\n\nAfter its action in Venezuela, the U.S. has “nothing to formally reproach our country for,” Medvedev noted.\n\nHill noted that Maduro’s capture makes it harder for countries to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine because “we’ve just had a situation where the U.S. has taken over — or at least decapitated the government of another country — using fiction.”\n\nAn indictment accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S.\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, a Kremlin-connected, Moscow-based foreign policy expert, observed that “if we consider what’s happening from the perspective of setting a precedent, then we couldn’t ask for anything better, and this includes Trump’s conviction that the authorities in Venezuela must be approved by Washington.”\n\nRussian hawks, meanwhile, argue the U.S. action in Venezuela has created a new sense of urgency for Moscow to dramatically speed up its offensive in Ukraine.\n\n“Ukraine under our full control is our pass to the Great Powers club,” Alexander Dugin, a hard-line nationalist ideologue, wrote in a commentary.\n\nAP European Security Correspondent Emma Burrows in London contributed.",

    "fullText": "on January 8, 2026 at 6:36AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nAt the start of the year, you can always rely on the Consumer Electronics Show to be a hub for exciting innovations, bold prototypes, and downright weird ideas that aim to make life more convenient. While CES 2026 is (predictably) being dominated by AI shoehorned into various products this week, the show still has a few surprises up its sleeve. Between iterative gaming laptop upgrades for 2026 and flashy new OLED TVs, the event is also serving as a hub for interesting and weird technology.\n\nSome of this gear--like Razer's holographic AI companion tube--is already scheduled to be released later this year, while more experimental stuff, like brain-scanning headphones, are still a long way from being seen on store shelves. In case you couldn't make it to Las Vegas this year, here's a quick look at the technology that caught our eyes.\n\nAsus and XReal have teamed up for a new set of extended reality glasses, and on paper, these have some seriously impressive tech inside. Scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses and a dock that lets you connect them to a console or PC via HDMI and DisplayPort.\n\nWhat's better than one 3K 16-inch OLED screen on a gaming laptop? Two 3K 16-inch OLED screens, of course. While this isn't the first time Asus has experimented with a multi-monitor display on one of its ROG laptops, this new take on the Zephyrus Duo looks like a wild approach to dual-screen gaming.\n\nHolograms make everything cooler, and Asus is leveraging this technology to create a seriously cool PC gaming case. The Asus ROG GM1000 can use its case fans to project holographic images, and users can upload their own GIFs and short MP4s to create custom effects.\n\nGameSir might be onto something, as the idea of a gaming controller with a dedicated steering wheel right in the center sounds like a fun idea. You've got all the inputs you'd require from modern gaming, a direct drive motor, and up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering, the company claims (via The Verge). Pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed.\n\nGameSir's other big controller reveal was the X5 Alteron, a Swiss Army knife of a peripheral designed for iPad, iPhone, Android, and Nintendo Switch. HyperX is helping develop it, and the modular system lets you customize the controller with various modules. This means that you can customize it extensively with different D-pads, thumbsticks, and buttons to create your dream controller.\n\nA gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port, the 8BitDo FlipPad borrows heavily from the design of the classic Nintendo Game Boy. The company says it'll reveal more details on the Android and iOS controller ahead of its launch in Summer 2026.\n\nIt might look visually inspired by Nespresso coffee machines, but the new mid-tower case unveiled by CyberPowerPC at CES has an elegant quality. It has everything you'd expect--tempered glass panels, mesh ventilation, and ports--but the real showstopper here is a selection of knobs for controlling the LEDs on this sleek case.\n\n8BitDo makes some of the best controllers, and at CES 2026, it unveiled the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E wireless modular controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple devices, and Android. Just don't expect this to be a budget-friendly option, as the Ultimate 3E will retail for $150 at launch in Q2 2026.\n\nIf you're a fan of Kojima Productions--the studio headed by famed game developer Hideo Kojima--then you'll want to check out these new peripherals from Asus. This special-edition hardware features hand-drawn illustrations by Yoji Shinkawa--the art director for the Death Stranding games--and it'll launch on February 4.\n\nThe newly revealed Corsair Galleon 100 SD mechanical keyboard doesn't have a numpad, but it does have a built-in Elgato Stream Deck Plus. This part of the keyboard features 12 customizable buttons, a five-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and rotary dials. It launches on January 29 and it's priced at $350.\n\nRazer's Project Ava is aiming to be a holographic AI desktop companion that can fulfill several roles. From lifestyle reminders to gaming wingman, the device will come with several AI personalities and is expected to launch within the first half of 2026.\n\nWe're skeptical about this concept for a \"non-invasive\" gaming headset that supposedly improves your skills in competitive games, but at least Neurable and HyperX's protoype looks like a comfy set of brain-scanning cans.\n\nUltrawide monitors have become a popular option over the years, but laptop users can't enjoy them on the go--unless they want to lug a spare monitor around. That's where this concept for a rollable screen comes in: Lenovo is courting \"athletes who need pro-level performance\" with its gaming laptop. The screen can unfurl to 16, 21.5, and 24 inches.\n\nHyperX isn't the only company with AI-powered headphones at CES 2026, as Razer also showed off its Project Motoko concept. The idea behind this wireless headset is that it uses a ton of tech--including two 4K cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, near and far field microphones, and built-in AI--to serve a similar function to other AI wearables, like taking photos, translating foreign text, or conversing with an AI assistant.\n\nIt's not gaming tech, but this $399 ultrasonic chef's knife from Seattle Ultrasonics is the closest thing we have to owning a high-frequency blade in real life. Can it effortlessly cut through a Metal Gear mech? Probably not, but the vibrating piezoelectric ceramic crystals will let you slice through fruit and vegetables easily.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't have a new GPU to show off this year, the company did reveal its DLSS 4.5 upscaling technology. The company claims it can dynamically boost performance in compatible games, enabling up to 240+ frames per second with path tracing on 50-series GPU cards.",

    "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2 was indisputably a sales hit after its June 2025 launch, but a new report indicates that the hybrid console's success may not match up to the original Switch's first holiday season.\nAccording to The Game Business, Switch 2 sales in the United States were down by around 35% from November to December compared to Switch 1 sales during the same period in its launch year of 2017. This statistic tracks with an earlier report from Circana revealing that November 2025 was the worst month for hardware sales in the US since 1995.\nThe Switch 2 didn't fare much better in European countries, with UK sales having a reported fall of 16% compared to the Switch 1 in Holiday 2017. In France, Switch 2 unit numbers for its inaugural year are reportedly over 30% lower than what the Switch 1 achieved during its first year.",

    "title": "Japan’s Biggest Automaker Spins Up an Entirely New Brand to Live Alongside Toyota and Lexus",
    "description": "Toyota Gazoo Racing will now just be Gazoo Racing and serve as 'Yota's standalone performance division.",
    "fullText": "Toyota Gazoo Racing will now just be Gazoo Racing and serve as ‘Yota’s standalone performance division.\n\nIt’s official: Gazoo Racing is now Toyota’s performance subbrand. The automaker officialized the move ahead of its press conferences at the Tokyo Auto Salon.\n\nYears in the making, Toyota’s motorsports division grew at a rapid pace, becoming a fixture and symbol of performance for Japan’s largest automaker. So yes, that means Gazoo Racing, or GR, is what NISMO is to Nissan, M is to BMW and AMG is to Mercedes-Benz (and so on).\n\nWhat does this news bring? Well, for starters, that means we can expect an influx of fast and fun cars from the brand that was once seen as “the most boring carmaker.”\n\nA little while ago, Toyota and Lexus shocked the world with the GR GT supercar and the LFA Concept. The automotive world first took note of the clues when the GR GT didn’t feature any Toyota insignias or badges anywhere.\n\nFor those who knew what this could mean, it was a sign. The new coupes were more than just a product and a halo car showcase.\n\nFor Toyota, it signaled a turning point that Gazoo Racing was going to grow even more. After finding success with the Supra revival and the second-gen 86, both of which are badged as GR models (GR Supra, GR86) the automaker chose to keep the momentum going.\n\nThen came the GR Corolla, the GR Yaris in Europe and Asia. And now, the division says we can expect more fun models to be on the way. But fans and enthusiasts are also probably wondering, “what does this mean for Toyota Racing Development, or TRD?”\n\nWell, we’re wondering about that too. But Toyota hasn’t really explained what GR means for TRD.\n\nTRD was once Toyota’s official performance division. But with GR likely replacing it, it’s safe to say TRD is probably falling to the wayside and into the pages of Toyota history.\n\nWith the official establishment of Gazoo Racing as Toyota’s in-house performance branch, this, of course, means we can expect more fun, performance models in the near future.\n\nDetails are limited. However, the automotive world is anticipating several new arrivals. Such include a sixth-gen Supra, an MR2 revival and even a next-gen GR Corolla.\n\nOne thing all of these performance models will share in common is that they won’t be branded as Toyotas. To keep with Gazoo Racing’s ethos of being a standalone sub-brand, Toyota is treating the division as its own separate entity.\n\nGR will operate similarly to Lexus and its other sub-brands, Daihatsu and the more recently established Century.\n\nBut GR won’t just be sticking to road-going production cars. It’ll continue to evolve as Toyota’s motorsports division, with plans to compete in all the top racing leagues, including the FIA World Rally Championship.\n\nWant to stay up to date on the latest product news and releases? Add Gear Patrol as a preferred source to ensure our independent journalism makes it to the top of your Google search results.",

The compensation is tied entirely to the company's performance and depends on a major turnaround. To earn it, Cohen must increase GameStop's market value by more than 10 times and significantly raise profits.\nMeeting these goals would require a big change for GameStop, which has struggled in recent years. Its stock price is also severely down from the record highs reached in 2021, when GameStop gained popularity among retail investors during the meme-stock surge.",

The OP added that they and their fiancé would have helped earlier if they had known, particularly because the household included the fiancé's severely disabled father and a disabled adult daughter.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nMissed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs? This Platform Lets Everyday Investors Access Private Tech Early\n\nThe situation became known only after the family was evicted. At that point, the OP booked an extended-stay hotel and paid for one week in advance.\n\nWhile discussing how the family would pay for the hotel, the OP was told that disability payments would be used for housing. However, the OP later discovered that the fiancé continued paying for the hotel and a storage unit using their joint bank account without informing them.\n\nAt the time, the OP was focused on growing a business and caring for their child and did not immediately notice the charges. When the OP later reviewed their finances, they discovered that more than $11,000 had been used.\n\nAfter reviewing the account activity, the OP drove to the hotel and told the fiancé's family that no additional money from the joint account would be used. \"If one more cent is used, I will break the engagement,\" the OP told the fiancé.\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThe OP wrote that the money had been intended for a planned home purchase and their daughter's school expenses. The OP also stated that the foreclosure had been hidden and that the money was used without their approval.\n\nThe OP added that they and their fiancé have been together for 13 years and have never had a close relationship with the fiancé's family. According to the post, the fiancé's mother rarely interacts with their child.\n\nIn a later edit, the OP added that the fiancé's family had previously received a legal settlement worth several million dollars and spent it.\n\n\"I moved all the money into my personal account,\" the OP wrote, adding that the fiancé \"will now have to ask me if he needs any of it.\"\n\nThe OP also wrote that the fiancé accepted responsibility for using the joint funds without discussion.\n\nSee Also: $100k+ in investable assets?

    "description": "Sara Lopez developed transverse myelitis, which disrupts the messages sent from the spinal cord to the rest of the body",
    "fullText": "A two-year-old girl in Georgia has been left paralyzed after suffering a rare condition brought on after she contracted the flu, according to her parents.\n\nSara Lopez, 2, fell victim to transverse myelitis, a disorder the Mayo Clinic describes as being triggered by influenza and other ailments that target body tissue. According to the clinic, transverse myelitis interrupts the messages sent from the spinal cord to the rest of the body. This can result in pain, muscle loss, and, as happened to Sara, paralysis.\n\nKenia Lopez, the girl's mother, told Fox 5 Atlanta that four of her six children came down with the flu in December. While children and adults often get the flu and recover without issue, Lopez said Sara began showing strange symptoms on December 19.\n\n\"After a few hours of her being uncomfortable, we noticed that she really wasn’t moving her arms,\" Lopez told the broadcaster.\n\nThe family took Sara to a hospital, where doctors diagnosed her with the flu. But the little girl's condition worsened, so the family took her to another hospital — Erlanger's Children's Hospital in Chattanooga — when she began losing the use of other parts of her body.\n\nSara required a week of intubation, and — though recovering — she still has difficulty moving, according to her mother.\n\nTransverse myelitis causes inflammation on both sides of one section of the spinal cord, which can then disrupt how the spinal cord communicates with the rest of the body.\n\nAs in Sara's case, symptoms can include paralysis as well as pain, weakness in the muscles, sensory issues, and dysfunction in the bowel or the bladder, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nWhile the flu can lead to transverse myelitis, the disorder can arise any time infections or immune system disorders attack the body's tissues, according to the clinic.\n\nMost people with transverse myelitis recover, at least partially, but individuals who suffer severe cases can be left with significant disabilities.\n\nLopez told Fox 5 Atlanta that she opted not to get Sara a flu vaccine this year, and said she hopes other parents learn from her situation and get their children protected.\n\nIn the meantime, Sara’s cousin, Jailyn Beltran, has started a GoFundMe to help her family with the two-year-old’s medical bills.\n\n“[Sara’s] parents, who are caring for six children, are unable to work during this time, making things even more difficult for the whole family. It’s heartbreaking to see Sarah in this condition, and it hurts even more to watch my aunt and the rest of my cousins struggle alongside her,” Beltran wrote.\n\nShe said that “the funds raised through this campaign will go directly toward helping Sara’s family with the many challenges they’re facing.”\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, 11 million people have been diagnosed with the flu this season. Approximately 130 million have received a flu shot this year, which is down by 13 million when compared to last year",

    "description": "A separate judge ruled in November that Halligan, a Trump ally who prosecuted James Comey and Letitia James, had been unlawfully appointed to her position.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge Tuesday ordered Trump ally Lindsey Halligan to explain why she continues to call herself the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia even though another judge determined in November that she had been unlawfully appointed to the position.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Novak of Richmond issued a three-page order demanding to know why Halligan is still serving in the post. Halligan, who unsuccessfully prosecuted former FBI Direct James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, is also referred to as U.S. attorney by the Justice Department in official documents.\n\nThe judge's order is unusual because he issued it on his own, not at the request of defense attorneys. It came in a case involving a carjacking and attempted bank robbery suspect who was indicted last month.\n\nNovak gave Halligan seven days to respond in writing “explaining the basis for ... identification of herself as the United States Attorney, notwithstanding Judge Currie’s contrary ruling. She shall also set forth the reasons why this Court should not strike Ms. Halligan’s identification of herself as United States Attorney from the indictment in this matter.”\n\nThe judge’s order goes on to say Halligan \"shall further explain why her identification does not constitute a false or misleading statement.\" Novak also alluded to potential disciplinary action and demanded that Halligan sign her response.\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.\n\nIn late November, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie found that the Justice Department had violated the Constitution by appointing Halligan as U.S. attorney. That finding led to the dismissal of criminal cases against Comey and James.\n\nCurrie ruled that all actions “flowing from Ms. Halligan’s defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey’s indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power.” She issued a separate, similar ruling in the James case, saying Halligan had exercised power she “did not lawfully possess.”\n\nNovak acknowledged Tuesday that the November ruling regarding Halligan’s appointment had been appealed but said that since the order had not been paused, it remains the “binding precedent of the district and is not subject to being ignored.”\n\nOther judges in the district have previously expressed their frustration with Halligan, including one who now places an asterisk next to Halligan’s name on every court document and next to it refers to Currie's ruling from November.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "title": "Exclusive-The Trump Administration killed a draft proposal to halve alcohol limits, sources say",
    "description": "Last spring, a group of officials from the U.S.",
    "fullText": "LONDON/NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Last spring, a group of officials from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was drafting a proposal to halve the recommended limit for alcohol consumption for men to one drink a day, according to two former government sources and a document seen by Reuters.\n\n\"Alcohol is known to cause cancer,\" the health officials wrote in the draft version of their proposal reviewed by Reuters. The group was tasked with leading an update to alcohol advice in the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the U.S. government's roadmap ​to healthy drinking and eating that influences school lunches, medical advice and other policies.\n\nThe draft proposal added that if both men and women had one or fewer drinks per day it could save thousands of U.S. lives per year. Advice for women would have remained the same at one drink per day.\n\n\"It ‌seemed clear to me that the cancer epidemiology suggested that there was an increased risk of breast cancer and head and neck cancer associated with less than one drink per day,” said David Berrigan, a former program director at the National Cancer Institute, an arm of the U.S. health department, who was part of the group that planned to recommend tightening the guidelines.\n\nBut the proposal never saw the light of day.\n\nOn Wednesday, ‌the Trump administration took the opposite tack, publishing new guidelines that give no advice at all on servings, instead just advising Americans to drink less for better health.\n\nThe change eliminates a recommendation in place for 35 years that men limit alcohol consumption to two drinks per day and women to one drink per day. It also followed a years-long lobbying campaign by the alcohol industry, worth some $1.2 trillion in global sales according to drinks market research firm IWSR, to disrupt the health officials' work.\n\nPublic health experts and researchers warned the change could lead to higher alcohol consumption and, ultimately, more alcohol-linked death and disease.\n\n“People will redefine that moderation around what it means to them and, obviously, that can be a very large range,” said Karen Hacker, who served as Director of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention until 2025.\n\nIn a statement, HHS said its policies were driven by evidence and gold-standard science. “It is absurd to suggest that anything other than science guides our work on this presidential priority.”\n\nAt a White House press conference ⁠announcing the guidance on Wednesday, Mehmet Oz, celebrity physician and administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said that ‌alcohol should be consumed in small amounts. “Don’t have it for breakfast,” he said.\n\nThere was never good data supporting the prior guidance of two drinks per day for men and one for women, he continued.\n\nA White House official told Reuters it was clear from the new guidelines that the Trump Administration was not being influenced by industry, and added alcohol consumption was at a multi-decade low anyway.\n\nTrump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. do not drink and the Make America Healthy Again social movement aligned with them makes minimal reference to ‍alcohol, focusing its efforts on reducing childhood vaccinations, a position decried by major medical groups, and having fewer preservatives in food.\n\nThe International Alliance for Responsible Drinking, a group funded by leading brewers and spirits makers, says that drinking in moderation is low risk. Industry groups and companies either declined to comment, did not respond or said they wanted to ensure any changes to guidance were based on science.\n\nAndrew Langer, director of the Center for Regulatory Freedom at the Conservative Political Conference Foundation, called the new guidelines a “compromise position” between “the neo-temperance movement saying people should not drink anything at all and another group who says the U.S. government shouldn’t be making statements about alcohol.”\n\nHe said it would be “a little hypocritical and disingenuous” for the administration to take steps to loosen regulations on marijuana and ​psychedelics while implementing tighter policy on drinking.\n\nThe U.S. dietary guidelines are the focus of lobbying by the industries they impact, including everything from sugar, cattle and dairy to the wine, beer, and spirits industries.\n\nTop producers like Johnnie Walker whisky maker Diageo and Molson Coors, owner of Miller Lite, and their trade associations, started campaigning on the ‌2025-2030 guidelines at least as far back as 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Congress set aside $1.3 million for a study on the health effects of alcohol to be conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a congressionally chartered non-profit. Two former alcohol lobbyists said that the industry lobbied lawmakers for the study.\n\nFunding for the study was first proposed in a bill introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, a major production hub for Molson Coors, the second-largest brewer in the U.S.\n\nLobbying disclosures show lobbyists for Molson Coors and the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States petitioned lawmakers on Baldwin’s bill in 2022. The spirits industry body said in a statement it wanted to ensure alcohol guidance is grounded in “sound science - not opinion or ideology.”\n\nBaldwin’s office said the legislation was written with input from several lawmakers but that she stood by funding the study as “sound science necessary to inform public health guidelines.”\n\nMolson did not respond to requests for comment, and Diageo declined to comment.\n\nReleased in December 2024, the NASEM study concluded that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk of dying from any cause, a finding the industry regularly promotes, though it also found some negative health effects.\n\nMeanwhile, in February 2022, officials at HHS began planning a separate study on the health effects of alcohol, public records show. That study, conducted by six scientists commissioned by the health officials and called the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, ⁠warned that even one drink a day can raise the risk of liver, mouth and throat cancers. Draft findings from that study were released in January 2025.\n\nIndustry groups argued that the NASEM report ​was more independent, credible and scientific than the government's work, which it said was being led by scientists biased against alcohol, a position public health groups disputed.\n\nIn January 2025, Science Over Bias, a coalition of ​alcohol, agriculture and hospitality associations, said in a statement the HHS report was the product of a “flawed, opaque and unprecedented process, rife with bias and conflicts of interest” and should be disregarded.\n\nPriscilla Martinez, one of the HHS-commissioned scientists who worked on the Alcohol Intake and Health study, said that “people should know alcohol causes cancer.” She added that she is disappointed that the report, which she called scientifically rigorous, had been sidelined.\n\nALCOHOL EXPERTS FIRED OR REASSIGNED\n\nOn February 13, around a month after both studies were released, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. was sworn in as Trump’s ‍health secretary.\n\nIn early April, Kennedy laid off more than 10,000 people in a major overhaul ⁠of the health department and its agencies. Two out of five key health officials that planned to recommend tighter guidelines, including the CDC’s alcohol lead, were fired as part of the mass layoffs, according to two former government sources.\n\nThe remainder were subsequently removed from the alcohol project, the two people said. One of those people said the remaining team were removed and replaced in May.\n\nDorothy Fink, a senior health official with a background in endocrinology, took over writing the guidelines for alcohol, three sources familiar with the matter said. Fink did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson pointed Reuters to information in the scientific ⁠report accompanying the guidelines, which stated that the Trump Administration had pursued its own evidence reviews and scientific work to inform them, conducted by subject matter experts.\n\nThe Trump administration ultimately used the industry-preferred NASEM study for the new alcohol guidelines, according to the scientific report.\n\nJennifer Tiller, a newly appointed senior advisor at USDA, also oversaw the guidelines for drinking, meeting with alcohol trade groups in the spring and summer, emails obtained ‌by Reuters show. Tiller previously worked as a Congressional staffer, a role in which she questioned the health officials’ work on alcohol, according to emails obtained by Reuters.\n\nTiller referred Reuters' questions to the USDA press office. A USDA spokesperson said the guidelines are based on scientific evidence: “Recommendations, just like ‌evidence, evolve over time.”",

    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Wednesday that he will visit China next week to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping as Canada looks to reduce its reliance on the United States, which has threatened its economy and sovereignty.\n\nIt is the first visit to China by a Canadian prime minister in more than eight years. Xi invited Carney to China when they met during an Asia-Pacific summit in October. The visit comes as the two countries move to restore stronger ties after years of tensions.\n\n“We’re forging new partnerships around the world to transform our economy from one that has been reliant on a single trade partner, to one that is stronger and more resilient to global shock,” Carney said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nCarney will travel to China from Jan. 13 to 17. He will also attend the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland from Jan. 19 to 21.\n\nTrump has been threatening Canada’s economy and sovereignty with tariffs, most offensively by claiming Canada could be “the 51st state.”\n\nThe attempt at rapprochement with China comes as Carney looks to double Canada’s non-U.S. exports in the next decade and as the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico is up for review this year. More than 75% percent of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.\n\nChina is Canada's second largest trading partner.\n\nRelations between China and Canada took a nosedive in late 2018 after Canadian authorities arrested a senior executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei as a part of its extradition agreement with the United States. China then arrested two Canadian citizens in retaliation.\n\nMore recently, relations have been shaken by Canada’s decision to levy a 100% tariff on electric vehicles, batteries and other goods from China in 2024. Canada made the move in tandem with the U.S.\n\nCanadian canola producers, seafood exporters and pork farmers are dealing with steep Chinese tariffs in retaliation.\n\nChina has offered to remove its import taxes on some Canadian products if Canada drops the EV tariff.",

    "fullText": "Kyle Rittenhouse’s return to social media back in December and it has not been smooth sailing for him since.\n\nJust a week into his return, he was called a joke and an idiot by Walton County (Florida) Sheriff Michael Adkinson, a Republican, after he framed a shooting there as a Second Amendment case.\n\nRittenhouse seems to have moved on from that to making interesting posts on X.\n\nWhich leads us to Wednesday and shooting death of a woman in Minneapolis at the hands of an ICE officer.\n\nRittenhouse, who is famous for shooting three people, killing two, during a racial injustice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 2020 before claiming self-defense and being acquitted of all charges, felt the need to chime in.\n\n“FAFO — don’t try and hit a ICE agent with your vehicle and you won’t end up in the forever box,” he wrote on X. “It’s pretty simple.”\n\nHe followed that up with another post that read, “After thinking about it, should I travel across the state line to Minnesota?”\n\nAfter thinking about it, should I travel across the state line to Minnesota? 😆\n\n— Kyle Rittenhouse 🇺🇸 (@rittenhouse2a) January 7, 2026\n\nThat, of course, kicked up a social media stir.\n\n“How do you even look yourself in the mirror in the morning?” one person replied.\n\n“Someone was murdered you (expletive) (expletive),” another wrote. “There is nothing to laugh about you (expletive) truly are evil and I can’t wait for karma to catch up.”\n\nSeveral more posted photos of Rittenhouse crying on the stand during his trial and took digs at him.\n\nThere were some who supported the post, though.\n\n“Amazing how one can fire into a crowd of liberals and instantly hit a pedophile, woman beater and career criminal,” one person replied with a meme. “It’s as if their party is made up entirely of subhumans!”\n\n“Well, I didn’t fire into the crowd …” Rittenhouse replied. “I fired extremely well-placed shots, hitting only the people attack and trying to kill me. But yes, they were criminal scum.”\n\nHe later wrote, “I forgot how easy it is to bait the media into writing retarded stories about me. The media is fake and gay.”\n\nRittenhouse announced in December that he was returning to social media saying that the assassination of Charlie Kirk convinced him he “couldn’t sit on the sidelines anymore.”\n\n“So I’m back,” he wrote. “Not quietly. Not halfway. I’m coming back in a big way.”",

    "fullText": "The job market is notoriously difficult in 2026, but living in one of these 20 cities could make the search a bit easier.\n\nWalletHub examined a total of 182 US cities — the 150 most populated cities in the country, plus at least two of the most populated cities in each state — to determine the best cities for job seekers in 2026.\n\nIt evaluated 31 metrics to score and rank each city in two categories: job market and socioeconomics.\n\nThe job market category, which was weighted more heavily, included factors such as job opportunities, unemployment rates, job satisfaction, and access to employee benefits. The socioeconomics category looked at median annual incomes, average work and commute times, housing affordability, and safety.\n\nThe study used data from multiple sources, including the US Census Bureau, the US Department of Labor, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Indeed, Glassdoor, The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Council for Community and Economic Research, and Gallup-Sharecare, among others.\n\n\"It's important to look at more than just the number of jobs available or the unemployment rate when determining the best place to find employment,\" WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo wrote. \"Quality matters just as much as quantity, from the average salaries and benefits to job security and overall satisfaction.\"\n\nOut of the 182 US cities WalletHub analyzed, here are the top 20 best places for jobs in 2026.\n\nCharleston's job market is ranked 25th out of the 182 cities WalletHub studied. Its socioeconomic factors are ranked 33rd.\n\nBoston's job market is ranked 20th, and its socioeconomics rank 48th.\n\nIrving has one of the best job markets in the US, according to the WalletHub analysis, placing fifth in the ranking. However, its socioeconomic factors rank 137th.\n\nOverland Park has one of the highest median annual incomes in a five-way tie with other cities, including Columbia, Maryland, and Scottsdale, Arizona. Its job market is ranked 30th overall, and its socioeconomics are ranked 13th.\n\nBismarck's job market is ranked 37th overall, but its socioeconomic factors are ranked No. 1. thanks to it having the fourth-most affordable housing of the cities examined, according to WalletHub.\n\nLewiston has the 12th-best job market and 60th-best socioeconomics in WalletHub's ranking.\n\nThe job market in Chandler ranks 19th overall. The city's socioeconomic ranking is 20th.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, the job market is ranked 14th and the socioeconomics are ranked 39th.\n\nAtlanta has the 22nd-best job market and the eighth-best socioeconomic factors out of the US cities WalletHub ranked.\n\nCharleston's job market is ranked 11th. Its socioeconomic ranking is 45th.\n\nIn Huntsville, the job market is ranked ninth, and the socioeconomic factors are ranked 44th.\n\nComing in at 15th in WalletHub's overall job market ranking and 10th in the socioeconomic ranking, Austin made the top 10 best cities for jobs.\n\nThe nation's capital boasts the highest monthly average starting salary of any US city, placing its job market ranking at seventh overall. However, it also has the second-longest commute times. Its socio-economic ranking is 43rd.\n\nPlano's job market ranks sixth in WalletHub's analysis. Its socioeconomic ranking is 40th.\n\nOrlando is the city with the third-most job opportunities in the US, WalletHub reported. Its job market ranks fourth overall, while its socioeconomics rank 38th.\n\nPittsburgh, known for its healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing industries, has the most job opportunities of any city in the US, WalletHub found, contributing to its 10th-best overall job market ranking. It also ranks high in socioeconomics with the third-best overall placement.\n\nSouth Burlington's job market ranks eighth overall in WalletHub's analysis, bolstered by one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. Its socioeconomics are ranked the second-best in the US.\n\nPortland has no shortage of job openings, ranking 21st in job opportunities per capita and 12th in full-time job opportunities at highly rated companies on Glassdoor. Portland also has the second-highest percentage of workers whose jobs include access to an employer-based retirement plan, WalletHub found.\n\nCombined with its safety ranking with the 23rd-lowest violent crime rate in the US, Portland comes in as the third-best city for jobs overall.\n\nIt has the second-best job market ranking and the 30th highest socioeconomics ranking.\n\nWalletHub found that Columbia has the highest median household income in the US — when adjusted for cost of living — at $129,000, which contributes to its ranking as the second-best city for jobs in 2026.\n\nThe city's affordable rent also helped solidify its ranking. A two-bedroom apartment costs around 16% of the median household income, which is the fifth-lowest percentage in the US.\n\nColumbia's job market is ranked third overall. Its socioeconomic factors are ranked fourth.\n\nWith one of the lowest unemployment rates in the US, Scottsdale is ranked the No. 1 best city for jobs in 2026. It ranks 16th in paid internship opportunities, seventh in recreation, and has the 11th-lowest violent crime rate in the country, making it a well-rounded city for workers.\n\nResidents of Scottsdale also earn a median household income of $101,000, one of the highest in the US.\n\nIt earned first place in WalletHub's job market ranking and 16th place in the socioeconomics category.",

    "description": "I sampled first and business class on the Amtrak NextGen Acela. From the seats to the food and lounge access, here's how the two experiences compared.",
    "fullText": "I spent six hours and $630 on the fastest train in America.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela is the express option for travelers in the Northeast with only business and first-class seating. In August 2025, the route got a fresh new fleet called the NextGen Acela. In addition to a futuristic look and modern amenities, the train has a top speed of 160 miles per hour, making it the fastest train in the US.\n\nIn September 2025, I booked round-trip tickets between my home in New York City and Washington, DC, on the NextGen Acela. I got a taste of both classes.\n\nSince the Acela doesn't have coach seating, business class is the standard ticket.\n\nMy first-class ticket included a meal, priority boarding, attendant service, and lounge access at the train station.\n\nI waited for my business-class train to Washington, DC, on the floor of NYC's Penn Station. The waiting room was full, and it would have cost me $50 to access the Metropolitan Lounge, which is complimentary for first-class passengers.\n\nSince I held a first-class ticket for my ride home from Washington, DC, I had access to the Metropolitan Lounge at Union Station. Other passengers can pay $35 to enter the space.\n\nThe lounge was quiet and calm. There were couches, comfy chairs, tables, and colorful works of art on the walls. I especially appreciated the espresso and beverage station, snack bins stocked with a variety of treats — all of which were complimentary — and the clean bathroom.\n\nAfter relaxing in the lounge, I waltzed into the priority boarding lane for my first-class ride to New York. There were fewer than a dozen people in front of me.\n\nUnlike when I rode in business class, where I was toward the back of a long line, I had several minutes to get situated on board before the train departed.\n\nAboard the Acela train, I quickly caught on that blue meant business class and red meant first class. From the headrests to the bathroom doors, the matching colors made it easy to tell which car I was in.\n\nAnother key difference was the layout. There were two rows of seats on either side of the aisle in business class, while first class had a single row of seats on one side of the aisle.\n\nDuring my business-class ride, I grabbed a bite in the café car, where passengers can purchase grab-and-go meals from a self-service station, as well as snacks, drinks, and quick hot meals prepared by an attendant. I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which I thought tasted pretty decent for a microwaved meal, and brought it back to my seat.\n\nIn first class, I received attendant service and had a menu of complimentary meals to choose from.\n\nI selected the chicken dish, which consisted of a charred thigh paired with roasted squash, verde sauce, a hard roll, and a Key-lime pie in a jar.\n\nIt was the most delicious and satisfying meal I'd ever had on an Amtrak train.\n\nSave for the color of the door, the bathrooms in each class are the same, an Amtrak representative told Business Insider. I was impressed by how clean, spacious, and high-tech they were.\n\nThese bathrooms featured automatic doors, lights to indicate when the space was in use, and ample room to stretch. I also appreciated the touch-free faucets, soap dispensers, and hand dryers.\n\nAfter my back-to-back three-hour journeys on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train, I expected to be thrilled to get off the rails. But my experiences were so comfortable that I was in no rush to exit. When we pulled into NYC's Penn Station, I let other passengers get off first while I soaked up a few more minutes in my first-class seat.",

More importantly, there will also be a Towelie sidekick in the shop for all the sweaty gamers out there.\n\nThe single biggest change being introduced with this crossover event is the addition of Quints, a five-player variety of the main Battle Royale mode, playable in both Build and Zero Build. It's the first time Epic has added a new squad size to BR since it added Trios about five years ago, so this is kind of a big deal. We don't know for sure if Quints will stick around beyond this event, though. Epic previously added a six-player version of Blitz Royale earlier this year, but removed it after a few weeks.\n\nThe Kenny token, which you can find as random loot, is an entirely new gameplay concept for Battle Royale. If you have one of these tokens when you die, you'll automatically reboot. That'll be quite a game-changer, depending on how common these end up being.\n\nWhile this may seem like just another consumable healing item, Cheesy Poofs are also a weapon--throwing a box at an enemy will damage them. The days of feeling like an idiot because you accidentally threw a shield pot at the other guy when you tried to switch to a different gun are finally over. At least temporarily.\n\nOnly one Stick of Truth will appear each round, and the person who claims it will become the round's final boss. But not because it turns you into a kaiju or gives you sick abilities--having the Stick of Truth in your inventory will make the storm circle center on you for the remainder of the match.\n\nThe Wonkeeland POI in the northwest part of the island has received a South Park-themed makeover and is now Cartmanland, based on the theme park Cartman took over on the show. It's still more or less the same place, just with Cartman's face all over it.\n\nFor the first time in almost two years, Fortnite is doing a new event mini-pass. This one is completely free to everyone, and includes 13 tiers of items that you can unlock by completing quests in Battle Royale--meaning this is not the sort of pass that you can passively get through by gaining XP. We don't know what all the pass will include, but among them are Terrance and Phillip dolls as a pickaxe, and a CRED backpack.\n\nThe very last reward on the pass, which requires completing every available South Park pass quest, is the Imaginationland Airship glider, which comes from an epic three-episode story in Season 10 that was originally planned to be a theatrical movie.",

The company promises to answer patient phone calls, handle scheduling and refills — and cut down the hours of grunt work that comes with a medical visit.\n\nTivara has raised a $3.6 million seed round, backed by Plaid CEO Zach Perret's Mischief VC, Day One Ventures, Y Combinator, and healthcare industry angel investors.\n\nBefore cofounding Tivara, Seelamsetty worked as head of growth for Fair Square, a technology-enabled Medicare brokerage.\n\n\"I saw a ton of back-and-forth between beneficiaries and insurance carriers,\" he said. \"There's just a ton of paper-pushing.\"\n\nSeelamsetty met his cofounder while studying computer science at Washington University in St. Louis. The duo called \"every single doctor we knew\" and asked to shadow their practices, he said.\n\nTivara focuses on large specialty medical groups with between 20 and 500 doctors. Its customers include the Los Angeles Cancer Network and Astera Customer Care.\n\nIt's one of many AI-assisted patient messaging startups. Seelamsetty said Tivara distinguishes itself by being administrative, not clinical. Doctors are left to sift through the these startups in an effort to identify which offer genuine productivity gains (and which could overcomplicate or add time).\n\nTivara now has five full-time employees and is using the funds to expand its team. The $3.6 million was over Seelamsetty's target, he said; they wanted to make room for more strategic investors.",

Over a decade later, with two best picture wins to its name, that still rings true.\n\nIt's shaping up to be a busy year for A24, which both produces films in-house and acquires films to distribute.\n\nFrom a mockumentary starring Charli XCX to a Robert Pattinson/Zendaya team-up and an Anthony Bourdain biopic, here's what you can expect from A24 this year.\n\nCharli XCX will play a fictionalized version of herself undertaking the \"Brat\" tour in \"The Moment,\" a mockumentary directed by Aidan Zamiri and \"based on an original idea\" by XCX.\n\nRosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Alexander Skarsgård, Kylie Jenner, Rish Shah, and Rachel Sennott also star.\n\nAlexander Skarsgård and Harry Melton costar in \"Pillion,\" a romantic black comedy film based on the novel \"Box Hill.\"\n\nIn it, Melton plays a shy young man drawn to Ray (Skarsgård), a biker who is only interested in a, let's say, unconventional relationship.\n\n\"How to Make a Killing\" is director John Patton Ford's follow-up to \"Emily the Criminal.\"\n\nIt stars Glen Powell as Becket Redfellow, a man who's been disowned by his obscenely wealthy birth family. He decides to kill all of the cousins standing in the way of his inheritance.\n\nMargaret Qualley, Jessica Henwick, Bill Camp, Zach Woods, and Topher Grace also star.\n\n\"Undertone\" is a horror film starring Nina Kiri as a podcaster who's terrorized by paranormal recordings sent to her show. Kiri's character, Evy, is the only person shown on screen; every other character is voice-only.\n\nThe first of three Zendaya/Pattinson cinematic collaborations this year is \"The Drama,\" directed by Kristoffer Borgli (\"Dream Scenario,\" \"Sick of Myself\").\n\nThe film's logline reads: \"A happily engaged couple is put to the test when an unexpected turn sends their wedding week off the rails.\"\n\nAlso starring are Zoë Winters, Alana Haim, and Mamoudou Athie.\n\nDirector David Lowery returns to the screen with \"Mother Mary,\" a tale in which \"iconic pop star Mother Mary (Anne Hathaway) reunites with her estranged best friend and former costume designer Sam Anselm (Michaela Coel) on the eve of her comeback performance,\" and drama ensues.\n\nThe film also stars Hunter Schafer, Sian Clifford, FKA Twigs, and Kaia Gerber.\n\nIf you haven't heard of \"Backrooms,\" you haven't been on the creepypasta side of the internet.\n\nThis horror film is based on a series of short films directed by Kane Parsons (known online as Kane Pixels). The plot is being kept under wraps, but the film will star Chiwetel Ejiofor, Renate Reinsve, Avan Jogia, Mark Duplass, Lukita Maxwell, and Finn Bennett.\n\nWhile \"The Death of Robin Hood\" is still undated, the first trailer and poster were released on January 6 with the promise that it would be \"coming soon.\"\n\nThe film, directed by Michael Sarnoski of \"Pig\" and \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" fame, stars Hugh Jackman as an aged Robin Hood who is reckoning with the cost of his violent life.\n\nBill Skarsgård costars as Little John, along with Jodie Comer, Murray Bartlett, and Noah Jupe.\n\nThis Sofia Coppola-directed documentary about Marc Jacobs premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival, but it won't be available to the general public until some point this year.\n\nAnother A24 documentary is \"Nuisance Bear,\" an expansion of the 2021 short film of the same name. It's about the Canadian town of Churchill, located in the province of Manitoba. It's known as the polar bear capital of the world, leading to some friction between locals, tourists, and the bears.\n\nIt's set to premiere at Sundance Film Festival in January.\n\nIn \"Famous,\" Zac Efron will have a dual role as movie star James Jansen and a \"loser\" named Lance Dunkquist who bears an uncanny resemblance to Jansen and uses that to his advantage.\n\nIt also stars Phoebe Dynevor, Nicholas Braun, Stephanie Koenig, Debby Ryan, Mekki Leeper, Cory Michael Smith, and Bill Pullman.\n\nChris Rock's newest directorial offering will be \"Misty Green,\" which follows an actor, Misty (played by Rosalind Eleazar, known to \"Slow Horses\" fans), who reconnects with someone from her past\n\nRock, Adam Driver, Daniel Kaluuya, Anna Kendrick, Topher Grace, and Anthony Anderson will also star.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Rebel Ridge,\" director Jeremy Saulnier will next direct a horror-action film called \"October,\" starring Cory Michael Smith, Chase Sui Wonders, Sophie Wilde, Young Mazino, Stephen Root, and more.\n\nDan Stevens will team up once again with director Adam Wingard and screenwriter Simon Barrett in the action film \"Onslaught\" after working together on \"The Guest\" and \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.\"\n\nAdria Arjona stars in \"Onslaught\" as a \"mother living in a trailer park [who] tries to protect her loved ones from a threat that has escaped from a secret military base, while mercenaries try to contain it,\" per its description.\n\nStevens plays a character known only as \"German Scientist.\" It also stars Michael Biehn, Drew Starkey, Rebecca Hall (another Wingard favorite), and Alex Pereira.\n\nIn \"Primetime,\" Robert Pattinson will play a TV journalist heavily inspired by \"Dateline's\" Chris Hansen. It will be the feature debut for documentarian Lance Oppenheim.\n\nIt also stars Phoebe Bridgers, Merritt Wever, Sean Bridgers, Skyler Gisondo, and Matthew Maher.\n\nKeanu Reeves, Kirsten Dunst, Daniel Brühl, Samantha Morton, Nicholas Braun, Tobias Menzies, and Connor Swindells are set to star in director Ruben Östlund's follow-up to \"The Triangle of Sadness.\"\n\n\"The Entertainment System Is Down\" is a story about (gasp) what happens on a long-haul flight when the plane's entertainment system is down.\n\nDeadline reported in August 2024 that \"The Holdovers\" star Dominic Sessa had been tapped to play iconic chef and personality Anthony Bourdain.\n\nThe film will also star Antonio Banderas, Emilia Jones, Leo Woodall, and Stavros Halkias, and will be directed by Matt Johnson, who was last behind the camera for \"BlackBerry\" and \"Nirvanna the Band the Show the Movie.\"\n\nEisenberg was announced to be directing a musical by Deadline in November 2024.\n\nIt's said to follow \"a shy woman who is unexpectedly cast in a local production of an original musical\" while working with a \"strong-willed and enigmatic director\" in a community theater production, Deadline reported.\n\nIt's set to star Julianne Moore and Paul Giamatti as the shy woman and director, respectively, along with Halle Bailey, Havana Rose Liu, Bernadette Peters, Bonnie Milligan, and Lilli Cooper.",

    "description": "Nail artists say that the clean-girl aesthetic is here to stay, but look out for the rise of maximalist designs, like polka dots and florals, in 2026.",
    "fullText": "As beauty trends continue to cycle — with some overstaying their welcome and others still vying for a spot on everyone's social media feed — it can be hard to know what's \"in.\"\n\nSo, Business Insider spoke with four nail artists about which manicures are worth spending your beauty budget on this year, and which designs should be left in 2025.\n\nCelebrity manicurist and educator Julie Kandalec told Business Insider that aura nails — defined by a soft, diffused type of color gradient with the lightest shade in the middle — surrounded by an outline will add a pop to your manicure.\n\nTogether, these details create a sharp juxtaposition that's very eye-catching.\n\nShades of blue are usually a popular choice for January, celebrity nail tech Erica De Los Santos said, recommending the shade Blue Moon Bloom from Gelish to start the year.\n\nBut don't expect the excitement for blue hues to fade. Celebrity manicurist and CEO of Nailing Hollywood, Mazz Hanna, said to keep an eye out for Gelcare's Cobalt Blue as a trending color for 2026.\n\nAnother trend for nail art this year is cooler-toned colors, Kandalec said, offering examples like metallics, including silvers and gunmetals, as well as some shades of pink.\n\nShe added that the trend will also extend to colors of cat-eye polishes, which use a magnet to move small particles of metal to create a shimmering, reflective finish.\n\nThough cat-eye nails aren't new to the nail-art world, Kandalec said the trend is continuing to grow internationally and will remain popular throughout the year.\n\nCelebrity nail artist Sonya Meesh told BI that polka dots are incredibly popular and will continue to trend throughout 2026.\n\n\"It's a chic pattern. It's something that anybody can do,\" they said, adding, \"I want people to be excited and have some fun with their nails.\"\n\nChocolate-brown shades have been popular for a while, so it's no surprise they'll be sticking around this year.\n\nFrom deeper shades to lighter, Hershey Kiss-inspired hues, chocolate-brown nail colors, like Stellar Gel's Mocha Latte and Lights Lacquer's Americano, will be big throughout 2026, Kandalec said.\n\n\"We are definitely bringing the natural, clean nail in 2026,\" Meesh said, adding that as more people start to maintain their nails at home, it's an easier look to achieve.\n\nDesigns like soap nails, which use soft pinks to accentuate your natural nail bed color, make for easy at-home maintenance and manicure longevity.\n\nAlthough the clean-girl aesthetic is sticking around, Hanna said maximalism is making its comeback.\n\n\"I can see really wild, out-there nail art becoming really trendy,\" she said, including intricate florals, polka dots, and layered patterns.\n\nThanks to advancements in technology, there are also so many different gel polishes to use for designs, from velvet and sheer jelly to cat-eye. So, Hanna predicts another facet of maximalist designs will be using these elements together to blend aesthetics.\n\nAs enchanting as chrome nails can look, Hanna predicts the style will fall out of favor in 2026.\n\nOne of the main issues with chrome is its lack of longevity.\n\n\"Unless you're going to somebody who's highly, highly skilled with applying it using the right products, it's hard to make it last,\" she said.\n\nAnother issue with chrome is the cost.\n\n\"Usually, when you're getting a chrome manicure, it's expensive,\" Hana said. \"I think people are trying to stretch their dollar as much as they can these days.\"\n\nStiletto-shaped nails (long nails that come to a pointed tip) can create fun, dramatic looks. But at the end of the day, they're not always practical.\n\nAchieving the proper shape often requires enhancements, like Gel-X extensions, to provide the necessary structure for the nail to hold, Kandalec said.\n\nIf done incorrectly, the structural integrity of the nail can be compromised, potentially causing serious damage and pain to the natural nail.\n\nNeon colors tend to spike in popularity during the summer, but for 2026, you can say \"no\" to the trend altogether.\n\nThis year, Kandalec said, is all about soft and luxurious styles.\n\nDe Los Santos also said neons are out, instead pointing to bright colors, like Barbie pink, as an on-trend alternative.",

    "title": "I left my full-time job at 50 and moved to Mexico. The savings were great — and the reinvention was even better.",
    "description": "Early retirement at 50 became possible when I left the United States and moved to a wonderful town in Mexico. The cost of living and pros are great.",
    "fullText": "Retiring at 50 sounded dreamy, but the rising costs of living in San Francisco made that seem unattainable.\n\nEarly retirement in the US felt like too risky of a move, even if I moved to a more affordable city since health-insurance costs alone — especially if I faced a serious diagnosis — could quickly eat up my savings.\n\nSo I expanded my research overseas, looking for a place to life that would feel safe, inspiring, and, of course, affordable. I still wanted to be able to visit my family regularly, so it also couldn't be too far from San Francisco.\n\nOne day, as I described my frustration in finding the perfect place to retire, a friend recommended Ajijic, Mexico, citing its favorable weather, rich culture, and natural beauty. It's also just a four-hour flight (plus a short drive) from San Francisco.\n\nThough I was concerned about the language barrier — I speak only a little Spanish — he assured me that English was widely spoken there.\n\nAs I looked more into Ajijic, I realized it could be an ideal place for me to retire. It's a popular spot for expats from the US, Canada, and beyond and the Mexican government even designated it a \"magic town\" because of its high marks regarding culture, heritage, and infrastructure.\n\nSo, in 2023, I quit my job, packed two suitcases, and flew across the border to start the next chapter of my life.\n\nIt didn't take long for this lakeside town 5,000 feet above sea level with a population of about 11,000 people to win me over. For starters, its subtropical climate stays mild and comfortable most of the year.\n\nThe town sits on the dreamy shore of Lake Chapala, Mexico's largest natural lake. It's also surrounded by the foothills of the Sierra Madre, a mountain range full of hiking trails.\n\nIt's truly a beautiful place, and I love watching the sunrise over the lake from my rooftop, listening to roosters announce the new day.\n\nAjijic is also famous for its cultural activities — there are art shows, concerts, and festivals all year round. My favorite, the carnival before Lent, fills the streets with colorful floats, school bands, and men in funny wooden masks dancing in the tradition of the Sayacos.\n\nThere are plenty of restaurants to choose from in town and, at night, live music spills into the streets, making evening strolls all the more delightful.\n\nGenerally, I've seen two-bedroom rentals in Ajijic cost about $1,000 a month — about a third of the prices I'd been finding in San Francisco.\n\nMy monthly utility costs, including internet and phone, dropped from about $350 to $110. Dinner at a decent restaurant is about $20 per person here, whereas I used to spend about $60 dining out back home.\n\nBefore moving to Ajijic, my biggest worry was healthcare access. So far, my experiences here have put my mind at ease.\n\nIn 2023, I was quoted $12,000 for two tooth implants and a bone graft in San Francisco, even with insurance coverage. In Ajijic, I paid about $2,600 without insurance.\n\nHere, a semi-recent trip to the emergency room for a fall, including a consultation, X-ray, and a splint, cost me less than $150. Even with insurance, I'd expect to pay at least triple that amount for a similar visit back home.\n\nThanks to savings such as these, I'm living comfortably long before Social Security kicks in.\n\nI moved to Mexico for financial freedom, but the bigger reward has been the reinvention that's come with retiring early here.\n\nWith more time on my hands, I began gardening and painting murals in my backyard — hobbies I'd wanted to explore for years.\n\nSince moving to Ajijic, I've finished writing two novels, started screenwriting, and even won a partial scholarship to a writers' retreat in France. I spent two weeks driving through the French countryside, something I'd never imagined.\n\nInspired by the creative drive, I auditioned at a local theater and was cast in a play. Acting had been my childhood passion, and returning to the stage after college brought that dream back to life.\n\nOver the past two years, I've joined an improv troupe, performed at community events, and even sung with a local band.\n\nRetiring in Mexico has done more than stretch my budget — surrounded by Ajijic's cobblestone streets and bougainvillea-draped walls, I've been pushed to live a richer life with even more possibilities.",

    "description": "USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, a defense official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Two US Navy destroyers helped American forces chase down, board, and ultimately seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after a weekslong chase across the ocean, a defense official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, initially called Bella 1, on Wednesday, the official said.\n\nThe official declined to provide additional details about the warships' role in the seizure, citing operational security concerns.\n\nThe destroyers' involvement in the mission, which also included the Coast Guard and special operations forces, highlights the scale of the US military's efforts to capture the oil tanker, on the run since it evaded a naval blockade. Flight-tracking data showed various aircraft were airborne either shortly before or during the operation.\n\nThe UK government said it supported the operation with a tanker and Royal Air Force surveillance aircraft. A NATO official told Business Insider that the alliance's standing naval forces were not involved.\n\nBella 1, which has been described by the Trump administration as a \"dark fleet\" tanker operating in violation of sanctions, evaded a US naval blockade of sanctioned vessels near Venezuela last month and avoided attempts by the American military to board the vessel.\n\nThe tanker, sailing under the flag of Guyana, then fled north into the Atlantic, reflagged as a Russian vessel, and changed its name to the Marinera. On the run, the crew even painted the country's tricolor on the hull.\n\nThe Coast Guard pursued the tanker for weeks. The unusual chase ended on Wednesday when American forces seized the vessel in waters about halfway between the UK and Iceland.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that because the vessel had a judicial seizure order, the ship's crew is \"subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution if necessary.\"\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the seizure and said that threats to prosecute the tanker's crew \"are entirely unacceptable,\" the state-owned news agency Tass reported on Thursday.\n\nSeparately, the US military said that it seized another sanctioned tanker — M/T Sophia — near the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday after it was \"conducting illicit activities\" in the region.\n\nThe back-to-back interdictions mark the latest in a string of vessel seizures that have occurred since the US announced last month that a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela was going into effect.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the two tankers that were seized on Wednesday had either \"last docked\" in Venezuela or were sailing to the country.\n\n\"The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday after the operations. \"Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce — as determined by the US — will be permitted.\"\n\nThe US naval blockade was set up as part of a pressure campaign against Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, whom the US had long accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity, allegations he denies.\n\nThe campaign also included a massive US military buildup in the Caribbean that began in August. American forces carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats over the following months, as President Donald Trump threatened to take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated over the weekend, when the US staged a dramatic surprise operation to capture Maduro. American forces who raided his compound in Caracas were supported by more than 150 military aircraft.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has threatened additional action against other countries near Venezuela, including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico.",

Shares of top contractors clawed back losses from Wednesday's session spurred by Trump's statement that he would ban defense companies from issuing dividends and stock buybacks unless military production and maintenance are enhanced.\n\nHere were the big movers Thursday morning:\n\nThe White House declined to comment further.\n\nThe strength of the US military has long been a key focus for Trump, but his attention on the US military has sharpened after the US conducted its raid on Venezuela and captured the nation's president this month. This week, Trump also revived the idea that the US could take over Greenland, with the administration weighing options including the use of the military to acquire the territory from Denmark.",

    "description": "Trump targeted two sectors in his latest attacks: single-family homes and defense contractors.",
    "fullText": "Home is where the heart is, but not where the institutional investors are.\n\nAt least, that's President Donald Trump's proposed plan. In a post on Truth Social, he said he's \"immediately\" taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nIt was one of two attacks the president issued on the business world. The other targeted a group familiar with crosshairs: defense contractors.\n\nTrump said he would \"not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or do stock buybacks until they sped up production. He also criticized industry executives' \"exorbitant and unjustifiable\" compensation packages.\n\nBlackstone, a large institutional investor in residential real estate, and defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies were among the companies that saw their share prices immediately drop following the posts.\n\nFor Trump, it's in line with a new form of capitalism he's ushered in during his second term. One with more government involvement in the private sector, including taking individual stakes in companies, as BI's Emily Stewart previously covered. (You can also see my ugly mug discussing the idea here.)\n\nIt's a topic we're focusing on this year at BI with our series, \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nThe intention behind Trump's latest attacks seems squarely focused on his biggest opponent these days: affordability.\n\nFrom houses to groceries to everything in between, rising prices have been a real thorn in Trump's side. The president has maintained he inherited these problems from his predecessor, but that hasn't softened the blow for some Americans.\n\nOn paper, going after institutional investors in the housing market is the perfect antidote. The real-estate market has been a mess the past few years, and frustrated home buyers love to blame Wall Street.\n\nIn reality, it's not that clear-cut, as BI's James Rodriguez has previously reported.\n\nOne analysis from October 2023 found investors with at least 1,000 units in their portfolio owned just 0.73% of all single-family homes in the US. However, regions like the southeast have a more concentrated number of institutional investors.\n\nStill, the housing shortage is more likely the reason you can't find, or afford, your dream home. Trump didn't mention anything about institutional investors having to sell the houses they already own. And even if you want to, you can't really yell at boomers to start selling theirs.",

    "title": "I regret not practicing gentle parenting with my oldest kids. I'm making up for lost time now.",
    "description": "I raised my kids the old-school way for years before gentle parenting showed me a better way — and cleared up a big misconception.",
    "fullText": "I always envisioned myself being a tough-but-loving \"old school\" parent.\n\nBut now that I'm older — and wiser — I can look back and see how my parenting has evolved over the years. As I learned more about child development and psychology, I evolved from a more traditional approach to parenting to a gentler one. Now I wish I had been more gentle when my two oldest kids were younger.\n\nToday, I'm doing what feels best to me. For example, I don't actually need to punish my child for wasting their entire allowance on an item. The natural consequence is that they don't have spending money for the rest of that month until it's allowance time again.\n\nAllowing my kids to learn from their decisions and experiences is something I now value, and it has become a significant part of how I parent my four children: two teenagers, an almost-teen, and a 9-year-old.\n\nLet me be clear, gentle parenting does not mean that kids are spoiled and have no consequences, as I once thought.\n\nGentle parenting is primarily about supporting kids through their challenges, allowing natural consequences, and being a source of guidance rather than fear. Who wouldn't want that?\n\nMy husband and I were both raised in homes that practiced the old-school style of parenting. When our oldest two children were young, we continued what we knew as parenting, leaning on \"my way or the highway\" and \"because I said so\" approaches.\n\nNo one in my circles had really heard of gentle parenting when my now-teens were young. We began to shift from old school parenting to what's known in the adoption community as connective and trauma-informed parenting when our second child was a toddler, and our oldest was about 4. Since none of our children are biologically ours, all adopted at birth, we learned that many adoptees are born with trauma due to separation from their biological parents. We also learned the idea that connecting with kids, that is, building a strong relationship with them that's based on trust and choice, before offering any correction, whether that be natural consequences or verbal guidance, could be highly effective.\n\nThe idea is that fear-based parenting doesn't foster a strong parent-child relationship and maintains a dynamic where children only take action out of fear of punishment, which may include the parent's anger expressed through silent treatment, yelling, or harsh criticism. This only works for so long because kids get older, bigger, stronger, and have more freedoms. This thinking resonated with us.\n\nMy husband and I want our kids to develop skills, such as empathy and emotional maturity. To do so, I know they need amazing role models. They also need the freedom to make mistakes while among safe people in safe environments.\n\nI believe that when parents take the time to work on themselves, the relationship we have with our children can flourish rather than be built on an unhealthy power dynamic that eventually crumbles. Understanding this has improved my relationship with my kids.\n\nReflecting on our own upbringing can be challenging and, frankly, emotionally draining work, but I have found myself reflecting with empathy. Our parents did the best they could with the resources available to them at the time. Some experts at the time recommended spanking as an effective form of discipline. We know better now, so, as Maya Angelou once put it, we have chosen to do better.\n\nI also had to overcome the misconception that gentle parenting is permissive parenting. When some dedicated, old-school parents learn that we prioritize connective (or gentle) parenting, they believe that more traditional parenting prepares a child for the real world, requires them to be respectful, and toughens kids up. However, I argue that a gentler, more intentional parenting style raises empathetic, open-minded, problem-solving, and secure children who respect their parents rather than always fearing what their mom or dad will think or how they will react.\n\nAnyone who knows our children sees them for who they are: kind, respectful, inclusive, and willing to use their voices and actions to help others. They have been parented in a way that shows them we value their voice, we respect their point of view, and we see ourselves as guides and encouragers in their lives, also advocating when needed.\n\nGentle doesn't mean passive or permissive. I am still the parent, and my kids are still children for whom I am responsible. However, they are given options, encouraged to problem-solve, and do have consequences for poor choices. They do \"know their place,\" just not in the old school way, but rather, from a place of knowing we always have their back.\n\nI truly believe gentle parenting is changing how kids who are now teens and young adults see themselves and the world. They are able to walk in confidence, knowing they are loved and supported, and they have built the skills they need to tackle challenges.\n\nWhen they do mess up, they can always tell their parents and count on them not to say something along the lines of, \"I told you so.\" Rather, they're met with open arms. That's true respect, and that's what I'm aiming for in my family.",

    "title": "I love making Ina Garten's protein-rich bean soup. It's easy to prepare, and I always have leftovers.",
    "description": "My favorite high-protein soup recipe is from chef Ina Garten. It calls for simple ingredients and is great to prepare for easy weeknight dinners.",
    "fullText": "Once the weather starts to cool down, I'm all about making soups and stews. One of my favorites, which I keep in steady rotation from autumn to early spring, is Ina Garten's Tuscan white bean soup.\n\nThis hearty, nutritious soup is packed with protein and fiber from its main ingredient — cannellini beans. Plus, it's wonderfully flexible and effortless, even for beginner home cooks (like my 14-year-old son, who enjoys helping me make it).\n\nThe best part? When I make this soup for our family of four, there's always leftovers for lunches or an easy next-day dinner.\n\nBefore I start cooking, I gather the ingredients, including white cannellini beans, olive oil, bacon, leeks, yellow onions, carrots, celery, garlic, fresh rosemary, chicken broth, bay leaves, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.\n\nGarten starts with a pound of dried cannellini beans, soaked at least eight hours (or overnight). I can't always find dried cannellini beans in my grocery store, but I usually have the canned version in the pantry, so that's what I use.\n\nPer Garten's directions, I grab two 14-ounce cans of cannellini beans, drain them, and keep the liquid on the side.\n\nThen, I grab a cup of the beans and ½ cup of the liquid and puree the mixture with my immersion blender. The rest of the beans are used whole.\n\nGarten's recipe calls for 4 ounces of diced pancetta, but I typically use bacon instead.\n\nIn my soup pot, I heat ¼ cup of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat and cook the bacon until it's browned and just a little crisp around the edges.\n\nWhile the bacon is browning, my son and I chop the vegetables.\n\nI love this part of the process because it's when my kitchen starts to smell delicious.\n\nFollowing the recipe, I add 2 cups of chopped leeks (both the white and light green parts), 2 cups of chopped yellow onion, 2 cups of diced carrots, 2 cups of diced celery, 2 tablespoons of minced garlic, and 2 teaspoons of minced fresh rosemary to the pot.\n\nI cook all the chopped vegetables with the bacon for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until everything starts to soften and smell amazing.\n\nOnce the vegetables and herbs have softened, I add in the pureed beans, the whole drained beans, 6 cups of chicken broth (you'll want to use 8 cups if you're using dried beans), two bay leaves, a tablespoon of salt, and a teaspoon of pepper.\n\nAlthough Garten recommends using homemade chicken stock, I've found boxed chicken broth works just fine.\n\nAnother perk of using canned beans instead of dried is that the soup doesn't have to simmer as long. Once the soup comes to a boil, I lower the heat and let it simmer for 45 minutes, partially covered.\n\nIf I were to use dried beans instead, it would take about 90 minutes to simmer.\n\nThe recipe suggests taking the soup off the heat 15 minutes before serving to allow it to thicken a bit. If it's thicker than I like (which isn't usually an issue when I use canned beans), I'll splash in a little more broth or water.\n\nThen, it's time to remove the bay leaves and ladle the soup into bowls. Before enjoying, I add some freshly grated Parmesan, a drizzle of olive oil, and a little extra crumbled bacon.\n\nThis soup stands on its own as a complete meal, but I usually serve it with cheesy garlic bread or grilled cheese.\n\nThe standard recipe makes about six to eight servings, which is plenty for my family. But if I'm having guests over or want extra leftovers, I simply double the recipe.",

    "description": "Peter Boockvar cautioned investors against \"blindly\" relying on tech stocks to power their portfolios, and advised looking at other parts of the market.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street remains bullish on AI, but the investment chief of a $12 billion firm thinks investors need to be careful not to pin all of their hopes on the technology.\n\nPeter Boockvar, the chief investment officer of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners, thinks greater opportunities lie outside of the AI trade despite the stellar gains it delivered for the market in 2025.\n\nMany of the tech sector's most dominant players, including Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, have stumbled out of the gate in 2026. Boockvar says the industry's previous growth isn't sustainable and that its days of dominance are numbered.\n\nIn his view, the AI trade won't function as the market-driving force that investors have come to know in recent years. While there will still be growth opportunities, being selective will be of much greater importance.\n\n\"Investors need to not just blindly rely on that AI tech trade as the leadership group, and understand that there are a lot of other parts of the market that can do well now.\"\n\nThe CIO said on CNBC that he believes market tides are slowly shifting in a direction that doesn't favor prominent AI stocks. In his view, the market has been showing signs of fatigue that some investors may be ignoring.\n\n\"I do think in 2026 the AI tech trade is losing some steam in terms of its dominance,\" he said. \"We've seen the market response to Nvidia's report a couple of months ago. We've seen the market punish Meta for its excessive spending.\"\n\nBoockvar pointed to the struggles of other top AI companies like Oracle, whose lackluster Q3 earnings prompted concerns of AI overspending, and also flagged CoreWeave, a stock that surged 90% in 2025 but still drew consistent concerns of excessive debt and potential lack of profitability.\n\n\"I think that entire trade is becoming more differentiated, that we've reached a point where investors are realizing they're going to be winners and they're going to be losers,\" Boockvar added.\n\nBoockvar highlighted surging capex in 2025 as part of his bearish thesis for this year, arguing that companies should diversify their spending beyond data centers.\n\n\"All the capex growth in 2025 was the data center building\" he said. \"Hopefully in 2026, with the tax incentives in terms of immediate expense, other parts of the economy can take that baton.\"",

    "fullText": "Kim Farrell, TikTok's global head of creators, is leaving the company, Business Insider has learned.\n\nFarrell joined TikTok nearly six years ago, starting on the company's Latin America marketing team before shifting to its operations division and later taking over as global creator lead in late 2023. In December, she helped organize TikTok's first awards show for creators at the Hollywood Palladium theater in Los Angeles. Prior to TikTok, Farrell worked in marketing at Booking.com and Google.\n\nHer departure was announced internally on Wednesday, as the company informed staff that it was reorganizing its content division, which includes employees who work with creators, publishers, and other content partners. As part of the reorg, the company is merging its creator and publisher teams into one and letting go of 20 US staffers and some other roles globally. Business Insider was unable to learn the full count of global job cuts.\n\n\"We are realigning our global content operations team as we continue to accelerate the growth of high-quality content and key content verticals,\" a TikTok spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nMedia publisher Status earlier reported on the layoffs.\n\nFarrell's exit follows a string of executive shake-ups and reorgs across TikTok over the past year and a half.\n\nTikTok Shop US operations lead Nico Le Bourgeois left the company in May. Blake Chandlee, TikTok's advertising leader, stepped down in March as part of a reorg that put the sales team under the oversight of its global monetization product technology division. TikTok's global head of marketing, Kate Jhaveri, left the company in September 2024. Some of the company's reorgs have shifted power away from local leaders toward executives based in China or Singapore, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nTikTok's content team reorg comes at a moment of flux for the video platform.\n\nCEO Shou Chew told workers in December that it plans to spin off parts of its US business in a joint venture with an investor group that includes tech company Oracle and investment firms Silver Lake and MGX. The new entity will have oversight over some aspects of the business like data security, but key business lines like e-commerce and advertising will remain under TikTok's global owner, ByteDance, according to Chew's memo. The US product is supposed to remain interoperable with the rest of the world.\n\nThe deal is expected to close later this month, Chew said in the memo.",

    "description": "About 15 years ago, I moved to a small town in Florida, three hours from where I grew up in Miami. Living this far from my hometown has been great.",
    "fullText": "Nearly 15 years ago, I moved to a small town on Florida's Space Coast, about three hours away from where I grew up in Miami.\n\nI hadn't planned to move out of the city forever, but I've since fallen in love with my quieter, slower pace of life. Fortunately, I'm not too far from where I grew up — and I've never stopped going back to Miami for visits a few times a year.\n\nI don't regret moving, and it turns out that living just a short drive from home comes with a lot of perks.\n\nAt first, returning to Miami after having just moved away felt so different.\n\nI'd been feeling pretty homesick, and I didn't immediately embrace small-town living in my new slice of Florida. However, once I was back home, I realized I felt most like myself in Miami — something I doubt I'd ever have noticed if I had never left.\n\nThat said, moving away ultimately helped me better understand myself and how my values have been shaped.\n\nFor instance, I forget how much everyday can feel like a party in Miami until I go back, and then I see that lively city is where I get the perspective that life should be celebrated.\n\nI've realized that even though I've left Miami, I can carry some of my favorite parts of the city with me wherever I go — and that's been really empowering.\n\nFor example, one of the things I miss most about Miami is its incredible Cuban food scene. I've yet to find anything as good where I live now, so I've learned how to make many of my favorite Cuban dishes at home.\n\nWith Cuban food being so accessible and affordable in Miami, I likely never would've learned how to cook any of it on my own if I still lived there.\n\nAnd, whenever I'm back in Miami, I still always stop at all of my favorite restaurants that just can't quite be replicated anywhere else.\n\nAll of my closest friends and some family members still live in Miami, so when I visit, I really get to spend a lot of time with whoever I'm staying with.\n\nWhile I'm often sad that we don't live close by and can't see each other all the time, I probably spend more quality time with them now than I did when I lived there.\n\nIn some ways, it's easier to see someone when it requires a bit of intentional planning, and you can't just pop by each other's homes anytime.\n\nSince I'm no longer a local, I get to see the city from a new perspective. I've loved experiencing the restaurants, nightlife, and beaches as visitors do — it's truly an energetic and unique place.\n\nI've noticed things that I didn't even realize I missed, such as driving around specific parts of Miami. I get to see how things are changing, but even places that have been there my whole life somehow seem more novel to me now.\n\nSince I've moved away, I've become more appreciative of certain things back home, particularly the food and my friendships.\n\nI feel really lucky to live just a short drive from the city I grew up in, which also happens to be a really fun place to visit. I'm aware that if home were a plane ride away, I definitely wouldn't be able to visit as often.\n\nWhen I'm there, I get to remember who I am and where I come from. However, I also get to see where I grew up in a new light, almost as if I were an outsider experiencing something for the first time.\n\nI was never really proud of being from Miami when I lived there, but now that I've sort of seen it as a tourist, I have a newfound pride for where I'm from.",

    "description": "Moving to Europe was life-changing for Natalie Lynch. While her move has been mostly positive, it has come with a couple of downsides.",
    "fullText": "Like many Americans, Natalie Lynch had a wake-up call during the pandemic. She'd been working since she was 15, and after decades in real estate — first as a home stager and later as an agent — she was burned out, lonely, and desperate for a change.\n\nIn 2021, she sold her home in Oakland, California. A few years later, she sold the home-staging business she'd owned for 24 years. But the high cost of living in the Bay Area was still draining her savings, and she was unsatisfied.\n\n\"I honestly never thought that I would leave,\" Lynch, 56, told Business Insider. But after four decades, she did. \"I just didn't find it sustainable anymore.\"\n\nIn 2024, Lynch traded the American dream for Europe, packing up her life and moving with her dog, Enzo, to Italy. They spent a couple of months traveling the coast before heading to Spain, and ultimately settled in Audenge, a small town in southwestern France near Arcachon Bay, along the Bordeaux coast.\n\n\"It was a huge leap to push myself out of my comfort zone,\" Lynch said. \"I had owned my home for 17 years and was surrounded by a great support system of friends and neighbors, but I was in search of a new life.\"\n\nHere are Lynch's five pros and cons of starting a new life in a foreign country.\n\nAfter selling her Oakland home, Lynch was renting a 1,000-square-foot 1980s condo for $3,000 a month in California. Now in Audenge, she's renting a fully furnished duplex that comes with a small pool for €1,200 a month, which is about $1,400, including utilities.\n\nShe said her monthly budget in Audenge for food and other day-to-day expenses is about $1,000. Roughly $600 goes toward recurring costs, including car insurance, storage for her belongings in Antwerp, Belgium, and services like her phone plan and Netflix.\n\n\"Life is definitely more affordable here compared to California,\" she said.\n\nUnlike couples who move abroad together, Lynch doesn't have a built-in companion other than Enzo.\n\nShe has to go out of her way to make connections, whether through expat groups on social media or simply by walking to her local café or restaurant.\n\n\"It's definitely doable, but in the beginning, it's definitely lonely by yourself,\" she said. \"I think it's because I haven't settled anywhere yet.\"\n\n\"I think it's the same with any move to any place,\" she added. \"You need to get established and start meeting people. I've definitely made some great friends in my travels, but they're just not all in one place.\"\n\nLynch said Europeans rely far less on credit, aren't flashy with luxury cars, and tend to be more modest about their appearance.\n\n\"People here are less focused on the small stuff, and more focused on quality of life and living within their means,\" she said.\n\n\"In California, I was surrounded by Teslas. I was getting my hair dyed every four weeks, getting gel nails, and spending an obligatory $300 every time I went to Target,\" she added. \"Here, women are aging gracefully, and it's a relief. You see a lot more silver hair and little to no fillers.\"\n\nShe said it has made it easier to be intentional about how she spends her money.\n\nA big challenge for many expats or migrants is navigating another country's bureaucracy. Imagine going to the DMV in a place where you don't speak the language — or trying to apply for residency or health coverage without knowing where to go or who to talk to.\n\n\"A lot of people, including French people, say the bureaucracy is especially complicated here,\" Lynch said. \"I haven't had too much experience with it, except when I tried to register my dog, Enzo.\"\n\nShe said she accidentally left out required documents for Enzo's registration and got a curt email from the official processing the paperwork, which left a bad taste in her mouth.\n\nBack in California, Lynch's typical day running her home-staging business began around 8 a.m. with calls about problems she needed to solve, and it sometimes ended around 10 p.m. with more phone calls.\n\n\"When you work at a certain stress level — and a lot of people do — it just becomes normal,\" she said. \"You deal with it, but it's not good for our nervous systems at all. Being in Europe, in general, has reset my nervous system back to baseline.\"\n\nWith lower living costs and no job, Lynch said she no longer feels like she's working just to survive. These days, she can wake up when she wants, and she often spends her free time taking Enzo on small day trips to nearby towns.\n\n\"I feel way less stressed,\" she said. Her biggest worries now are taking care of Enzo and figuring out where she'll live next when her lease is up.",

    "title": "Tailwind lays off 75% of its 4-person engineering team, citing 'brutal impact AI has had on our business'",
    "description": "Tailwind's CEO said that while AI made the web tool more popular, it also led to cratering revenue and difficulty converting paid users.",
    "fullText": "Tailwind laid off 75% of the startup's engineering staff on Monday — and its CEO blames AI.\n\n\"75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business,\" CEO Adam Wathan wrote in a GitHub comment that has made waves in the tech community.\n\nTailwind, like many startups, has a small head count. In a podcast posted on X, Wathan said that the company had four engineers on staff. Now, there's one.\n\nWathan's post highlights the challenges that startups, which already face tough odds of success, can encounter as AI models grow more capable.\n\nThe CEO founded the web developer tool in 2017. Tailwind's model is free and open-source, with a paid \"pro\" tier driving the company's revenue. In his GitHub comment, Wathan wrote that AI was making Tailwind more popular, but slimming its base of paid customers.\n\nTraffic to Tailwind's online documentation has seen a 40% decrease, Wathan wrote. Those resources were where people learned about the paid tier, the CEO wrote, crushing its ability to make money. Revenue is down 80%, he added.\n\nThe remaining team after the layoffs is the three owners, one engineer, and one part-time employee, the CEO said. \"That's all the resources we have,\" he said.\n\n🎧 Recorded a new morning walk this morning, hard one to share because I'm sure people will want to roast me for it but have been transparent up until now so publishing it anyways. pic.twitter.com/lslaLp2gtf\n\nWathan said he spent the holidays forecasting revenue and realized that the situation was \"significantly worse than I realized.\" The decline in revenue has occurred over several years, Wathan said, but it was gradual. If nothing changed, Wathan said his forecasting showed that Tailwind would not be able to meet payroll in six months.\n\nThe layoffs were a \"brutal decision,\" Wathan said. \"If we didn't do it now, then we we not be able to give people generous severance packages,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel like a failure for having to do it,\" Wathan said. \"It's not good.\"\n\nTailwind is popular among developers, and Wathan's post sparked reactions from the tech community on social media, some of which blamed the CEO for the company's revenue decline.\n\nOne X user wrote that they had only received five promotional emails from Tailwind in 2025. \"We don't send enough email,\" Wathan responded. \"Definitely need to get better at it.\"\n\nAnother X user wrote that Tailwind relied on a business model of selling UI components, while free and AI-generated equivalents grew.\n\n\"Still to this day don't know what we should be pivoting to, so in the mean time it's only made sense to do what's at least working a little,\" Wathan responded.\n\nIn his podcast, Wathan said that 90% of people understood and didn't \"pile on,\" but others did. He carried the burden that, as an employer, the world \"hates you and thinks you're evil,\" he said.\n\nOthers voiced their support online. Dropbox and Groupon alum Josh Puckett called the podcast an \"incredibly raw, honest take from one of our industry's best on the realities of running a business in the midst of the creative destruction AI is bringing.\"\n\nAI's ability to summarize and extract information, sometimes without directing users to specific sites or documents, is threatening many businesses reliant on online traffic. The media industry is well aware of this, as a crop of startups has formed around the concept of \"Google Zero.\"\n\nThat's basically what happened to Tailwind. It needed traffic to convert free users into paying customers, its CEO said, and AI effectively crushed that traffic. Still, Wathan remains hopeful for the company's future.\n\n\"I'm still optimistic,\" he said in his podcast. \"My job requires me to be optimistic.\"",

    "description": "When I learned my son started dating, I knew it was time for the sex talk. I worried I didn't have the proper, up-to-date information, so I struggled.",
    "fullText": "An impromptu inspection of my oldest son's phone revealed some shocking information: He has started dating.\n\nWhile my wife and I were both delighted to find out our 12-year-old was growing up and exploring the dating pool, it also made us both realize how negligent we had been about keeping up with health and sex education. That's when we immediately sat him down for \"The Talk\" — the sex talk.\n\nAs we sat at the kitchen table, the remains of dinner still in the kitchen and our teenager looking more awkward and uncomfortable by the minute, it made me wonder: Were we too late?\n\nI think I neglected sex education for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, my son only recently started showing interest in dating. One day, he's covering his eyes and groaning when actors kiss in movies and shows, and the next, he's dating a girl. We had assumed the change would arrive gradually, and instead, like so many parents, we were ambushed by puberty.\n\nSecondly, memories of my own sex education were making me unsure about how to handle my current situation as a parent. My mother was a nurse, so sex education was delivered by way of awkward health videos, lectures, and books that broke down the intermingling of human anatomy with bland drawings.\n\nI also spent a lot of time with my church's youth group and was exposed to abstinence-only material. While I've always viewed abstinence as a valid option, abstinence-only education purposely neglects all the many other concerns and challenges that come from being sexually active.\n\nWhile my church-approved sex education did a lot of work to sell the joys of sex after marriage, it did nothing to address the challenges of pregnancies, STDs, and the uneven social and gender implications surrounding the act.\n\nSo, I didn't really have a clue how to broach the subject with my kid.\n\nI feel I know more than the average white heterosexual man, but becoming a parent tested my confidence, especially since kids today are facing new challenges.\n\nMy teenage son is actively swimming in the dating pool, and my advice is more than a couple of decades out of date. For example, is the old trick about bananas and condoms still a good visual aid?\n\nI've been married for 21 years, so I can only imagine what has changed.\n\nI made trips to the library for additional information and visual aids (I'd recommend \"It's Perfectly Normal\" by Robie H. Harris as a starting point), and I reacquainted myself with sex-positive writers and educators who provided more information to me as a parent.\n\nAs it turned out, \"The Talk\" has turned into multiple talks as new questions were posed. Since he was already dating, we had to start with the basics about STDs and pregnancies before moving on to the social challenges of displays of affection and appropriate levels of contact.\n\nWe faced all these conversations with honest and open minds — awkwardness be damned.\n\nHe listened and learned a lot, ultimately deciding to focus on school and extracurricular activities for the time being.\n\nThat's when I realized it's never too late to have the sex talk.",

    "description": "Mark...",
    "fullText": "Trump’s attack on Venezuela illustrates fossil fuels’ many perils.\n\n“Petrostate” is a term usually applied to countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, or Nigeria, where the production and, crucially, the export of oil and gas are fundamental to the domestic economy and foreign policy. Rarely, however, is the term applied to the world’s oldest, richest, and mightiest petro-state. That distinction belongs to the United States, which a few days ago attacked a fellow petro-state, Venezuela, with the announced aim of seizing control of its oil operations. Oil is clearly at the heart of the Venezuela story, which means that climate change is as well.\n\nAlthough most coverage has neglected the climate angle, a Guardian article published on January 6 offered an illuminating exception. Noting that Venezuela holds the world’s largest known oil reserves, The Guardian reported that “even raising production to 1.5m barrels of oil a day from current levels of around 1m barrels would produce…more carbon pollution than what is emitted annually by major economies such as the UK and Brazil,” citing University of California, Santa Barbara, professor Paasha Mahdavi. That, Mahdavi said, would be “terrible for the climate.”\n\nThe United States has been a petro-state since long before Donald Trump came to power, under Democratic and Republican presidents alike. It was under Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden that the United States regained its position as the largest annual producer of oil and exporter of gas. Oil company CEOs populated the cabinets of Republicans George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush (whose family wealth was built on fossil fuels).\n\n“The United States is as much of an OPEC nation as most OPEC nations are.” So said Everett Ehrlich, who chaired the interagency deliberations on climate change in Bill Clinton administration’s, in an interview for my 2010 book, Hot: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth. Ehrlich was explaining why a government that boasted Al Gore as vice president was much more timid about cutting greenhouse gas emissions than its European and Japanese allies were. “The US is more like an OPEC nation—an energy producer—while the Europeans and Japan are energy-consumer nations,” Ehrlich added.\n\nThe United States’ vast oil reserves have been key to its superpower status for more than a century. During World War I, the United States supplied most of the oil that helped Britain and France prevail over Germany. US oil companies have worked alongside the White House, the State Department, and other US agencies ever since, at home via pro-monopoly regulation that pushed prices above free-market levels and abroad via such collaborations as the Red Line Agreement, which in the 1920s gained US companies access to Middle Eastern oil.\n\nDiscoveries of massive deposits in Texas, Oklahoma, and California in the 1930s reinforced the country’s dominance; unlike any of the Axis or Allied powers, the United States had its own oil to fight World War II. Its abundant domestic supply also transformed the US economy after the war, enabling Americans to buy more cars, move to expanding suburbs, and drive on new interstates. Building all those cars, suburbs, and highways propelled a decades-long economic boom that ranks among the most spectacular in human history.\n\nBut the climate crisis underscores a truism about petro-states: Oil can be more a curse than a blessing. Scholars and journalists have documented that most petro-states are plagued by blatant corruption and inequality. Elites grab the revenues; poverty engulfs the masses. Violence is another byproduct: Since 1973, one-fourth to one-half of the world’s wars have been “connected to oil interests,” according to Jeff D. Colgan of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. And, of course, burning oil is a primary driver of climate change.\n\nThe US attack on Venezuela is but the latest example of these destructive tendencies. Journalists need to help audiences understand the attack’s connections to oil, as well as what scientists have long warned: Humanity’s future depends on rapidly phasing out fossil fuels.",

    "fullText": "Google is adding a slate of AI features to Gmail that could save some of the hassle of searching for important information buried in messages and threads. Many users will soon see a more personalized inbox with AI-powered suggestions, summaries, and proofreading support. Plus, some AI functionality that was previously available only to paid subscribers will be rolling out to all Gmail users, including Help Me Write, AI Overviews for threaded emails, and Suggested Replies.\n\nGmail users will soon have an AI Inbox view with two sections. \"Suggested to-dos\" will show immediate action items found in your inbox, such as bills to be paid and appointments to be confirmed. The task will be bolded and followed by a summary and a link to the relevant email or thread. Below that, \"Topics to catch up on\" includes items that are less urgent (but still important), such as order status and event updates.\n\nAI Inbox is an optional toggle in the Gmail side panel. You won't see it immediately, though—the feature is being made available to those in Google's Trusted Tester program before launching for users more broadly \"in the coming months.\"\n\nGoogle AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also be able to get AI Overviews from natural language questions typed into the Gmail search bar (just like a Google search). Instead of a running standard keyword search and clicking through multiple message threads, you'll be able to ask things like “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” and get a detailed summary of information pulled from emails in your inbox. The response will also provide citations to specific threads.\n\nFinally, Gmail will have a built-in, AI-powered proofreading feature that will check grammar, tone, and style and analyze your emails for clarity and structure. Similar to third-party tools like Grammarly, you'll see one-click suggestions for fixing typos, simplifying sentence structure, selecting improving word choice, and making writing more concise.\n\nLike AI Overviews, Proofread will be limited to paid subscribers. Note that these AI features are optional and can be disabled, and Google says it does not use personal information or content to train its AI models.",

    "title": "The Oura Ring Charging Case Is Finally Available",
    "description": "Originally announced in October, it's finally here.",
    "fullText": "Oura has finally answered my biggest (yet perhaps pettiest) complaint about its iconic smart ring—it’s now getting a battery-powered charging case so you can top up the battery when you’re away from your home. The company first announced this back in October, but the charging case is now finally on sale. It's $99 and you need to make sure you order the size that matches your ring size.\n\nThe charging case is specific to the Oura ring 4. If you have a gen 3 ring, there are a few third-party charging cases available, like this one, as well as cases that can house your existing Oura charger of either version, like this one.\n\nAlong with the charging case, Oura's October announcement included new ring colors available in a ceramic finish, and finally, multi-ring support so you can switch between rings. At the same time, Oura also announced Health Panels, a feature that lets you book a blood draw at a Quest lab and view your results in the Oura app. Whoop had previously announced a similar feature, and Ultrahuman launched its Blood Vision earlier in 2025.\n\nIn all the time that I’ve been using Oura rings—since generation 2—the charger has worked the same way: You have a little circular stand that lives on your nightstand, and you set the ring on top of it, fitting it around a little cylinder shape that sticks up from the base. I’ve never loved this format; it’s too easy to send the ring flying if you catch your foot on the cord in the dark. It’s also not the most convenient for travel.\n\nNow, however, the Oura ring has a charging case. The case holds about five charges’ worth of battery, so you can top up the charge on your ring by popping it into the case, then closing the case and sticking it in your pocket. Or gym bag. (Weightlifting workouts are my favorite time to charge the ring.) Traveling with the charger is now simple, and you don’t have to worry about losing the ring if the charger gets knocked over. Other ring brands have been making their own charging cases in the meantime. RingConn comes with a charging case; so does the Luna ring that I'm reviewing now.\n\nNow for the bad news: This puppy is $99, and it’s a separate add-on; you can’t get it in place of the nightstand charger when buying a new ring. Like the nightstand chargers, it’s specific to the size of your ring. For example, you need a size 8 charger for a size 8 ring. The new charging case doesn’t seem to be available on Oura’s website yet, but it should be coming soon. (If you can’t wait, or want to save a few bucks, I found this third-party case that holds your nightstand charger—either generation 3 or 4. It's not as sleek as the official one, though.)\n\nToday Oura announced a new collection of ceramic rings in four different colors: white, navy, pastel green, and pink. The new rings have the same internals as the metallic Ring 4, so this isn’t a new generation of ring, just a new appearance. (Oura also notes that the ceramic rings should be more resistant to scratches, and each one comes with a polishing pad to keep its shine.) All colors are $499, the same price as the gold and rose gold finishes of the regular Ring 4.\n\nWith so many color options, Oura seems to hope existing members will splurge on a second ring. The company is rolling out multi-ring support for the app, another feature I'm surprised they didn’t have before. (When I’ve tested the gen 3 and 4 rings to compare, I've had to completely reset my ring to switch over, or else use two different accounts.) Oura says you’ll need to select in the app which one you’re wearing, so it’s not quite as seamless as the way Garmin or Apple handles multiple devices. (Garmin has me choose a “priority device” and then I can switch at will; Apple just sets you free to swap as you like, and it does its best).\n\nIf you are done with your old ring after upgrading, Oura now has a ring recycling service that gives you a shipping label to send back your old ring. Any Oura ring can be recycled through this program, including old or broken ones. (You should factory-reset the ring first.) Rings you recycle won’t be eligible for returns or refunds.",

    "description": "That $6.99/month Connect+ subscription is finally starting to make sense.",
    "fullText": "Garmin, maker of fitness watches (among other things), announced this week that the subscription tier of the Garmin Connect app will now include nutrition tracking. According to the company, the app can identify foods based on a photo, and can set your calorie targets based on your activity data.\n\nGarmin announced this feature during CES 2026, although a new feature announcement isn't exactly traditional CES fare—I was hoping it would show off a new watch. Still, I did get a chance to try out the feature on my own phone (and watch), and thought it worked well.\n\nGarmin’s nutrition logging is pretty similar to the nutrition logging features on other apps, including my fave free app Cronometer. Identifying food items from a photo is a common feature, but it’s often locked behind a premium tier—which finally makes Garmin’s $6.99/month Connect+ subscription start to make sense. If you were going to pay for a premium nutrition app anyway, or if you already \n\nIf you currently have MyFitnessPal linked to Garmin, you may get a message saying that it’s been disabled. This connection still works, but you can’t use both that and the new nutrition feature—Garmin Connect needs to have one source for nutrition information.\n\nOne nice thing about doing your nutrition in Garmin Connect rather than another app is that the setup process uses your activity history to help you pick a calorie target. This way you don’t have to guess whether you’re “moderately active” versus “lightly active.” Calorie estimates from fitness apps are never totally accurate, but they tend to be a pretty good starting place if you have no idea what number to pick.\n\nThe nutrition feature also allows you to view your calories from your watch, and to log favorite or recent foods. (For a full search, you'll still need to use the app.) This watch feature is available natively on newer watches, and through a ConnectIQ app for slightly older watches—the Forerunner 255 and Fenix 6 are covered with the latter app.",

    "description": "Don't let a bad \"stress score\" stress you out even more.",
    "fullText": "Garmin displays a real-time stress level from 0 to 100. Oura calculates \"daytime stress\" and resilience metrics. For Whoop, it’s the stress monitor; for Fitbit, a \"stress management score.\" However it’s branded, some version of a “stress score” has become ubiquitous across smartwatches and wearables. This number is marketed as a window into our internal emotional state, turned into quantified proof of how our day is really going. The only issue: these numbers aren’t all that accurate.\n\nThe scores lighting up our wrists aren't measuring what most of us think they're measuring. When you check your smartwatch and see that your stress level spiked, you might assume the device somehow detected your anxiety about some direct stimulus, like a difficult conversation or frustrating traffic. But that's not totally accurate.\n\nSure, your watch might have detected physiological arousal—changes in your heart rate variability, skin conductance, or movement patterns. And while those signals do tell us something real about the nervous system, they don't really tell us about stress in the psychological sense you actually care about.\n\n\"Part of the discrepancy can be explained by different definitions of how stress is conceptualized,\" says Eiko Fried, who co-authored a 2025 study that found smartwatch stress measures did not align with self-reported stress scores for most individuals. The way most people understand the term \"stressed\"—as in \"I was really stressed today!\"—isn't the way Garmin defines its stress score, which measures physiological stress. So, your watch is not necessarily telling you how stressed you feel, just how your nervous system is behaving. \"Such elevated activity can come from various sources,\" says Fried, \"including many we would not typically consider a stressful experience.\"\n\nPhysiological arousal shows up in response to all kinds of experiences that have nothing to do with distress. \"What most smartwatches call a 'stress score' isn't stress itself,\" says Erwin van den Burg, a physiologist who specializes in the biology of stress. \"It's usually based on indirect physiological signals like heart rate variability, skin conductance, or movement patterns. Those signals tell us something about arousal in the nervous system, but arousal can come from many sources—physical activity, excitement, caffeine, poor sleep, illness, or emotional engagement—not just psychological stress.\"\n\nThe oversimplification becomes even more problematic when we consider that most stress algorithms fail to account for sex-specific physiology, particularly the menstrual cycle. Because hormonal fluctuations can meaningfully alter heart rate, heart rate variability, and temperature, \"a perfectly healthy physiological shift can be interpreted by a wearable as 'high stress,'\" says Emile Radyte, CEO at Samphire Neuroscience. This means women are more likely to receive misleading stress alerts for standard human biology, which can be confusing at best and anxiety-provoking at worst.\n\nEven setting aside the definition problem and the sex-bias issue, there's a basic question of measurement accuracy.\n\n\"When you have problems with your heart, your cardiologist may ask you to wear a chest-worn device for a few days to monitor your heart rate and heart rate variability. This is a highly accurate medical-grade device,\" Fried says. \"Your doctor will not ask you to wear a smartwatch, because there are many issues that make wrist-worn measurement less reliable. This affects in particular heart rate variability, for which we need highly accurate measurements.\"\n\nHeart rate variability is the cornerstone of most smartwatch stress scores, yet wrist-worn devices struggle to measure it with the precision required for medical-grade insights. The data isn't worthless, but it's noisy, and building definitive claims about internal states on top of noisy data is, well...scientifically dubious.\n\nSo is your wearable useless? Of course not. My critique here isn't that wearables have no value—it's just that the value they provide is being misrepresented. Your smartwatch's \"stress score\" claims to tell you far more than the science really supports. And in some cases, a less-than-ideal score may even increase stress, rather than help people understand what their body is responding to. The great irony of the wellness industry persists.\n\nThe way you think about \"stress\" doesn't translate to a single biological state, let alone one that can be captured by number or \"score.\" Your watch simply detects signs of arousal in your nervous system, which could mean almost anything.\n\nThis distinction doesn't make the data useless, but it should make you a more informed consumer. It'd be nice if companies could stop using the word \"stress\" for what they're actually measuring—perhaps \"physiological arousal\" or \"autonomic nervous system activity,\" which would be more accurate, but less marketable, so I'm not holding my breath. (Although, if I did, I'm sure my stress score would skyrocket.)\n\nA device marketed to help you manage stress may actually create more of it by generating anxiety-inducing alerts about normal physiological variation that it misinterprets as distress. The sooner we're honest about that gap, the sooner these devices can actually help us, rather than selling us a quantified illusion of self-knowledge they don't really have.",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on DJ and producer Shadow Child - and AI - with his predictions for all 32 FA Cup third-round ties.",
    "fullText": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has made his predictions for all 32 FA Cup third-round ties.\n\nHe is up against DJ and producer Shadow Child, aka Simon Neale, and AI.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\n\nShadow Child is a Portsmouth fan who has fond memories of the FA Cup that go back much further than when Pompey won it in 2008.\n\n\"That was huge, and so was when we lost narrowly in the final two years later,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But my favourite FA Cup memory was actually 1992, when we had a run to the semi-finals and lost to eventual winners Liverpool in a replay.\n\n\"I was 15, stood on the Clock End at Highbury for the first of those games, and that is when I fully understood the emotion that goes with football.\n\n\"I'd been going to Fratton Park since I was five, but that was the moment for me. That's the power of the FA Cup, and a run like that can resonate with you for your whole life.\n\n\"The year we won it, all five games from round three to the final were 1-0 wins. You take them all, obviously, but most of those ties were not that glamorous.\n\n\"The really memorable game that year was our 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Rio Ferdinand ended up in goal when we scored our winner from the penalty spot, which sounds crazy talking about it now. Again, I will never forget it.\"\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\n5th in League Two v 23rd in Championship\n\nOxford must be short of confidence going into this one. They are in a relegation battle, have lost four of their past five games and are still without a manager after sacking Gary Rowett before Christmas.\n\nCraig Short is in interim charge and, like all teams fighting the drop, I'm sure Championship survival is his priority over the FA Cup.\n\nMK Dons boss Paul Warne is an old team-mate of mine from my village team, Horsford Under-12s, and he learnt a lot from playing alongside me.\n\nThey are going well under him in the league and I have got faith in Paul to deliver an FA Cup shock.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, MK Dons to win on penalties\n\nSimon's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\n24th in League One v 13th in League Two\n\nPort Vale are struggling and they are another team who have just changed their manager. This will be Jon Brady's first game in charge, after they sacked Darren Moore at the end of December.\n\nVale got a big win over Blackpool on New Year's Day but they have still got the worst home record in League One, with only two wins there all season.\n\nFleetwood knocked out another League One side, Luton, on penalties in round two which was a great result - so the Cod Army won't be afraid of Vale, either.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Port Vale win on penalties\n\n4th in Championship v 15th in League One\n\nPaul Heckingbottom is doing a fine job at Preston but, with them chasing promotion, he is probably weighing up whether he wants another FA Cup run after his side reached the quarter-finals last year.\n\nWigan have come through two penalty shootouts to reach round three. Their boss Ryan Lowe will be desperate to get one over his former club but, even if Preston make changes, I still think they will edge this.\n\n9th in Championship v 17th in Premier League\n\nMoney-bags Wrexham have picked up a bit of form in the Championship, with one of my colleagues from the Monday Night Club, Conor Coady, their rock at the back.\n\nNottingham Forest got a huge win at West Ham on Tuesday and Sean Dyche will want to carry that momentum on here.\n\nI suspect this will be tight, because Wrexham are unbeaten in 10 games at home, but Forest should have a little bit too much quality.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\n\nEV Charger Points Stadium, 12:15 GMT\n\n18th in League Two v 12th in Championship\n\nI know Cheltenham aren't having a great time of it because one of their fans is a regular caller on 606.\n\nLeicester are having a poor season too, though, and their supporters were expecting a lot more from them following their relegation from the Premier League.\n\nThis is a must-win game for Foxes boss Marti Cifuentes, who is coming under a bit of pressure because his side are toiling in mid-table.\n\nCheltenham will be really up for this, but I think Cifuentes will get the result he needs.\n\n12th in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI'd like to think these teams will have a real go at the FA Cup this season, because neither of them have got relegation to worry about, but they both come into this tie off the back of poor results.\n\nThe Black Cats' defeat at Brentford was a very un-Sunderland like performance compared to what we've seen from them this season, while Everton will be very disappointed to have only drawn at home to Wolves.\n\nThe last time Sunderland reached the final, when they lost to Liverpool in 1992, they broke my heart on the way when they beat my Norwich side in the semi-final. I missed a great chance in that game too, when I ballooned a shot over the bar.\n\nIt still haunts me how we didn't make it to Wembley that year - we deserved to. Sunderland are due another FA Cup run because they have only made it to round four once in the past 10 years, but I don't think this is their year either.\n\nI can see this going to penalties, and Jordan Pickford will win it for the Toffees.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Everton win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I don't see this being a great game, more a battle of attrition. 1-0 after extra time\n\nAI's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\n14th in National League North v 13th in Premier League\n\nWhat a tie this is. My 606 co-host Robbie Savage built the foundations for this Macclesfield side and they have gone on an amazing run under John Rooney to get this far.\n\nIt started with a win over Atherton Laburnum Rovers in the second qualifying round in September.\n\nOne of their scorers that day was Ethan McLeod, who died in a car accident before Christmas on his way back from a game, which puts everything in perspective.\n\nThis would be the biggest shock in FA Cup history if Macclesfield won, because no sixth-tier side has ever beaten one from the top flight since the FA Cup started in 1871, but I don't think that will happen.\n\nPalace have not been in good form recently but they played well in their draw with Aston Villa on Wednesday when they defended strongly.\n\nThe holders are solid even when they don't fire up front, and they should win this pretty comfortably.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I'd love this to be different because we all love a giant-killing, but I can't see it. 0-4\n\n20th in Premier League v 22nd in League Two\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards is starting to get a tune out of his players and Mateus Mane is really shining for them.\n\nDoes Edwards change things up here, or does he look to build more momentum?\n\nThis is a local derby but he has played for both clubs so he will get what the tie is all about, and Shrewsbury don't really look like they are in the kind of shape to spring a surprise at Molineux, either.\n\nThey have not won any of their past eight league games and staying in the Football League will be the main thing on their manager Michael Appleton's mind.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\n2nd in National League v 21st in League One\n\nBoreham Wood are flying and Robbie Savage always tells me how strong they are - he really rates them.\n\nThey reached the fifth round in 2022 under Luke Garrard, when they lost at Everton, and I think their run will continue this year too.\n\nI know Garrard's focus might be on promotion to the Football League, because getting out of the National League is brutal, but his side are up against a Burton team who are bang out of form at the bottom of League One.\n\nWood will have to stop the top scorer in the FA Cup this season, Tyrese Shade, who has scored five goals in two games for Burton so far - but I am backing them to put Shade in the shade.\n\n19th in Premier League v 5th in Championship\n\nI have a feeling this will be quite close. Millwall are really well organised under Alex Neil and I am not surprised they are doing well this season.\n\nBurnley have started picking up a few draws, but they still haven't won since the end of October.\n\nThis could be the day that changes, although Scott Parker's side will have to work hard to finish Millwall off.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Burnley win on penalties\n\n23rd in League One v 15th in Championship\n\nSouthampton have dropped off after making a good start under Tonda Eckert. He won his first four games after replacing Will Still at the start of November, but has not won any of his past six matches.\n\nDoncaster are on a similar run in League One, taking one point from a possible 18, and with both teams in such poor form, it might take penalties to separate them.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Southampton to win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: Putting our south-coast differences aside, Southampton will probably win... but come on Doncaster! 2-0\n\n9th in Premier League v 2nd in Championship\n\nIt will be interesting to see what Fulham boss Marco Silva does here, with his team on such a good run of Premier League results. I hope he goes strong, to try to keep their momentum going.\n\nSilva has good record in the FA Cup anyhow, reaching the quarter-final twice in the past three years. He has also never lost a third-round tie with any of the four English clubs he has managed, and I don't see that changing this weekend.\n\nMiddlesbrough got back on track with a big win over Southampton on Sunday but they hit a sticky patch over Christmas when their goals dried up and it is pretty obvious that their promotion bid will be the priority for their manager Kim Hellberg.\n\n3rd in Championship v 18th in League One\n\nIpswich have started to hit their stride in the Championship and have only lost one of their past eight games.\n\nLike Hellberg at Boro, I suspect Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna will make full use of his squad here but they should still have too much for a Blackpool side who are struggling in League One.\n\nIt is nice to be able to predict an Ipswich result again, and it would be good if their fans had something to cheer about after they had such a miserable time in the Premier League last season.\n\nMcKenna is such a good manager, I think they will get one of the automatic promotion spots, sadly. They won't win the FA Cup though!\n\n2nd in Premier League v 14th in League One\n\nManchester City have reached the final in the past two seasons and they are my pick to win the FA Cup this year. Pep Guardiola always takes the competition seriously and that won't change whatever happens in the title race.\n\nGuardiola's side have paid the price for not putting games to bed in the past few days and those dropped points are making things easier for Arsenal at the top of the table.\n\nI don't see Manchester City having any problems here, though, even if they field a second-string side.\n\nExeter City boss Gary Caldwell lifted the FA Cup in 2013 when he was part of the Wigan team that upset Manchester City in the final. What a great memory that must be for him, but his side are going out on Saturday.\n\n6th in Premier League v 15th in Premier League\n\nI just wonder how much Wednesday night's epic game against Leeds will have taken out of Newcastle, who have got the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final with Manchester City coming up next week too.\n\nThere was also plenty of late drama in Bournemouth's win over Tottenham, but my concern with the Cherries is more about the effect of Antoine Semenyo's departure, because it appears he has played his last game for them.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe does not have a great record against his old club in the Premier League, where he has not got the better of them in seven attempts, but he did beat them in the Carabao Cup in 2022.\n\nI was tempted to go for a Bournemouth win here, but I am not sure how many changes Andoni Iraola will make either.\n\nThe one thing I am sure of is that there will be a few goals flying in, because of the way both teams play. Let's go for another thriller, with a shootout to settle it.\n\nSutton's prediction: 3-3 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties\n\n4th in League Two v 2nd in League Two\n\nThese teams meet each other again in the league next week, and I suspect the points will matter more to Swindon boss Ian Holloway and Salford manager Karl Robinson than this tie.\n\nSalford beat Swindon 3-2 here in September but Holloway's side have the best away record in the division and I'm going with them to nick it in extra time.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-0 after extra time\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Salford win on penalties\n\n24th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nIt is really sad to see what has happened at Sheffield Wednesday and there is no way for them to salvage their season now.\n\nBrentford are flying at the moment under Keith Andrews and they are another club who I'd love to see have a real go at the FA Cup this season.\n\nThe Bees have never got past the quarter-finals in their history, and have not even got that far since 1989. You only have to look at Palace last year to find a team winning it for the first time so it is definitely doable for them too.\n\n8th in Championship v 1st in Championship\n\nCoventry are having a little wobble. They are still top of the Championship, but Sunday's defeat at Birmingham means they have only one win in their past five matches.\n\nThat just makes me think Sky Blues boss Frank Lampard will rest players here, and it is a real opportunity for my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins against his former club.\n\nRobins had that great run to the semi-finals with Coventry a couple of years back, and you can imagine he will be absolutely determined that Stoke get through this tie.\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Stoke win on penalties\n\n10th in Championship v 6th in Championship\n\nWatford have really hit form and come into this on the back of four wins in a row.\n\nBristol City, in contrast, have been patchy but again I think both sides will make changes.\n\nIt finished 1-1 at Ashton Gate in November, and I'm going for the same scoreline again, with City winning on penalties.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Bristol City to win on penalties\n\n6th in League Two v 14th in Championship\n\nCambridge are on a heck of a run, and have gone 14 games unbeaten in all competitions since the end of October.\n\nBirmingham, meanwhile, have been a bit flaky. Blues boss Chris Davies needed Sunday's win over Coventry because his side have not really got going this season.\n\nOn paper, this has the makings of a shock because Birmingham have not won many on the road, but I actually fancy my old club to go on a bit of a cup run this year, and they will start by giving Cambridge an education.\n\n12th in League Two v 2nd in National League South\n\nI was at Blundell Park when Grimsby knocked Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup in August, and what a night that was.\n\nNow the Mariners are trying to avoid being on the wrong end of a huge upset themselves but, again, home advantage will help.\n\nWeston-super-Mare are in the third round for the first time in their 138-year history, which is an amazing achievement, but their cup run ends here.\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 17:45\n\n14th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\n\nPoor old Thomas Frank. He looked so happy at Brentford but Spurs have a habit of turning happy managers into total miseries.\n\nHe really needs a win here, and a good run in the cup too, but when you compare the two teams, and the way they are playing, then there's only one winner here - and that's Villa.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: This is the kind of game Tottenham need, because there is less pressure on them. Villa are going more for the top four and Spurs could take this. 3-2\n\n19th in Championship v 8th in Premier League\n\nIt doesn't feel as if Liam Rosenior's appointment has been particularly welcomed by some Chelsea fans.\n\nThis is his first game in charge and he could really do with making a fast start to help win some of the doubters over.\n\nThere are tougher tests to come - like Arsenal in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final next week - but I think he will get the result he wants here.\n\nThere will be a packed house at The Valley, with Charlton's biggest crowd for an FA Cup tie in 50 years, but the Addicks are not in great form and Chelsea's quality should see them through.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: It's been a turbulent week for Chelsea too, and again we will see a response. I always try to visualise things when I think about them, and when I pictured The Valley, I just saw Chelsea scoring! 1-3\n\n13th in Championship v 16th in Premier League\n\nLeeds have been terrific recently and, as regular readers will know, I am really pleased for their manager Daniel Farke and how he has changed the narrative about his future.\n\nI can see Farke making plenty of changes here because, while he would love a cup run, he knows there is still work to do to keep his side in the Premier League.\n\nThat's why I am going for Derby to cause an upset. They are improving all the time under John Eustace and while Leeds will be full of confidence off the back of the past few weeks, I am not sure they will maintain their intensity with a second-string side.\n\n21st in Championship v 1st in Premier League\n\nArsenal will definitely make changes here, but it won't make any difference.\n\nPortsmouth are in trouble at the bottom of the Championship and they look short of what is required there, let alone against the Premier League leaders - or even their reserves.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I very reluctantly have to be realistic here - I hate to say it, but I would be really shocked if Arsenal didn't win. If we took them to penalties that would be incredible, but I don't think we will. It depends what team they put out, but whoever plays, it is going to be difficult for us.\n\nI can't make it to the game but I will be glued to the TV, and my dad will be there - he has been a season ticket holder at Fratton Park since 1967. 0-1\n\n7th in Championship v 20th in Championship\n\nHull are having a great season, while Blackburn are in serious danger of being relegated.\n\nIt is no surprise that Rovers are struggling because they just don't have the quality in their side.\n\nIt turns my stomach to see the state of my old club now compared to the way it was when I was there in the 1990s, because it is a shadow of its former self.\n\nSurvival is all Blackburn fans can hope for, while Hull supporters must be dreaming of a return to the Premier League. They are going to win this tie, too.\n\n22nd in Championship v 3rd in League Two\n\nNorwich are another of my old clubs who are fighting relegation, although at least Philippe Clement has picked up a few wins since he took charge in November.\n\nThe Canaries have lost their past couple of home games, to Watford and Stoke, but Clement has done really well to give them a chance of staying up. Now they need to spend in January, because he needs a bit of help.\n\nI am not sure Clement wants or needs an FA Cup run now but Norwich fans could do with a bit of cheer at Carrow Road.\n\nI am backing Norwich to win but I need to apologise to Walsall boss Mat Sadler anyhow. They were flying last season, but then he came on the Monday Night Club in January and he was one of the managers we cursed.\n\nWhoever came on, their results fell through the floor afterwards, so we were to blame for Walsall's slide down the table.\n\n16th in Championship v 11th in League One\n\nTwo wily old managers go head to head here.\n\nBetween them, Sheffield United's Chris Wilder and Mansfield's Nigel Clough have spent more than 50 years in the dug-out, and I have got a lot of respect for both of them.\n\nWilder has turned things around for the Blades after their dreadful start to the campaign and, while Clough has won his last three games with the Stags, I am going for Sheffield United to continue their improvement.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\n17th in Championship v 18th in Championship\n\nWest Brom have just sacked their manager Ryan Mason, so James Morrison is in charge for this one.\n\nThe Baggies could really do with a win but their form on the road is awful - they have lost 10 away games in a row.\n\nSwansea changed their manager recently too, with Vitor Matos replacing Alan Sheehan in November, and their season has been just as disappointing.\n\nWhile West Brom won 3-2 when these teams met at The Hawthorns in November, Swansea pinched a 1-0 win at Liberty Stadium on New Year's Day.\n\nI'm going for another close game this time.\n\nSutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Swansea to win on penalties\n\n18th in Premier League v 11th in Championship\n\nThis is a must-win for West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo and, let's face it, they might sack him anyway even if he gets past QPR.\n\nI don't think home advantage helps the Hammers, who suffered a catastrophic defeat against Forest at the London Stadium on Tuesday. I'm not sure how many of their fans will turn up for this game, and the ones who do are not going to be in a good mood either.\n\nBut while West Ham have been very poor recently, they still have some good players and they should surely still see off a mid-table Championship team on their own patch.\n\nQPR have been knocked out in the third round of the FA Cup more times - 52 - than any other side since the current format of the competition started 100 years ago.\n\nI am going for them to suffer defeat number 53, and for Nuno to survive a little bit longer.\n\n7th in Premier League v 11th in Premier League\n\nBrighton have been quite erratic this season, and I have done really badly at predicting their results, but they have proved time and time again how dangerous they are.\n\nIt's a boost for United that Bruno Fernandes is fit again, but their draw with Burnley on Thursday was still a poor result.\n\nI know United fans love it when their side proves me wrong after I predict they will lose, but I can't see them doing that on Sunday.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: United have had an interesting week. I've gone for them to win because I am expecting a huge reaction from them and their fans at Old Trafford, but Danny Welbeck will nick one for Brighton. 3-1\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, United win on penalties\n\n4th in Premier League v 17th in League One\n\nBristol City fans will come to Anfield hoping for a repeat of their famous win here in the FA Cup in 2008, but I don't see another shock on the cards.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot will have learnt his lesson about the cup after last season, when his side crashed out to Plymouth after he made 10 changes.\n\nSlot needs an FA Cup run this season, so I am sure he will not risk another upset here. If Liverpool were to lose this, he would be under serious pressure.\n\nI am just not convinced by the way his side are playing at the moment, and I don't think many Liverpool fans are either.\n\nEven so, they are at home to a League One side, and this should be a pretty routine victory.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

I am forever thankful, I love you.\"\n\nWhen McDonald urgently needed a kidney for a vital transplant, his older brother Fraser offered his.\n\nThe former Scotland international, who served Burnley and Fulham in the Premier League, believes he would not have been able to resume his playing career but for his sibling.\n\nIn fact, he says the outcome could have been much worse had Fraser not stepped forward.\n\n\"You can class the transplant as life-saving because it is,\" McDonald, 37, tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"I will forever be grateful to Fraser. I'd have done the same for him, but the main thing is we're both here and we're as healthy as possible.\"\n\nOn Saturday, McDonald is hoping to feature in League One Exeter's FA Cup third-round tie at Manchester City.\n\nFraser will be among 7,800 Exeter fans at Etihad Stadium cheering on his brother as the Devon club look to surprise the seven-time winners.\n\n\"I'm massively proud of my brother,\" Fraser, 40, says.\n\n\"He has done incredible really, even more so after the kidney operation.\n\n\"It takes a lot more determination to come back from something like that and play professionally again.\"",

    "description": "As Manchester United look for Ruben Amorim's successor, Phil McNulty asks if a club's so-called \"DNA\" is actually relevant?",
    "fullText": "Manchester United's latest search for a new manager after Ruben Amorim's sacking has revived the time-honoured call for his successor to fit the club's \"DNA\".\n\nThis mysterious commodity is the comfort blanket in times of turmoil - usually harking back to glory days and happier times.\n\nAfter Amorim's departure, former United defender Gary Neville believes the Red Devils are at the point they need a manager \"who fits the DNA of the football club\".\n\nIt is not solely a United issue, though, with former Liverpool striker John Aldridge reacting to the 0-0 draw against Leeds United by posting on X: \"It seems we've lost our DNA. No real drive, desire and lack of ideas.\"\n\nWhen trouble strikes, the \"DNA\" call demands a return to what a club knows best, what it stands for, what brought its biggest successes.\n\nThat may explain why United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his cohorts are looking at figures with rich Old Trafford history as they seek an interim manager.\n\nDarren Fletcher took charge at Burnley on Wednesday, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - sacked from the post in 2021 - and Michael Carrick are also in the frame.\n\nFletcher and Carrick won 10 Premier League titles between them. Solskjaer won six, and also scored one of the most famous goals in United's history to win the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich in Barcelona.\n\nFletcher even felt the need to seek Sir Alex Ferguson's \"blessing\" to take temporary charge, such is the 84-year-old's lingering influence.\n\nFerguson, as a reminder, won 13 Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, and two domestic league and FA Cup Doubles.\n\nBut does his \"blessing\" still need to be sought 13 years after his retirement? Will doing so really revive United's pursuit of that lost \"DNA\"?\n\nFormer United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"The thing about Manchester United is that it's not just any club. They have been through [Jose] Mourinho, [Louis] Van Gaal... big-name managers and it's not worked.\n\n\"They come in, they know it is a short period of time, and they bring in their own systems, which don't work unless you play the Manchester United way.\n\n\"The club should think very, very long and hard about who fits the bill. We've heard names like [Thomas] Tuchel, [Julian] Nagelsmann, Xavi, [Zinedine] Zidane - all big names, but do they understand Manchester United?\"\n\nSo does a club \"DNA\" actually exist, or is the notion irrelevant? Does it matter that a manager must \"get\" a club through past association?",

Twenty-seven Australia wins in 35 Ashes Tests in this country since the turn of the century tells a conclusive story.\n\nNo, the feelings of bewilderment, dismay and downright anger come from yet another Ashes tour with concerns over England cricketers and whether there is a problematic drinking culture.\n\nEight years ago, Jonny Bairstow was lampooned in the Australian media for a 'headbutt' to home opener Cameron Bancroft in a Perth bar. On the same trip Ben Duckett, then with the England Lions, was punished for pouring a drink over James Anderson.\n\nAt the end of the Covid Ashes of 2021-22, an early-hours drinking session had to be broken up by police in Hobart.\n\nNow, after a 4-1 defeat and England's most disappointing Australia tour for decades, has come the revelation that Harry Brook got into a fight with a nightclub bouncer on the tour of New Zealand that preceded the Ashes.\n\nIt was the night before a one-day international in Wellington for which Brook was England captain and which the tourists lost.\n\nThis was supposed to be England's big opportunity to finally compete in Australia after a miserable run of one away series win in 40 years.\n\nBut it has been a shambles of a tour. Preparation that many regard as not fit for purpose. Then awful shots, dropped catches and scattergun bowling when the series began. Meanwhile, off the field, there has been concern over England players drinking in bars.\n\nIn what was supposed to be the crowning glory of the 'Bazball' project, England's moniker could be perhaps cruelly be renamed 'Boozeball' after the latest revelations.\n\nJust as the players were relaxing on the outfield of the Sydney Cricket Ground in the aftermath of yet another defeat in the fifth Test, the Brook report dropped in the Daily Telegraph,, external followed by statements from England and the man himself.\n\nAn hour earlier, the England and Wales Cricket Board had released a statement from chief executive Richard Gould. Gould said he would review the tour of Australia, including the behaviour of the players.\n\nThere was no mention of New Zealand, even although he already knew what happened, as the details had not been made public. His organisation had not felt it necessary to utter a word about the incident until the Telegraph newspaper did it for them two months after the event.",

    "description": "Zach Wilson's contract draws to a close in March, lending uncertainty to his future with Miami.",
    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS ― When the Miami Dolphins made the call to see what they had in Quinn Ewers as the season fell into foregone conclusions, starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was not the only one left watching.\n\nZach Wilson, whom Miami brought in last off-season on a one-year, $6 million deal, was sitting right there with him.\n\n\"Obviously, I came here with Tua as the primary starter,\" Wilson said. \"My goal here was, if I got a chance to get on the field ― obviously you never wish for anyone to get injured, but if by means that happened ― to have an opportunity to go out there and play. That was kind of what I expected. Obviously, I wish I could have played, but I understand how the season goes sometimes.\"\n\nMore: Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa says he'd welcome fresh start elsewhere\n\nA second-round draft pick by the New York Jets out of BYU in 2021, Wilson appeared in 34 games before serving as the Denver Broncos' backup quarterback in 2024.\n\nAfter signing with Miami, Wilson served as the Dolphins' backup quarterback for six games. He was then ruled inactive and labeled the team's emergency quarterback following the team's promotion of Ewers for their Week 7 game against Cleveland.\n\nWilson appeared in four games for Miami, completing 6 of 11 pass attempts for 32 yards. Most of that production came in the Dolphins' 33-8 Week 1 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nDespite the team's decision to evaluate Ewers in lieu of giving Wilson snaps as the season drew to an end, Wilson does not hold ill will toward the Dolphins.\n\n“They do a great job here,\" Wilson said. \"I think the organization is awesome. I really appreciate the owner as well, I think he does a good job taking care of all the guys. I think Mike (McDaniel) does a great job, especially from the offensive standpoint. I thought we did a lot of really cool stuff. I really enjoyed Coach Bev (Darrell Bevell) in the QB room as well.\"\n\n\"I loved my time here,\" he added.\n\nPer Spotrac.com, the Dolphins added 2026 as a void year in Wilson's contract to split up the cap-hit. His contract is set to end in March, at which point Wilson will become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nAs a result of this arrangement, Wilson's contract carries a $3.8 million cap hit for the 2026 season.\n\nWhether or not the Dolphins will opt to resign him is undetermined, but Wilson is open to considering his options when it comes to where he'll eventually end up. He noted that the hiring of the Dolphins' new general manager likely will have an impact on how it \"all plays out.\"\n\n“Of course, I would love to start somewhere,\" he said. \"Obviously, I don’t know what that looks like. I don’t know if I’ll have that opportunity or not yet, but I’m willing to compete wherever I end up and try to just put myself in the best position possible.”\n\nAlex Peterman is a high school sports reporter for The Palm Beach Post.

    "description": "A head-to-head comparison between the Patriots and Chargers ahead of their Sunday meeting.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots played a comparatively easy schedule in the regular season, there is no denying that. That being said, they are still a battle-tested team that cut its teeth against a handful of high-quality opponents or at least units. The playoffs, however, are a different animal: every team is good, and the Los Angeles Chargers are no exception.\n\nWhile not statistically outstanding on offense, they are still capable of moving the ball and scoring points. Their defense, meanwhile, has been one of the best in the NFL against both the pass and the run. They finished with an inferior record to the Patriots, but still looked like one of the better teams in the AFC at times.\n\nHow do the Chargers stack up against the Patriots, though? Let’s take a look at our head-to-head comparison.\n\nPatriots pass offense vs. Chargers pass defense: Led by Pro Bowlers Derwin James and Tuli Tuipulotu, the Chargers pass defense has been a top unit in the NFL this season. Fusing a relentless pass rush not relying on. the blitz with a zone-heavy coverage in the backend, the unit is ranked third in interceptions (19), seventh in EPA per dropback (-0.051) and ninth in net yards per attempt (5.6). That said, it will be going up against an MVP-caliber quarterback and a passing offense that has been no less impressive. The matchup will be of the highest quality, and arguably the toughest so far for both units. We are giving New England a minor edge, though, because Drake Maye has been one of the best QBs in football against zone this year, completing 74.9% of his passes and averaging 9.2 yards per pass, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. | Edge: Patriots\n\nPatriots pass defense vs. Chargers pass offense: Justin Herbert is one of the top quarterbacks in football, and a player capable of making life hard for any pass defense in the NFL. So, why are we seeing this as an advantageous matchup for New England? Mainly because of Los Angeles’ offensive line. The unit has struggled mightily to find stability and quality play this season, which has impacted Herbert’s effectiveness and limited the offense as a whole. Granted, New England’s pass rush has been anything but inspiring, pressuring opposing passers on just 20.3% of dropbacks, but the team has an ace in the hole: the disruptive interior line duo of Christian Barmore and Milton Williams could become a major problem for Los Angeles. If they play to their capabilities against a suspect O-line, Herbert and company might be in for a long day. | Edge: Patriots\n\nPatriots rushing offense vs. Chargers run defense: Since turning the calendar to December, no rushing attack in the NFL has been as productive as the Patriots’: led by Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson, the group is producing 0.179 expected points per run play and averaging over 180 yards per game. However, this matchup is a case of the unstoppable force meeting the immovable object. The Chargers defense, after all, is ranked fourth in the NFL in EPA per run over that same span (-0.192). Like the previous two matchups outlined above, this one projects as a highly-competitive battle that could easily go either way. We are confident in the Patriots at full strength, but two starting offensive linemen missing practice on Wednesday with an illness is certainly not ideal and slightly tips the scales in Los Angeles’ favor for now. | Edge: Chargers\n\nPatriots run defense vs. Chargers rushing offense: New England’s run defense should benefit from Milton Williams shaking off the rust and Robert Spillane returning after a four-week absence. Question marks still remain when it comes to the unit’s ability to slow down the opposition, particularly if Khyiris Tonga is unable to go and Spillane not at a 100% yet. Of course, the Patriots are not the only ones dealing with injury woes; Chargers starting RB Omarion Hampton was missing from practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. Even if he is cleared by Sunday night, the offensive line still hangs over his and his team’s collective head as a factor of uncertainty. Case in point: L.A. is ranked 26th in run game EPA (-0.145) since the start of December. | Edge: Patriots\n\nThe only special teams Pro Bowler on either side of this matchup is Los Angeles kicker Cameron Dicker, who made 92.7% of his field goals and 97.1% of his extra points during the regular season — numbers that are clearly better than his counterpart Andy Borregales’ 84.4% and 96.4%, respectively. However, place kicking is only one piece of the puzzle in the game’s third phase. New England, after all, holds an edge virtually everywhere else, with one matchup particularly intriguing from a Patriots perspective: Marcus Jones, who is averaging 17.2 yards per punt return (2nd) and has two touchdowns to his name this season (t-1st), versus a coverage unit surrendering 14.5 yards per runback (30th). | Edge: Patriots\n\nJim Harbaugh and his coordinators, OC Greg Roman, DC Jesse Minter and STC Ryan Ficken, headline a coaching staff that brings plenty of experience to the table — something that cannot fully be said about the Patriots. While Mike Vrabel and Josh McDaniels have seen plenty of football through their careers, defensive play caller Zak Kuhr in particular is a relative wild card. To his credit, he has done a fine job especially considering the circumstances of coordinator Terrell William’ cancer diagnosis, but he will have to be on his A-game against the Chargers. | Edge: Chargers\n\nAs can be seen by all six of our categories, the Patriots’ first playoff game in four years projects to be a highly-contested affair. Both teams are dealing with some personnel questions, both teams have played winning football so far this year, both teams have talented players in all three phases capable of individually making a difference. Ultimately, we believe New England should be in a position to win, especially in front of what will be an electric home crowd at Gillette Stadium, but the challenge is a tougher one than what the team has gotten used to in the regular season.",

    "description": "Liberty Media is offering €200,000 to any team that signs a non-Spanish and/or Italian rider and wins Moto3, among a large list of other financial incentives.",
    "fullText": "The MotoGP grid is dominated by Spanish and Italian riders; that's just a fact. Out of the 22-rider lineup, 15 are from either Spain or Italy, making up 68% of the grid. But Liberty Media, MotoGP's new owner, wants to change this, and I couldn't disagree more with the means the company is going about it—passports over meritocracy.\n\nLiberty has introduced new financial incentives that'll be available from 2026 to 2028 to teams and riders that meet certain criteria, with the intention of diversifying the nationalities that we see on the grid from Moto3 onwards.\n\nThe financial incentive works like this: Any teams that hire and win with riders from countries that have an officially reported population of more than 100,000 people and have less than 10% representation in the MotoGP paddock—between Moto3, Moto2, and MotoGP—get up to €200,000 ($233,912). That's a very long-winded way of saying 'any nationality that's not Spanish or Italian' because they're the only two nationalities that it excludes.\n\nIf I were naive, I'd say this is a thoughtless way to diversify the competition, punishing riders who deserve to be on the grid and ultimately diluting the level of the classes. If I were more cynical, I'd say this is a 'throw money at it' plan to get more US riders onto the grid ahead of a 'Ride to Survive'-style docuseries, so Liberty can turn MotoGP into the money-making machine that F1 now is. And I'm all for blowing MotoGP up to the highest level—I want everyone to get the joy I get from watching this incredible sport.\n\nBut I don't want to achieve that by diluting the talent coming through.\n\nThe main reason we have so many talented riders from Spain and Italy is that there's so much happening at a grassroots racing level, which we don't have in almost any other country. Italy had a national racing championship before WW1, but MotoGP, then the FIM Road Racing World Championship, didn't start until 1949. Spain, too, had a racing scene before the FIM Road Racing World Championship, making these two countries two of the very few to have recognized national motorcycle racing before the FIM Road Racing World Championship—Kel surprise that feeder system is still, well, feeding.\n\nAccessible grassroots racing puts the Italians and Spanish at an advantage, so if Liberty wants to level that out, then it needs to invest more money in talent cups outside of Europe or in grassroots racing outside of Europe, so when the final product (rider) is ready for Moto3, it's a fairer game when it comes to passport versus merit. It's not just wrong to give a less skilled rider a seat because of a financial incentive; it dilutes the grid.\n\nI'm not saying Liberty shouldn't financially incentivise other nationalities so that we can have a more diverse, and hopefully a more popular grid, bringing eyeballs and sponsors from around the world. But this seems like a ham-fisted, superficial approach to solving a much deeper problem, which would take considerably more money, time, and effort to resolve.\n\nNot everyone, even at RideApart, agrees with my take, however.\n\nRideApart's Editor-in-Chief, Jonathon Klein, had this to say, \"Honestly, Liberty's move to incorporate other riders from around the world is a welcome one. Too much emphasis has been placed on Spain and Italy in recent decades. Though they've produced generational talent, they're also benefiting from support from the series and the culture the series has promoted, whereas other locales have not. And for those Spanish and Italian supporters who've denounced the move, you're telling me the riders who compete at the Isle of Man TT, at World Superbike, or the States' superbike series aren't talented enough to compete? Bullshit. More support needs to be doled out across the world, instead of the concentration of resources on two countries. I welcome the change.\"\n\nStay informed with our newsletter every weekday   back \n\nIt's important to note that Dorna supports about 10 Talent Cups or racing series from around the world, but doesn't specifically fund any that directly support Italian and Spanish riders; however, both nations dominate the grids in the European Talent Cups and the FIM MiniGP World Series. So pull funding here if the Spanish and Italian's already have a leg up due to their motorcycle racing culture, and invest it in other talent cups from around the world, along with the money for the new \"financial incentive\", which is considerable.\n\nThe financial incentive for teams that use a rider that meets the new requirements are as follows:\n\nAny team with a rider who wins the Moto3 junior world Championship and wins at least four races gets €200,000.\n\nAny team with a rider who finishes second in the Moto3 Junior World Championship and wins at least three races gets €100,000.\n\nAny team with a rider who finishes third in the Moto3 Junior World Championship and wins at least two races gets €50,000.\n\nAny team with a rider who wins the Moto2 European Championship and gets at least four race wins gets €100,000.\n\nThe only redeeming quality to this financial incentive is that the rider has to do very well in the championship and win a set number of races, or it would seem redeeming. The reality is that Moto3 teams are poorly funded, often operating on a shoestring budget, so they're even more incentivised to avail of this financial incentive. The problem is, if a team chooses a weaker rider in the hope of the rider doing well enough to get that Liberty Media cash, and then the rider isn't competitive, the team loses, the rider loses, and most importantly, the rider who should've gotten the seat had there been no financial incentive loses.\n\nWhat do we know, though, about the struggles of riders from other countries trying to make it to the top level? Not a whole lot compared to Jack Miller, who moved to Europe at just 16 to continue his racing journey and compete in the Spanish and German 125cc series, before moving to Moto3. In a previous interview, not specifically about this new financial incentive, Miller said, \"I don’t want it to be on my passport, I want it to be on my speed. Obviously, Spain and Italy have extremely strong riders at this point in time, but I don’t want to be here just because of my passport; that doesn’t give me any interest at all.”\n\nSuzuka Is Selling Its Old Asphalt And Yes, I Kinda Want Some\n\nEx-Olympian Turned Cartel King Has Massive Private Collection of MotoGP Bikes Seized",

    "description": "We grade the Trae Young trade for the Hawks and the Wizards.",
    "fullText": "Trae Young-CJ McCollum trade grades: Hawks get fresh start, Wizards take low-risk flier on All-Star guard originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter eight seasons, four All-Star appearances, and one Eastern Conference Finals run, the Trae Young era in Atlanta is officially over. The Hawks came to terms on a deal with the Wizards on Wednesday night to ship Young out for a package based around CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert, as first reported by ESPN's Shams Charania. Early reporting by Jake Fischer indicates that no draft picks are involved in the trade.\n\nThe Hawks' Eastern Conference Finals run back in 2021 was supposed to be the start of a successful era for Young. Instead, the Hawks hovered around mediocrity, going 221-272 in games that he played and failing to get out of the first round during his two subsequent playoff runs. The Play-In Tournament quickly became the Trae-In, where his Hawks have landed in each of the past four seasons.\n\nNot all of that mediocrity is on Young, of course. But the Hawks were ready to turn the page. This is triple-double machine Jalen Johnson's team now, and Trae will get a fresh start on a rebuilding Wizards team in need of a point guard.\n\nBut did the Hawks get enough for their distressed star? Here's how both teams fared in the biggest deal of the NBA season thus far.\n\nThis may seem like a paltry return for Young. Sure, he has substantial defensive limitations, but he's spearheaded some great offenses due to his brilliant passing. He led the league last year with 11.6 assists per game. He's never quite gotten the proper recognition for how great he is as a pick-and-roll facilitator.\n\nYoung's flaws did drive down his market, but the lack of interest throughout the league was also about both the depth at point guard and his contract situation. He's earning $46 million this year, with a player option for $49 million next season. And most teams already have their own franchise lead ballhandler to build around. There simply wasn't an appetite from most teams to take on that money.\n\nThe Hawks are glad to be off that deal. Young likely would have taken his $49 million player option for next season if he had not gotten an extension. With that off their books, they gain optionality to use cap space to add a mid-tier player next summer that fits better around Johnson.\n\nYoung's market was also driven down by his shooting decline. When he was one of the top scorers in the league, his defensive warts were easier to justify. He hasn't been the same from 3 in recent years, hitting just 30.5 percent of his attempts this season and 34 percent last season. His free throw attempts also took a dip as the rules were modified to remove some of his favorite foul-drawing maneuvers over the past few years.\n\nOnto CJ McCollum, who is an expiring salary and still a useful player. His 3-point shooting, shot creation, and passing is badly needed from a Hawks team that is ranked 20th in halfcourt offense. McCollum isn't the guy he was 10 years ago, but he still has some gas left in the tank as a microwave scorer.\n\nKispert is another player who should help the Hawks score. He's a solid career 38 percent shooter from 3 and an underrated cutter who finishes well at the basket. Like McCollum, he doesn't defend his position well though. At age 26, that probably isn't changing. He's slightly overpaid on his deal given those limitations, but he can contribute for this team.\n\nThere's been speculation that the Young trade could be a precursor to a move for Anthony Davis. It's important to note that McCollum and Kispert's deals can't be combined in any outgoing trade for the rest of this season. That Davis deal would likely involve Kristaps Porzingis' expiring salary as a centerpiece, along with picks and prospects from the Hawks.\n\nWe will have to see what the Hawks do with their added flexibility before we judge this move fully. For now though, this looks like a trade that they felt like they had to make. It's worth debating whether they could have tried to recoup some of his value before trading him, but the Young era was clearly stalling out. This gives them a fresh chance at something bigger and better. Give them credit for making a tough decision, parting with their franchise star.\n\nThe Wizards had a glaring need at point guard. They paid almost nothing to add Young, who I had as the no. 8 player in the league at that position during the preseason.\n\nThe cost for the Wizards was pretty low. At age 34 and on the last year of his deal, McCollum was never going to be a part of the team's long-term plans. Kispert is a nice role player but replaceable.\n\nThis also doesn't hurt the Wizards too much financially. They were projected to have over $80 million in cap space this summer per Spotrac's Keith Smith. Even with Young's added money, they still have room to be active in free agency.\n\nYoung will help the Wizards young players develop. Despite his offensive decline, he still does generate advantages at a prodigious rate. He will create open looks for everyone else.\n\nAlex Sarr stands to benefit the most. Young is a great lob passer, and Sarr should have some easy finishes at the rim as a part of that new tandem.\n\nIn making this trade, the Wizards get a low-commitment look at Young. And he becomes another big expiring contract next season that they may be able to flip for positive value next year. It's not unrealistic to think that he can raise his value, given that he is only 27 years old and in one of the worst shooting slumps of his career.\n\nThere is some downside risk here for the Wizards. They owe the Knicks a top-eight protected pick in the upcoming draft and currently have the fourth-worst record in the league. If Young improves their team too much, then they could end up giving a juicy pick in the back end of the lottery to New York. They'd surely rather keep their pick, but that level of internal improvement wouldn't be the worst outcome in the world.\n\nMORE: Luke Kornet finally found NBA success, simply by letting go",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- Injuries and health issues have defined the Philadelphia 76ers for the better part of two years now. The Sixers were expected to contend for a championship in 2024-25 after bringing in Paul George, but they went 24-58 as injuries decimated the roster.\n\nEven though they have been winning in 2025-26, the Sixers have still been snake-bitten a bit as players have been in and out of the lineup. Philadelphia has just not been able to find any type of rhythm or consistency in terms of their lineups.\n\nHowever, in Wednesday's 131-110 win over the Washington Wizards, the Sixers had their full complement of players since Dec. 18, 2023. Joel Embiid, Kelly Oubre Jr., and Trendon Watford were all available for the Sixers after initially being listed as questionable and then upgraded to probable.\n\n\"It's good,\" Embiid said. \"Just gotta keep on going, but like I said, it's all about being smart, and do it the right way, but, you know, I guess good accomplishment, but it's just got to be consistent, which we've been.\"\n\nNo Sixers are unavailable for tonight's game because of injury or personal reasons.\n\nPer my notes, this is the first time that has happened since 12/18/23.\n\nTonight will be the 11th time Nick Nurse has coached a fully healthy version of Sixers. It is his 199th game with the team.\n\n— Adam Aaronson (@SixersAdam) January 7, 2026\n\nEmbiid had 28 points, seven rebounds, and two blocks in 25 minutes. This comes after he played 40 minutes against the Denver Nuggets on Monday. The big fella is continuing to string games together and it's all great things for him and the Sixers to continue building on as time moves forward.\n\n\"I feel good,\" Embiid stated. \"Pretty good. Just gotta keep it going. I thought, tonight, I was OK tonight, so that's a good sign. Like I said, just gotta keep going. We’re still building myself back up. You just have to be smart.\"\n\nThe Sixers will begin a 3-game road trip on Friday when they take on the Orlando Magic and then head up to Toronto for a back-to-back with the Raptors. It will be interesting to see how Embiid is handled in terms of his minutes and which game he plays in against the Raptors.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Joel Embiid reacts to Sixers finally being fully healthy vs. Wizards",

    "description": "Ethan Nwaneri had a breakout season last term - but the young Arsenal forward is in a fight for the game time needed to fulfil his promise.",
    "fullText": "Ethan Nwaneri had a breakout season last term when the Arsenal forward deputised so impressively for the injured Bukayo Saka.\n\nHe played mostly on the right wing and scored nine goals in 37 appearances in all competitions to mark himself out as one of England's most talented young players.\n\nNwaneri, now 18, also became the second-youngest goalscorer in Champions League history when he netted against Girona last January at 17 years and 314 days old - only Jude Bellingham did so at a younger age.\n\nThe England Under-21 forward is the youngest player to feature in the Premier League thanks to a debut against Brentford at the age of 15 years and 181 days in September 2022.\n\nSo, as well as those admirable performances in 2024-25, it also feels as though Nwaneri has been on the first-team scene for a long time.\n\nYet this season, his involvement has been limited.\n\nNwaneri has made 11 appearances in all competitions, starting just three times across matches in the Carabao Cup and Champions League. He has played just 446 minutes and has scored one goal.\n\nThe Gunners spent about £250m bringing in eight players over the summer to increase the depth in their squad, with Martin Zubimendi, Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and even the younger Noni Madueke 'win now signings'.\n\nIt has worked, with Arsenal five points clear at the top of the Premier League and with a perfect record in the Champions League.\n\nMikel Arteta's side have won 23, drawn four and lost just two of their 29 matches and if they beat Liverpool in the league on Thursday, they will be eight points clear of Manchester City.\n\nBut those experienced signings, and Arsenal's success, has come at a cost to younger members of the squad like Nwaneri.\n\nIt is not only Nwaneri who has seen less game time this season - the same also goes for fellow academy graduate Myles Lewis-Skelly.\n\nLewis-Skelly also took his chance during Arsenal's injury crisis last season, making 42 appearances in all competitions including in both games of the Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid.\n\nThe full-back's performances were so good that he was given an England debut by Thomas Tuchel, scoring against Albania in a 2-0 win.\n\nBut like Nwaneri, Lewis-Skelly has stalled this season, starting just one Premier League game.\n\nThat is down to the fitness and form of Riccardo Calafiori, who has been excellent at left-back, and the signing of the equally versatile Piero Hincapie on loan with the option to buy for about £45m.\n\nBoth Nwaneri and Lewis-Skelly signed new five-year deals in the summer as they committed their future to their boyhood club following breakthrough seasons.\n\nNwaneri's future was under more discussion, before he signed the contract that will keep him in north London until 2030.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport there was interest in the midfielder from Borussia Dortmund - and there were also reports linking him to Chelsea - before Nwaneri signed his new deal.\n\nIt is understood Nwaneri is fully committed to succeeding at Arsenal and that if there was any chance of him leaving it would have been in the summer during discussions about his contract.\n\nWith the January window open and Nwaneri's lack of game time, there has been speculation about whether he will go out on loan.\n\nThat is not something being considered by either the club or the player, with the feeling that Nwaneri will learn more by being around a title challenge and training with players such as Saka, Eze and Martin Odegaard than going elsewhere for more minutes.\n\nNwaneri's taste of regular minutes last season has raised his expectations, but having to fight for game time at a club like Arsenal has not surprised him.\n\nThere were discussions about Nwaneri's pathway into the team in the summer as part of the talks to conclude his new contract.\n\nDespite Nwaneri being able to play centrally - his preferred position - and on the right is a boost to his hopes of more action, but the success of £48.5m Madueke and £67m Eze have created a lot of competition for those spots.\n\nArsenal play nine times in total this month - with fixtures in the Premier League, in the FA Cup against Portsmouth and in the Champions League - so there is every chance he will get game time in which to shine.\n\nNwaneri will know he must capitalise on those chances if he is to have more involvement in the second half of the season and the opportunity to develop his undoubted talent.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Notre Dame loses two more players to the transfer portal on Wednesday, three total\n\nIt was a rough day for Notre Dame football and the transfer portal, but you can pretty much say that been the whole experience since the window opened last weekend.\n\nThe Irish saw linebacker Preston Zinter enter early in the morning, but the bad news kept coming throughout the day. A few hours later, another linebacker, this time Anthony Sacca put his name into the portal according to 247Sports’ Chris Hummer. The freshman linebacker did not see the field this fall, as he entered the program as a 4-star prospect out of Pennsylvania. His father played for Penn State, so there is an early connection there.\n\nTo make matters worse, another freshman, wide receiver Scrap Richardson also will transfer according to On3’s Pete Nakos. Like Sacca, he didn’t see the field during his first season in South Bend, but his outlook was always a long-term on. Richardson played mainly quarterback in high school, but still was a 4-star athlete coming out of Georgia.\n\nNotre Dame is still searching for its first transfer portal commitment, as they continue to see their roster thinning out during the last five days. Eventually the tide will turn, but it’s been a very frustrating start to the portal window.\n\nNotre Dame true freshman LB Anthony Sacca has entered the transfer portal, @mzenitz and I have learned. \n\nHe ranked as a 4-star recruit in the @247Sports Composite. https://t.co/VcAmcBs3ku pic.twitter.com/yg5k1d9URF\n\n— Chris Hummer (@chris_hummer) January 7, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Notre Dame lost a pair of players to the portal, three on Wednesday",

    "fullText": "Coaches for teams in the wild card round won't be available for head coaching interviews until next week and one of the assistants who is seen as likely to see some interest is Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula.\n\nShula is in his second year as a coordinator and he's been with the Rams since 2017. Being a Sean McVay assistant is generally a good path to a head coaching job and Shula adds to that by being McVay's college roommate as well as the grandson of the legendary Don Shula.\n\nOn Wednesday, Shula said he took time during the summer and the team's bye week to prepare for potential head coaching interviews. That's allowed him to be \"locked in on that routine\" ahead of this week's game against the Panthers while waiting to see \"if the right situation presents itself\" in this cycle.\n\n“I think that’s the goal of any coach that wants to be in this league,” Shula said, via Greg Beachum of the Associated Press. “That doesn’t mean you’re just going to walk away for any opportunity. I love it here, and my family loves it here. We’ve been here nine, 10 years, coaching with my best friend. We obviously have a great group of players and a great staff. So for the right opportunity, we’ll see.”\n\nThe Rams defense was part of the reason for the 3-3 finish that ended their hopes of taking the top seed in the NFC, but a rebound in Carolina would put them right where they want to be and it wouldn't do anything to hurt Shula's chances of making the next step up the coaching ladder.",

    "fullText": "The Wisconsin Badgers continued their hot streak in the transfer portal on Wednesday, as the program added sophomore transfer running back Bryan Jackson from USC. The 6-foot, 235-pound halfback from McKinney, TX, didn't see a ton of carries during his USC career, but he flashed real signs of potential during both the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Jackson had a solid outing in the Trojans' Music City Bowl matchup against Texas A&M in 2024, rushing for 66 yards on 16 carries, while scoring a touchdown en route to a bowl victory.\n\nJackson is slotted to be the second or third option at running back, most likely behind both Abu Sama III and Darrion Dupree. His ability to break tackles and accelerate made him popular with USC fans. That ability should translate to Wisconsin, as new running backs coach Jayden Everett reshapes his position group.\n\nExpect Wisconsin to rely heavily on the ground game next season, especially after the additions of quarterback Colton Joseph, Sama, and now Jackson. Given how the offensive roster is shaping up, we could see shades of traditional Wisconsin football in 2026.\n\nBREAKING: USC transfer RB Bryan Jackson has Committed to Wisconsin, his agent tells @On3sports\n\nThe 6’1 230 RB has totaled 72 carries for 311 yards and 5 TDs in 2 seasons with the Trojans\n\nHe’ll have 2 years of eligibility left\n\nRepped by @coachzwillhttps://t.co/RlUbB6EMhS pic.twitter.com/We7ak0YTG5\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) January 7, 2026\n\nContact/Follow @TheBadgersWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Wisconsin Badgers news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Badgers Wire: Wisconsin football running back transfer Bryan Jackson USC",

    "fullText": "Speaking after Liverpool’s most recent game against Fulham, star centre-back Virgil van Dijk looked ahead to his team’s next fixture against Arsenal.\n\nThe Dutch international admitted he’s aware that Arsenal are still yet to lose a game at the Emirates Stadium in all competitions in 2025/26, but he believes Liverpool have the opportunity to end that run.\n\n“They have a fant­astic squad,” Van Dijk said. “We all know at home they are unbeaten this sea­son in all com­pet­i­tions. So we should be ready for a big fight.\n\n“There is no reason to not look for­ward to it. It’s another oppor­tun­ity.”\n\nIt’s not unreasonable for Van Dijk to suggest Liverpool could end Arsenal’s unbeaten run at home, considering Arne Slot’s side are one of just two teams to beat the Gunners in all competitions this season.\n\nBut the other team was Aston Villa, and Arsenal got revenge on Unai Emery’s side with a 4-1 victory just last week. Mikel Arteta will be telling his players they now have the chance to do the same against Liverpool.\n\nYet perhaps Liverpool will come to the Emirates with less to lose than Villa. Villa were playing to stay in touch with Arsenal at the top, whilst Liverpool’s best-case scenario is that they end the day 11 points behind the Premier League leaders. At worst, it will be 17.\n\nIf Liverpool can play with the pressure off, maybe that could give them an edge over an Arsenal side trying to win their first title in decades.\n\nOn paper, it’s certainly one of the tougher fixtures Arsenal will face in the coming weeks, and the same is true for Liverpool. With the chance to go eight points clear at the top or end an unbeaten run, this game could provide a major morale boost to the winner.",

    "fullText": "One centre-back has confirmed he is joining Liverpool with immediate effect.\n\nIt has become apparent that Richard Hughes needs to fortify the defensive back line at Anfield.\n\nRight now Arne Slot has just three senior centre-back options available. Giovanni Leoni's injury has led to a shortage of options with Joe Gomez also constantly getting little niggles.\n\nIbrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk have therefore had to play a lot of of the games so far this season, and that's been a burden on them.\n\nAt the same time, because of Liverpool's lack of depth Slot has had to keep Wellity Lucky and Amara Nallo around from the academy, even though they are probably ready to go out on loan.\n\nBut this could be changing in the coming weeks. January is an opportunity for Liverpool to address some of these issues.\n\nAnd it looks like the club is working on it.\n\nMor Talla Ndiaye is set to join from Amitie FC in Senegal, and another young centre-back has now also confirmed he is joining the club.\n\nNoah Adekoya took to his Instagram account to share pictures of him posing with a Liverpool shirt and putting pen to paper on a deal in a confirmation that he is joining the club.\n\nThe 19-year-old joins from Burnley and is believed to be extremely highly rated. He has participated in Nigeria's U20 international squad and it's not the first time he spent time at Liverpool either.\n\nAdekoya had a trial at the club when he was younger and was unable to join due to injury.\n\nHe ended up going to Burnley instead, where he captained the club's U18 side and now in a serendipitous way he is back at Liverpool.\n\nIn terms of the expectation for him, Adekoya is probably joining to allow Lucky and Nallo to leave on loan. Similar to Nat Phillips who joined around the same age from Bolton, he is very much a player who will be starting for the U21s.\n\nBut like Phillips, who benefited from Liverpool's lack of depth, there will be first-team opportunities for him.\n\nWe've seen Lucky sit on the bench numerous times already this season. Adekoya could benefit from similar opportunities.\n\nSo, this is a transfer to keep an eye on. He is very much one for the future. Being only 19-years-old means he is still a relative baby when it comes to centre-back years.\n\nAt Liverpool he will be given the space and the room to grow and develop, while allowing Nallo and Lucky to push on in their development as well.",

We want to go forward,\" he said early in the 2025 season.\n\nCristobal is content to write his own script for this chapter of Miami football, but there is no doubt the ultimate goal is going where some of the iconic Hurricanes teams of the past went and winning national championships.\n\nHere's a look back at Miami's national title history and the last time the 'Canes were champions.\n\nMORE: Why 'the U' may finally be back\n\nMiami has claimed five national championships in its history: 1983, 1987, 1989, 1991 and 2001.\n\nWhile Auburn and Washington have national title claims in 1983 and 1991, respectively, the Hurricanes were the consensus national champion among the major polls in 1983 and were champions according to the AP Poll in 1991.\n\nThe Hurricanes' run in the 1980s and early 1990s lives in university lore. After overcoming an early loss and winning their last 11 games to capture a title under Howard Schnellenberger in 1983, Miami went 79-8 between 1985-92, winning one national title under Jimmy Johnson and two under Dennis Erickson.\n\nIn 2001, Miami returned to glory with an undefeated championship under Larry Coker.\n\nMiami's last national championship came in 2001, when they used what they believed was a snub from the BCS championship game in 2000 as motivation.\n\nAfter Butch Davis left to coach the Cleveland Browns, Coker ascended from the offensive coordinator role and took over a Hurricanes program loaded with talent. He simply didn't lose in year one, with Ken Dorsey, Clinton Portis, Andre Johnson, Jeremy Shockey, Ed Reed, Jonathan Vilma and Antrel Rolle among the stars on the team.\n\nMiami made easy work of Nebraska in the Rose Bowl, winning 37-14 and bringing a national championship back to South Florida for the first time in a decade.\n\nMiami never reached the College Football Playoff before 2025. The Hurricanes did not make the four-team playoff in any of its 10 seasons, and they fell just short of the first expanded 12-team playoff in 2024.\n\nThe Hurricanes took full advantage of their first playoff bid by upsetting both Texas A&M and Ohio State in the opening two rounds.\n\nMORE:Revisiting 2003 BCS title game between Miami, Ohio State\n\nHere are the 10 best seasons in Miami history, by winning percentage:\n\nMORE:Why Carson Beck left Georgia for Miami",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ole Miss Rebels will take on the Miami Hurricanes in the College Football Playoff Semifinal.\n\nWhen looking at the bracket, this is undoubtedly a surprising matchup for the Fiesta Bowl. Ohio State and Georgia were the clear favorites to meet in this semifinal.\n\nEspecially with the drastic changes forced upon Ole Miss, no one took them seriously without Lane Kiffin. The Rebels have looked motivated under new head coach Pete Golding. Ole Miss appointed him as the permanent head coach soon after Kiffin departed for LSU—Kiffin, who reportedly wished to coach the team through the playoffs.\n\nWith Kiffin being denied the right to coach his team further, he's been making it known that he's watching and supporting the Rebels from afar. After all, he certainly has a monetary incentive for wanting his former school to win the national championship.\n\nSome believed Kiffin would have shown up to the Sugar Bowl, as it was in New Orleans. However, there were no sightings of the former coach rooting on the Rebels in person.

Ole Miss is listed as a 3-point underdog.\n\nSurprisingly, Kiffin is still receiving bonus pay from Ole Miss's CFP run. He was awarded an additional $250,000 following the Rebels' first-round victory over Tulane and $500,000 for defeating Georgia.\n\nIf Ole Miss manages to make it to the national championship, Kiffin would receive $750,000, and if they were to win it, Kiffin would pocket $1 million.\n\nMORE: Lane Kiffin's complete history of controversial exits in football\n\nThe LSU position was an irresistible opportunity for Kiffin. The program's legacy of national championships and its record of producing NFL draft picks offered Kiffin the chance to achieve greater success as a head coach.\n\nHe was the head coach at Ole Miss for six seasons, finishing with a 55-19 record. He departed from Ole Miss soon after the Rebels' regular season concluded with a victory over Mississippi State. That win contributed to Ole Miss achieving its first-ever 11-win season.\n\nHowever, after the win, Kiffin's official announcement of his decision was reportedly postponed because he tried to keep coaching his team during the playoffs.\n\nWe'll see if Kiffin ends up cheering on his former team in Glendale.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOle Miss was one of the original members of the SEC, which has dominated college football in the 21st century, but the Rebels haven't always been winners on the national stage.\n\nOver a 14-year stretch between the 1970s and 1980s, Ole Miss won six or fewer games each season. In the 2000s, the Rebels suffered four consecutive seasons or at least eight losses.\n\nIn the 2020s, success has found its way back to Oxford. Much of the credit belongs to Lane Kiffin, but the Rebels proved in the immediate aftermath of his departure for LSU that the program is much more than one man.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Ole Miss' championship history and whether the Rebels have won a national title.\n\nMORE:Trinidad Chambliss transfer timeline, from Ferris State to Ole Miss\n\nBecause of the strange, convoluted way college football crowned national champions in the past, the answer is not totally settled. Ole Miss claims three national championships: 1959, 1960 and 1962. However, the NCAA has only acknowledged the Rebels as a national champion once, in 1960. Ole Miss shares that title with Minnesota.\n\nThe AP Poll and United Press International Poll, the two major polls at the time, never recognized Ole Miss as a champion, as they ranked Minnesota above Ole Miss in 1960. After Minnesota lost the Rose Bowl, however, the Football Writers Association of America voted for the Rebels as the 1960 national champion.\n\nOther NCAA-sanctioned selectors chose Ole Miss as the national champion in 1959 and 1962, though the AP and UPI Polls did not.\n\nOle Miss' most recent and only NCAA-recognized national championship came in 1960, though the program has a claim to a national title in 1962.\n\nThe Rebels finished 10-0-1 in 1960, settling for a 6-6 tie against LSU but otherwise carving through much of their schedule. Ole Miss outscored its opponents 118-18 over its final four games and narrowly finished behind Minnesota in the AP and UPI polls, which crowned the Golden Gophers as national champions before bowl season.\n\nAfter Minnesota lost the Rose Bowl and Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl, the Football Writers Association of America recognized the Rebels as national champions.\n\nThe 1960 Ole Miss team was coached by Johnny Vaught and was quarterbacked by Jake Gibbs, who finished third in Heisman Trophy voting.\n\nOle Miss never reached the College Football Playoff before the 2025 season.\n\nWhile the Rebels would have made a 12-team format in 2021 and 2023, based on their final ranking, they never cracked the four-team playoff and made their College Football Playoff debut against Tulane in 2025.\n\nMORE:Complete winners, losers from Lane Kiffin's move to LSU\n\nHere are the 10 best seasons in Ole Miss history, by winning percentage:\n\nMORE:What to know about Trinidad Chambliss' Michigan roots",

    "fullText": "Thomas Frank has defended himself after a picture emerged of the Tottenham manager holding an Arsenal-branded coffee cup before Spurs’ defeat by Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Wednesday evening.\n\nFrank walked around the pitch before kick-off holding the cup, which displayed the club crest of Tottenham’s bitter north London rivals.\n\nLeaders Arsenal were the previous visitors to the Vitality Stadium, having celebrated a 3-2 success at the ground on Saturday.\n\n“I definitely didn’t notice it,” Frank said of the cup. “I think it’s fair to say we’re not winning every single football match so it would be absolutely, completely stupid of me to take a cup with Arsenal’s (emblem on).\n\n“They have been in the changing room the game before us. It’s normal to take a cup, give me an espresso, I do that before every game, so I think actually it’s a little bit sad in football that I need to be asked a question about that.\n\n“We’re definitely going in the wrong direction if we need to be worry about me having a cup with a logo of another club. Of course I would never do that. That’s extremely stupid.”\n\nThe Dane's unfortunate gaffe sparked outrage among sections of Spurs' disgruntled fanbase after pictures circulated on social media. Further pressure was piled on Frank as Antoine Semenyo bid a likely farewell to Bournemouth by firing home a dramatic added-time winner.\n\nJoao Palhinha’s bicycle kick looked set to earn Frank a reprieve after first-half goals from Bournemouth duo Evanilson and Junior Kroupi overturned Mathys Tel's early opener. But Cherries star Semenyo, who is on the verge of a £65m move to Manchester City, smashed home his 10th goal of the season in the fifth minute of added time.\n\nThe loss left Tottenham with just two wins from their last 12 top-flight games and prompted heated exchanges between travelling fans and players at full-time.\n\n“I think it’s fair to say everyone involved in Tottenham, it’s a tough one to take today,” said Frank. “Hopefully everyone can see how hard we worked to get everything in the right direction.\n\n“Overall the performance was good, especially the second half, in a game where we deserved to get more. That is extremely painful to be part of, so of course people are frustrated - that’s natural. It’s very tough to sit here right now and we haven’t got anything out of overall a good performance.”",

    "fullText": "Philippe Bianchi, father of late Formula 1 driver Jules, has revealed his home was burgled early this week.\n\nNine karts were stolen, including the last one Jules raced ahead of his move to single-seaters. Bianchi went on to win the F3 Euro Series in 2009 and eventually competed in Formula 1 for two years. He died in July 2015 from injuries he sustained in a horrific crash in the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka.\n\nHis family has lamented an act that “reopens an immense wound” and condemned “a symbolic, intimate and deeply distressing offence”. They called on the thieves’ responsibility, hoping to retrieve the karts and protect Jules’ legacy.\n\nBianchi’s former mechanic and family friend Dominique Guillien also spoke out against the thieves: “You didn’t pick the wrong door… but the wrong life. What you took isn’t mere equipment. It has little to no commercial value, for an obvious reason: you’ll never be able to use it. It is identified, traceable and unusable on a karting track.\n\n“Most importantly, it belonged to Jules Bianchi. A man, a driver, a child from the karting community. A name that all enthusiasts know, respect and keep close to their hearts. Jules left such a mark that even a five-year-old would know his story, his bravery, his humanity.\n\n“Baby Karts can be used only with an exemption, on very few tracks. Their value is low, but the emotional weight of the theft is huge. The day you attempt to use them, you’ll immediately be recognised, exposed… and your children too will understand what you did. When you stole this equipment, you didn’t just take items. You reopened a wound. You stole a legacy. You hurt Jules’ parents and loved ones again.\n\n“Being a thief, in itself, is a downfall. But persisting would be a choice. It is not too late to set things right. Drop this equipment in a location where it can be returned to his family. Do it. For them. For you. Some things can’t be bought, can’t be resold… and should never be stolen.”\n\nJules Bianchi’s breakthrough F1 season – in his own words\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

I don't even understand how that would happen.\"\n\n— Chris Vannini (@ChrisVannini) November 19, 2025\n\nOn Nov. 20, a week before the Mississippi State game, Kiffin had a meeting with Ole Miss AD Keith Carter. Although a resolution or formal announcement was expected to come from it, Carter released a statement saying that a formal announcement would come after the Egg Bowl:\n\nLet’s lock in and focus on keeping the Golden Egg! pic.twitter.com/5xPfDozhl2\n\n— Keith Carter (@KeithCarterOM) November 21, 2025\n\nAlthough there were plenty of distractions surrounding Ole Miss in the days leading up to the Egg Bowl, the game was an important one. With a loss, Ole Miss was likely out of the CFP entirely. Although Kiffin didn't address his future, he did discuss the noise surrounding the program in the recent days:\n\n\"This noise ... this has been going on for weeks. This isn't new for us.\"\n\nLane Kiffin on the rumors swirling about where he'll coach next season 👀\n\n(via @SECNetwork)pic.twitter.com/hHJ6AIlHCA\n\n— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) November 28, 2025\n\nOle Miss defeated Mississippi State 38-19. After the game, Kiffin told ESPN sideline reporter Taylor McGregor that he was still unsure about what he was going to do about his future and that he would have \"a lot of praying\" to do as he made his decision.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon following the Egg Bowl, Kiffin met with the Ole Miss AD again. Although LSU remained 'very confident' it was going to land Kiffin, the prolonging of a decision put things slightly in doubt.\n\nIn the evening hours, LSU reportedly finalizing its deals with Kiffin was delayed by Ole Miss' playoff hopes. It was later reported that Kiffin wanted to finish the season with Ole Miss through its playoff run, while simultaneously threatening to poach players if he could not.\n\nCBS Sports later confirmed reports of Kiffin threatening to take players and staff to LSU with him:\n\nThe Ole Miss coach wasn't going to leave for Baton Rouge without a fight, though. In a conversation described as tense, Kiffin didn't want to back down from his desire to coach the team through the postseason.\n\nWhen Ole Miss showed no interest in allowing him to do so, Kiffin, according to sources, threatened to take the offensive staff with him immediately if Carter and Boyce didn't relent. They held firm; Kiffin would not be coaching the team in the playoff.\n\nAs word of Kiffin's tactics spread, multiple Ole Miss football players confronted him in his office Sunday about it. Kiffin refused to directly answer whether he had told his on-field offensive staffers that if they didn't get on the plane with him to Baton Rouge the next day, they wouldn't have a spot on his LSU staff.\n\n\"I'm not making them go,\" Kiffin told the players. \"They can do whatever they want.\"\n\nSunday morning on Nov. 30 still had plenty of drama. A 9a.m. central time team meeting Kiffin had scheduled was pushed to 1 p.m.. By 3 p.m. Eastern, Kiffin made it official with an announcement via X:\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) November 30, 2025\n\nGreeted with boos and middle fingers from Ole Miss fans, Kiffin boarded a private plane to Baton Rouge. During an interview with ESPN's Marty Smith, Kiffin stated that although he wanted to coach the team through the playoff, he respected the school's decision\n\nMy interview with @Lane_Kiffin prior to his departure from Oxford to Baton Rouge.\n\n•Why he chose LSU over Ole Miss\n•Why he wasn’t in Sunday’s Ole Miss team meeting\n•His response to not coaching Ole Miss in the playoff\n•Why this took so long\n•Peter Carroll’s important msg pic.twitter.com/GfBkE7fnHU\n\n— Marty Smith (@MartySmithESPN) December 1, 2025\n\nEven after Kiffin was officially introduced at LSU, he touched on his tough decision to leave Ole Miss, as well as his desire to coach the Rebels through the playoff.\n\n\"Extremely difficult decision,\" Kiffin said in his introductory presser at LSU the following Monday. \"In that, we tried every single thing possible to continue to coach the team through the playoffs and to continue to coach the players. In the end that was their decision, and we totally respect that and appreciate the time and energy that we tried to figure out a plan to do the best thing at the time for those players.\"\n\nKiffin leaving Ole Miss didn't come as much of a surprise. LSU, one of the best college football jobs in the country, has the type of talent and resources that Ole Miss simply cannot match. In his presser, Kiffin added that he relied on mentors like Pete Carroll, who channeled his father, Monte Kiffin.\n\n\"I felt like everybody that I talked to outside of the state that I was in all basically said the same thing, Kiffin said. \"They all said, man, you are going to regret it if you don’t take the shot and you don’t go to LSU. It’s the best job in America with the best resources and to win it. It’s obviously been done here before by a number of people.\n\n\"Pete Carroll, really he told me that he always told my dad that he would look out for me. When we were talking, he really channelled him from knowing him for so long, and he said, this is exactly what he would do. He would tell you, boy, go get it; go for it.\"\n\nAlthough several Ole Miss assistants followed Kiffin to Baton Rouge, including offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr., running backs coach Chris Smith and linebackers coach and tight ends coach Joe Cox, only a few are remaining with the team through Thursday's Fiesta Bowl.\n\nPer ESPN on Jan.6, Weis Jr. and Smith are expected to continue coaching Ole Miss against Miami on Thursday evening. Other assistants that followed Kiffin like Cox and receivers coach George McDonald are expected to stay behind.\n\nMORE:Ranking the four remaining 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nLane Kiffin signed a seven-year, $13 million contract with LSU, which will earn him close to $91 million. His new salary makes him one of college football's highest-paid head coaches, right there with Georgia's Kirby Smart.\n\nOle Miss reportedly was set to match LSU's reported offerings around $13 million a year, but it's unclear if the numbers matched LSU's exactly.\n\nKiffin's salary in 2025 was right at $9 million per USA Today, which made him the 11th highest-paid head coach in college football. According to the Clarion Ledger, Kiffin signed a six-year extension worth $54 million in 2023 with Ole Miss.\n\nAlthough the numbers for 2025-26 aren't public just yet,  LSU reportedly also is set to commit $25-30 million per year for roster-building with Kiffin.\n\nA 2024 estimate had Ole Miss' roster from last season costing $10 million. You can guesstimate that number is higher for big-name stars like Trinidad Chambliss, Kewan Lacy and others, but it's nowhere close to LSU's reported commitment under Kiffin.\n\nKiffin compiled a 55-19 overall record in six seasons at Ole Miss, and he left as the school's third winningest head coach.\n\nMORE: Bowl season winners & losers",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ole Miss Rebels are continuing their College Football Playoff run. Despite losing head coach Lane Kiffin to LSU in late November, Ole Miss has surprised everyone with its 2-0 CFP record, including an upset win over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl.\n\nIt’s an impressive effort led by new Ole Miss head coach Pete Golding, who was previously the Rebels’ defensive coordinator. Another factor in Ole Miss’ success is that the team has been able to use Kiffin’s former assistants -- even those following him to Baton Rouge -- during the playoff.\n\nThat ends now, however, as not all of Kiffin’s future assistants will be on the sideline when Ole Miss takes on Miami in the CFP semifinal. Let’s take a look at which coaches will and won’t be on hand for Ole Miss’ Fiesta Bowl matchup with the Hurricanes.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal\n\nWeis Jr. is the son of former Notre Dame and Kansas head coach Charlie Weis. Weis Jr., 32, has been coaching at the college level since 2011. He started as a Florida offensive quality control coach in 2011 before serving as Kansas’ team manager from 2012 to 2014. He was an analyst at Alabama under Nick Saban from 2015 to 2016 and spent a season with the Atlanta Falcons in 2017.\n\nHe first teamed up with Lane Kiffin at Florida Atlantic in 2018, serving as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. The two spent two seasons together before Kiffin moved to Ole Miss. Weis Jr. went to South Florida instead, where he coached for two seasons as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. He then reunited with Kiffin at Ole Miss in 2022.\n\nWeis Jr. will head to Baton Rouge to become the offensive coordinator at LSU alongside Kiffin following Ole Miss’ season.\n\nCox played quarterback at Georgia from 2005 to 2009. He started coaching at Mallard Creek High School in his hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina in 2014, then spending 2015-2019 at Colorado State as a graduate assistant then tight ends coach. d then moving up to the collegiate level in 2015 at Colorado State.\n\nPrior to arriving at Ole Miss in 2024, he coached at South Carolina, Charlotte and Alabama.\n\nMcDonald played wide receiver for Illinois from 1994 to 1998. After a two-year hiatus from football he became a graduate assistant at Ball Stat in 2000. He's been coaching at several stops for the last two decades and a wide receivers coach, such as Minnesota, Miami, and Syracuse. He also spent two years as the Cleveland Browns wide receivers coach.\n\nMcDonald had his longest stint at NC State, where he coached from 2015-2020. He then spent two years under Bret Bielema's staff at Illinois before being hired by Kiffin at Ole Miss in 2024.\n\nKevin Smith was a standout running back at UCF from 2004 to 2007, rushing for 4,679 yards with 45 touchdowns over three seasons. He was drafted by the Detroit Lions in 2008 in the third round with the No. 64 overall pick. He spent five seasons there and transitioned to coaching after a brief stint in the CFL.\n\nHe began his coaching career at his alma mater, UCF, from 2015 to 2016, then went to Florida Atlantic from 2017 to 2019, spending three seasons with Kiffin. He followed Kiffin to Oxford for Ole Miss in 2020–2021 and again from 2023 to 2025, with a stop at Miami in 2022. He was a big reason for running back Kewan Lacy’s success in 2025.\n\nSavage earned his bachelor’s degree in exercise science from Youngstown State in 2013. He spent most of his early career in Ohio, interning at Bowling Green in 2013, Ohio State from 2013 to 2014, and Toledo in 2014. He then served as assistant strength coach at Mississippi State for two seasons before taking over as head strength coach from 2016 to 2020, after which he joined Kiffin’s staff at Ole Miss.\n\nStevens has spent most of his coaching career on the offensive side of the ball. He graduated from USC in 2019, where he started his career as an offensive quality control analyst at USC before coming to Kiffin's staff at Ole Miss as an assistant quarterbacks coach from 2022-34. He left to become the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at West Georgia, but returned to Kiffin's staff at Ole Miss after one season.\n\nChris Kiffin is Lane's younger brother. He started his coaching career in 2005, and has a number of different collegiate and NFL stops throughout his career. Primarily coaching on the defensive side of the ball, he spent time at Nebraska, USC, Arkansas State and FAU with Kiffin in 2017. He then spent five seasons in the NFL with the San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns and Houston Texans from 2018-2022 before reuniting with his brother at Ole Miss in 2024.\n\nMORE: Ole Miss vs. Miami predictions: Expert picks and odds for 2025 CFP semifinal\n\nOle Miss will have a smaller group of assistants for Ole Miss' game against the Hurricanes. ESPN first reported that offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. and running backs coach Kevin Smith will continue to coach the Rebels during its Fiesta Bowl appearance.\n\nThe staff will not include tight ends coach and co-offensive coordinator Joe Cox, receivers coach and passing game coordinator George McDonald, or quarterbacks coach Dan Stevens, all of whom were on hand for Ole Miss’ first two CFP victories.\n\n\"They have every opportunity like they have up to this point to be able to make that decision,\" Ole Miss coach Pete Golding told ESPN last week of the coaches doing two jobs at once. \"So week in and week out, I don't dictate whether they do that or not, because they're not employed by me. Up to this point, that's how it's been, and that's my expectation.\"\n\nGolding also is understanding of the current challenging college football calendar, which has the open transfer portal window through Jan. 16.\n\nPete Golding confirms Joe Cox and George McDonald are the 2 offensive coaches who will not be with Ole Miss for the Fiesta Bowl. “Do they want to be here? Damn right they do.” But notes LSU has 35 players in the portal and they have jobs they’re being paid to do.\n\n— 💫🅰️♈️🆔 (@ADavidHaleJoint) January 7, 2026\n\nCo-Offensive Coordinator, Tight Ends Coach\n\n*denotes coach is coming over from Ole Miss with Kiffin.\n\nMORE:Bowl season winners & losers\n\nKiffin reportedly wanted to coach Ole Miss during its playoff run. That was also a major reason his announcement to leave for LSU was drawn out. But with Kiffin headed to an SEC rival and the tricky recruiting calendar overlapping with the playoff, Ole Miss was not on board with the idea.\n\n\"Extremely difficult decision,\" Kiffin said in his introductory presser at LSU the following Monday. \"In that, we tried every single thing possible to continue to coach the team through the playoffs and to continue to coach the players.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNo. 5 Oregon and No. 1 Indiana meet in the College Football Playoff semifinals at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on Friday.\n\nKickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET. The game will be televised on ESPN.\n\nIt is an all-Big Ten matchup with a College Football Playoff championship berth on the line. Indiana (14-0) is no longer an underdog story under second-year coach Curt Cignetti. The Hoosiers are the favorites in this matchup, and Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza is coming off a near-flawless performance in the 38-3 blowout against No. 9 Alabama in the Rose Bowl Game.  Indiana continues to make history.\n\nOregon (13-1) dominated No. 4 Texas Tech 23-0 in the Capital One Orange Bowl, and coach Dan Lanning also is trying to guide the Ducks to their first national championship. Quarterback Dante Moore leads an offense that averages 39 points per game, and the defense is coming off a complete performance against the Red Raiders.\n\nThis is a rematch of Indiana’s 30-20 victory at Autzen Stadium on Oct. 11. Who will head to Miami for the CFP championship game at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. on Jan. 19?\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal\n\nHere is a look at the five players to watch who will determine the outcome on Friday's game:\n\nMoore finished 21 of 34 for 186 yards, one TD and two interceptions in the first meeting. How will Moore attack that Indiana defense differently this time around? He was 4 of 10 for 89 yards, a TD and an interception on passes of 10 yards or \n\nSN AWARDS: 2025 All-America team | Player of the Year | Coach of the Year\n\nMendoza finished 20 of 31 for 215 yards, a TD and an interception against Oregon in the first matchup. He finished 5 of 11 passing for 73 yards on passes of 10 yards or \n\nOregon freshman running back Jordon Davison will miss the Peach Bowl with a broken clavicle, which would almost certainly rule him out for Friday’s game. That means Whittington – a senior – would be in line for more carries against the Hoosiers’ vaunted run defense. Whittington had just five carries for 27 yards in the first matchup – and he has just 17 carries for 55 yards in two playoff games. He has some involvement in the passing game and is effective in pass protection, but Oregon needs to generate more than just a cosmetic running game against the Hoosiers this time. Will Lanning give a few more carries to freshman Dierre Hill Jr. here? Jayden Limar entered the transfer portal this week, so it’s a thin position group.\n\nFisher had 13 tackles and 1.5 sacks against Oregon. He’s the heart of Indiana’s defense, which helped limit the Ducks to 80 rushing yards on 2.7 yards per carry. That is where it starts for the Hoosiers, who did not miss a beat in the Rose Bowl against Alabama. Oregon linebacker Bryce Boettcher had 16 total tackles in that first meeting and commands a similar role for the Ducks. The tone will be set with which team can limit opportunities in the running game to put pressure on the quarterbacks. Fisher had his best games in terms of solo tackles in the tough road environments at Oregon, Iowa and Penn State. He will be locked in for this matchup at a neutral site.\n\nFinney, a freshman cornerback, had a 35-yard interception return for a touchdown in the regular-season matchup against the Hoosiers. Finney is coming off a two-interception performance against Texas Tech – a game where he also had a fumble recovery. He’s an opportunistic playmaker – and he was targeted in coverage just four times in the first meeting – where he added a pass breakup. He is the wide corner – and that will be an interesting matchup with Elijah Sarratt – who had 12 targets, eight catches, 121 yards and a touchdown in the first meeting. This could be a more frequent matchup on the perimeter in this game.",

Should Nancy not have been presented with at least one forward as the transfer window opened, given the glaring misses that blighted many of his first seven matches?\n\nHow many players will O'Neill be allowed to sign? The new boss couldn't have been clearer in the media conference that marked the third coming of the blessed one: \"we have to supplement the squad\".\n\nTwo strikers, a centre-half, potential cover at left-back and a winger would seem to be the minimum requirements. Assistant Shaun Maloney has been running the rule over possible options, it would appear.\n\nHow big is the budget and how quickly can the club get these players in the door? Now third in the table, trailing leaders Hearts by six points, the clock is already ticking.\n\nThe club's recent recruitment has been little short of woeful and this must be corrected, and quickly. Post-Nancy, there are plenty of questions. Supporters and directors alike will hope O'Neill has the answers.",

    "fullText": "What does Hotty Toddy mean at Ole Miss? Explaining the World War I origin of famous chant originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOle Miss football games are soundtracked by a familiar refrain.\n\nBetween touchdowns, canons and cheers exists a six-line sonnet that has proven especially memorable in Oxford, Miss.\n\nHotty Toddy has been a steady part of the Rebels' game day routine for the better part of a century. The chant is a rhythmic one, filled with whimsy, intensity and camaraderie like few other war cries in the nation.\n\nSo, just what does Hotty Toddy mean? The Sporting News gives you the inside scoop on all things related to Ole Miss' signature phrase.\n\nMORE: How Trinidad Chambliss went from Ferris State to Ole Miss stardom\n\nDubbed the \"unified holler of Ole Miss fans\" by the Magnolia Tribune in 2024, Hotty Toddy is the Rebels' beloved rallying cry. Its origins are mysterious, having first been published in Ole Miss student newspaper The Mississippian (now known as The Daily Mississippian) in 1926.\n\nIt's something of a mating call amongst Rebels enthusiasts, a classic call-and-response chant that exists in a similar space to other famed slogans like Mississippi State's \"Hail State\" and Alabama's \"Rammer Jammer.\" The chant itself is always preceded by a simple query: \"Are You Ready?!\"\n\nMORE: Lane Kiffin's timeline of teams coached and career record\n\nThe ensuing dialogue flows like honey, each word growing more memorable than the last.\n\nThe Hotty Toddy lyrics are as follows:\n\nHotty Toddy is undoubtedly a full-body experience. It grasps at three different senses at once. Those who deliver the chant don't merely see and hear it. They feel the rhythm, too, courtesy of a hand gesture. Most fans who utter the phrase do so while pulling off the landshark or \"Fins Up\", a simple signal which sees users point their hand sideways and bring it up to their head to mimic a shark's fin underneath waves.\n\nThe gesture began in 2008 when then-linebacker threw it up after corralling then-Rebels quarterback Jevan Snead multiple times during a summer practice.\n\nMORE: Where is Trinidad Chambliss from?\n\n\"Fins Up\" was born, a tradition that has paired harmoniously with the Hotty Toddy chant over the years.\n\nIt's unclear why the Rebels have grown so fond of Hotty Toddy. Its meaning is muddled, with different Ole Miss supporters delivering different definitions of the term.\n\nSome think it's a play on the phrase hoity-toity, perhaps a reference to the high-brow nature of tailgating typically present at Vaught Hemingway Stadium, the Rebels' home ground.\n\nMORE:How Ole Miss-Mississippi State rivalry got Egg Bowl name\n\nThere's also the case of the Hot Toddy, a tea-like cocktail that tends to feature hot water, lemon, honey and your choice of dark liquor. Some believe the chant is a nod to the famous spirit. It's quite possible that Rebels enthusiasts delivering the phrase do so as liquid courage seeps into their bellies.\n\nThere is some evidence that the phrase is derived from World War I-era banter. Still, all roads to the tagline's origins are shrouded in dust and fog. One thing is for certain, though: Ole Miss students have no interest in retiring the chant any time soon.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the first published use of Hotty Toddy took place in the mid-1920s. It is likely that the phrase was around for some time before then.\n\nMORE:11 most expensive coach buyouts in college football history\n\nThe cheer was initially known as \"Heighty Tighty\", with its lyrics slightly altered compared to its present-day version. Here's a look at the chant in its initial form, per Magnolia Tribune.\n\nHell, yeah! Damn right! \nHeighty Tighty, Gosh Almighty,\nWho The Hell Are We? Hey!\nFlim Flam, Bim Bam\nOle Miss By Damn!\n\nThe hot toddy is not believed to be related to the Ole Miss chant. However, the warm alcoholic beverage is a favorite of fans at The Grove and figures to feature prominently in the fanbase's pregame rituals, particularly when temperatures drop.",

The 2025 Bulldogs finished as national champs with a perfect 16-0 record, capped off with a 42-21 win over Harding in the national title game.\n\nMORE:Meet Pete Golding, the man that replaced Lane Kiffin at Ole Miss\n\nAlthough he received an influx of interest from schools after winning a national title for Ferris State in mid-December 2024, Chambliss didn't enter the winter transfer portal window.\n\nBut as more schools started reaching out and offering him life-changing NIL opportunities in the spring, he saw it as an opportunity he couldn't pass up. He entered the spring transfer portal window—which has since been limited by the NCAA to just one window in January—in April 2025. He committed to Ole Miss and the Rebels a couple of weeks later.\n\nHe even began the 2025 season behind Ole Miss quarterback Austin Simmons but earned the starting job after Simmons got injured in Week 3. He's thrown for a career-high 3,660 yards with 21 touchdowns and three interceptions at Ole Miss.",

    "fullText": "1952 \nThe White Sox sold catcher Al Lakeman to the Phillies. Lakeman had been purchased from the Boston Braves after the 1950 season, but spent all of 1951 in Triple-A Sacramento, with meager results. The backstop had a sub-replacement career in the majors (-2.6 WAR), producing a positive WAR in just one of his nine seasons.\n\n2001 \nJust 145 hits shy of 3,000, Harold Baines re-signed with the White Sox, marking the third time in his career he’s chosen to rejoin the team via free agency. The soon-to-be 42-year-old only gets a minor league deal.\n\nThough Baines would suit up all season, he saw action in just 32 games (11 hits) with a .131/.202/.143 slash and -1.2 WAR, and hung it up at season’s end.\n\n2008 \nRich Gossage, who was drafted by and started his career in the majors with the White Sox, was elected to the Hall of Fame. It was the ninth ballot for Gossage, who earned 33.3% of the vote on his first try, in 2000, and stalled out in the low 40s% until 2005, became the fifth relief pitcher in the Hall, preceded by Hoyt Wilhelm, Rollie Fingers, Dennis Eckersley and Bruce Sutter. Electing relief pitchers to the Hall has become a trend, making Gossage the third bullpen arm elected since 2003. Former White Sox outfielder Tim Raines earned 24.3% of votes, leading all first-timers on the ballot; somehow it would take him 10 ballots, until 2017, to be elected.\n\nGossage finished his career with 41.1 WAR over 1,809 1⁄3 innings, and his 310 saves ranks 27th all-time. In five years with the White Sox (1972-76, starting about a third of his games, he logged 9.9 WAR with a 3.80 ERA and two All-Star appearances. Gossage had a jaw-dropping 8.2 WAR — still the best-ever for a pure relief pitcher (Gossage also owns the eighth-best reliever WAR (6.0), for his 1977 season — after he was dealt in 1976 with Terry Forster to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Richie Zisk.\n\n2014 \nWhite Sox legend and second-best hitter in franchise history, Frank Thomas, was elected to the Hall of Fame on his first try, with 83.7% support. Joining him in the Class of 2014 were hurler teammates Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine. Reminiscent of fellow second baseman Nellie Fox in 1985, Craig Biggio fell just two votes shy of election.\n\nThomas played the first 16 years of his career on the South Side, and was a five-time All-Star and two-time MVP.\n\n2023 \nLiam Hendriks announced via social media that he had Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. While he didn’t discuss his health in a press conference until May, Hendriks kept his fan base informed of the varying milestones in his recovery. The White Sox closer began his baseball rehabilitation assignments on May 5 and made his return to the MLB diamond on May 29 by pitching the eighth inning of an eventual 6-4 loss to the Angels.\n\nHendriks’ season would only last five games (2-0, one save, 5.40 ERA, three Ks in five innings, -0.1 WAR) due to arm discomfort that saw him return to the IL on June 10. He would succumb to Tommy John surgery, treating an arm injury he’d apparently fought through for years, on August 2.\n\nThe White Sox declined his option after the season, triggering 10 years of $1.5 million payments through 2033.",

    "fullText": "Carson Beck family tree: Meet sister Kylie, ex-NBA cheerleader mom and more about Florida roots originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDoes Carson Beck have a girlfriend?\n\nNot many college quarterbacks can say they had a resume the caliber of Carson Beck's.\n\nWhile both of his championships came as a backup when he played for the Georgia Bulldogs, Beck still cemented himself as a starter by 2023, when he threw for 3,941 yards and had 28 total touchdowns for Georgia. Then, Beck decided to play one last year in college, transferring to the Miami Hurricanes for a reported hefty NIL package.\n\nThose around Beck have been in the spotlight often, from his past relationship with Miami women's basketball star Hanna Cavinder, to his family, including his mom and sister.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of Beck's family tree.\n\nMORE: Why did Carson Beck transfer from Georgia to Miami?\n\nCarson Beck's sister is Kylie Beck. She is a former cheerleader and member of the dance team at Georgia, where she attended at the same time as her brother.\n\nWhen the quarterback departed Georgia for Miami, Kylie Beck, a sophomore at the time, also shared that she was leaving the Bulldogs behind. It hasn't been confirmed whether she also chose to attend Miami, but she's remained a close supporter of her brother with the Hurricanes.\n\n“Thank you letter to Athens. When one door closes, another door always opens with something greater on the other side,\" Beck wrote, per The Athlete Lifestyle on SI. \"I entered this new city hoping for greatness, success and happiness. Although there are times there was an abundance of these things, there were also times when I was at the lowest I’ve ever been and my family and I went through the hardest things we’ve ever dealt with. To say this experience has been a whirlwind of emotions would be an understatement.\n\nI am thankful that I’ve been able to call Athens my home for the past five years, traveling to games to support my brother and then making my dream a reality this past year when i was awarded the opportunity to be both a Georgette & Dance Dawg. It was such a blessing being by my brothers side and cheering him on from the field.\"\n\nLike Carson, Kylie is from Jacksonville, Florida, so the quarterback's transfer to Miami was closer to their home state.\n\nWhether as a Georgia cheerleader or just as a fan, Kylie has been a very vocal supporter of her brother's football career. She's shared plenty of social media posts about Carson.\n\nKylie Beck has also become known for her gameday outfits.\n\nKylie Beck is not a cheerleader for the Dallas Cowboys. However, she was invited to dance with the Cowboys cheerleaders in March 2025, posing on the field afterward.\n\nMORE: How does NIL money work in college football?\n\nCarson Beck's mom is Tracy Beck. She grew up in Clinton, Md., went to Maryland for college and danced for the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) in the past, per The Athletic. Tracy Beck is a kindergarten teacher at Alimacani Elementary School in Jacksonville, Florida, where her kids were raised.\n\nLike the rest of Carson's family, Tracy has been a very public supporter of the quarterback's career.\n\nIn 2024, she told The Athletic that it's not \"who Carson is\" to remain in college as long as he had because of NIL.\n\n“There was no negotiating for money. That’s not who Kirby is. That’s not who this program is about, and that’s not who Carson is,” she said. “I think it’s cool he can do NIL this year and have an opportunity for all that. And those boys work so hard. I have never seen kids work as hard as they do. I mean it’s a full-time job to be a football player at the University of Georgia.\"\n\nHowever, Tracy also told The Athletic that she supports Carson's decision to buy a luxury car with his NIL money, as he's been focused on football first.\n\n“He’s so laid back and so focused on football and Georgia and his team. To him, that’s such a cool thing and be able to represent and do things for Georgia and for NIL,” she said. “But at the end of the day, talking about the car, it’s just a car. It’s very cool and amazing that he can drive something like that. But at the end of the day, it’s more about the team and coming back to try and do what they want to do this year.”\n\n\"Beck's Brigade\" is a gameday tailgate support group for Carson Beck that was started by his mother. Per Dawg Nation, Tracy Beck previously said watching Carson play always makes her nervous.\n\n“Honestly, he tells me to relax,” she said, per Dawg Nation. “I promise you that. He says ‘Don’t be nervous’ and ‘Be calm’ and ‘I’ve got this’ and ‘Tell everybody around you to not be nervous’ because it is nerve-wracking to be the quarterback’s mom and anybody’s mom.\n\n“Now some games have been close and I’ll cry at the end when we win and I’ll go out on the field.”\n\nMORE: Ranking the 19 greatest Miami players of all time\n\nCarson Beck's dad is Chris Beck. He is a former player at Navy, where he played linebacker from 1989-92, and he is now a retired Naval officer.\n\nWhen Carson Beck played for the Pablo Creek Saints, his dad was his coach, per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nMORE:Carson Beck's tattoos, explained\n\nNo, Carson Beck's parents are no longer married.\n\nIt's unknown when Chris and Tracy Beck divorced, but according to EssentiallySports, the couple met in Annapolis, Maryland, before later moving to Florida and welcoming Carson in 2002, then Kylie.\n\nMORE:History of Miami QBs in the NFL, from Jim Kelly to Cam Ward\n\nAs of January 2026, Carson Beck hasn't been confirmed to be in a relationship with anyone.\n\nPreviously, he was in a high-profile relationship with Hanna Cavinder, a basketball player at Miami and popular social media influencer. Beck and Cavinder began dating in July 2024, per People, but rumors that they had split began in March 2025, not too long after Beck transferred to Miami and joined his girlfriend as a Hurricanes athlete.\n\nAt the time, per People, Cavinder had removed all signs of Beck from her Instagram profile, while her twin sister, Haley, posted on social media suggesting she had \"a gut feeling about a relationship\" and saw \"someone in my life that's hurting.\"\n\nBeck later confirmed his split with Cavinder to ESPN, saying, \"You make mistakes as a person, but it sucks that you have to go through something like that with someone that you care about, and now it's all over the Internet.\"\n\n\"Half of what you see in the media is true,\" Beck told ESPN. \"Half of what you see is not true. So, people pick their side of the story and run with it. The people that know the truth know the truth. But it's been difficult.\"\n\nMORE: When is the last time Miami won a championship in football?\n\nCarson Beck was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. He attended Mandarin High School; in 2018, he won the Florida \"Mr. Football\" award after throwing for 3,546 yards and 30 touchdowns as a junior.\n\nBeck led Mandarin to a state championship, and after initially committing to Florida as a baseball prospect, he switched to college football. Beck first committed to Alabama, then flipped his decision to Georgia and joined the Bulldogs in 2020.\n\nHas Carson Beck won a championship?",

He is the type of player we just couldn't recruit anywhere and so having him back in February is something we're looking forward to.\"\n\nEli King is also making encouraging progress in his long term rehabilitation.\n\n\"Eli's back on the grass this week doing some straight line running,\" Barry Murphy added.\n\n\"We expect him to train with us before the end of the season.

    "description": "In the race to embrace new technologies, some ecologists fear their field is losing touch with nature.",
    "fullText": "Tadeo Ramirez-Parada studied the timing of plant flowering for his PhD — but he didn’t touch a single petal. Instead, he developed a machine-learning algorithm to analyse the digitized captions of one million herbarium specimens, which showed him how flowering times are changing with rising temperatures.\n\nRamirez-Parada’s work has helped to solve an important mystery in ecology — showing that as temperatures change, plants shift their flowering times to cope with the heat, rather than adapting through natural selection1. Yet his work so far has been almost entirely computer-based. “I have had to do very little experimental or field work,” says Ramirez-Parada, who did his PhD at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nRamirez-Parada’s work is typical of a change that is reaching into every part of ecology. Whatever scientists are analysing — digitized specimens, images of the natural world, DNA samples, or data streaming in from sensors — many are doing it indoors.\n\nThe technologies are creating a world that can be monitored at times, places and scales that were previously unimaginable. We are moving towards the “fully automated monitoring of ecological communities”, wrote Marc Besson, a marine scientist at the Sorbonne University Ocean Observatory in Banyuls-sur-Mer, France, in a 2022 paper2.\n\nMany ecologists say this revolution offers huge potential for understanding the biodiversity crisis and discerning patterns of global change.\n\nBut some ecologists are dismayed. They feel that the discipline is losing intimacy with its subject matter. They argue that field experience is in decline, and that this loss could lead to error, bias and oversimplification of results.\n\n“If it becomes a world where you don’t actually have to go out in order to become an ecologist, we kind of lose sight of what the actual world is like,” says Bill Sutherland, who studies conservation biology at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nLike scientists everywhere, ecologists are grappling with how to make the most of a torrent of data.\n\nNatural-history museums and herbariums around the world have digitized more than one billion specimens over the past few decades, some with accompanying DNA records.\n\nMeanwhile, citizen scientists and researchers alike have been feeding databases such as iNaturalist with hundreds of millions of observations, which are absorbed into the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a central database for natural history.\n\nThere is also a stream of data from sensors such as camera traps — which take pictures when activated by movement — microphones, animal-tracking devices, drones, satellites and DNA samplers.\n\nSuch sensors can run for years without intervention. Once, a remotely planted camera trap would eventually run out of power: now, the energy consumption of such a device is minimal and it can rely on solar or wind energy. Bandwidth is no longer an obstacle to data being transmitted 24 hours a day.\n\nAnd computer science is more than keeping up3. Artificial-intelligence systems are already identifying species from these data; they are also being used for more complicated tasks such as building species-distribution models and ancestry trees. Some ecologists predict that generative AI, which creates new content based on learning from huge data sets, will soon be able to make more complex models, leading the way to understanding ecological processes and forecasting how species will respond to environmental changes.\n\nThere are already at least 100 laboratories that would label their work as ‘AI for nature’, according to Tanya Berger-Wolf, a computational ecologist at the Ohio State University in Columbus.\n\nThe approach is starting to bear fruit. One European project, called CamAlien, is tracking invasive species using high-resolution cameras with machine-learning processing power, affixed to cars, boats and trains. As they speed along, they rapidly photograph the sides of roads and tracks, analyse the images in situ and upload alerts about alien invasive plants to a Europe-wide online map.\n\nThe system shows how, just in the past few years, new technologies combined with AI have “gone from mostly demonstrating potential to actually beginning to deliver real implementations”, says Toke Thomas Høye, an ecologist at Aarhus University in Denmark, who co-developed CamAlien. Some 16 European countries are trying out the technology to assess the distribution of invasive alien species.\n\nSimilarly, amid the steep declines in some insects, a consortium of researchers has finessed camera-trap technology, originally designed to spot mammals, so that it can identify and monitor insect species, which are much more numerous. Automated insect monitoring didn’t exist five years ago, says Høye. Thanks to developments in AI, scientists can distinguish between thousands of species.\n\n“It’s opening up a door to part of our natural world that is so much more diverse compared to what camera traps have been used for previously,” says Høye. He and his group think that making insect monitoring easier and less labour-intensive will shed light on the state of insect populations around the globe.\n\nAnother group has deployed a system of microphones in search of a more detailed understanding of migration as birds fly across Europe from Norway to the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Known as the TABMON project, it is now streaming real-time soundscape data, day and night. An AI tool analyses the data and converts them into commonly used biodiversity indicators.\n\n“Having standardized ecological data on continental scales is extremely rare,” says Sarab Sethi, who studies ecosystem sensing at Imperial College London, and led the design of the microphones, “especially when it’s on the fine-scale temporal resolution that acoustics gives, across a wide range of species, and across multiple years”. The project has yet to report its first results.\n\nFew would dispute the benefits of more data and detail, but there is an ominous side effect, says Kevin Gaston at the University of Exeter, UK, who studies people’s relationship with nature: field experience is on the wane.\n\nGaston and his co-author Masashi Soga, who studies the loss of human–nature interactions at the University of Tokyo, argued in a March 2025 paper4 that there has been an ‘extinction of experience’: a widespread decline in fieldwork-based research and education, with knock-on effects on the depth of ecological understanding. They also flagged other dangers, such as reduced engagement with local communities — a practice known to be crucial for successful conservation.\n\nOthers have expressed concern about ‘AI colonialism’, a practice in which data, collected remotely in poorer countries, are siphoned off for analysis in well-equipped labs elsewhere.\n\nThere are few quantitative data available to support or challenge Gaston and Soga’s argument. One analysis5 of ecological studies published between 1980 and 2014 found that fieldwork-based studies decreased by 20% (as a proportion of the total), whereas modelling and data analyses increased by 600% and 800%, respectively. But these are relative changes, rather than absolute numbers, and the data set ends more than a decade ago.\n\nAnecdotally, however, Gaston and Soga’s paper struck a nerve. Since publication, a number of groups have cited it while warning that a lack of outdoor research is hindering studies on subjects ranging from solitary bees to dinosaur fossils.\n\nThere’s also anecdotal evidence that more computer scientists have entered ecology, excited about what they can offer, but lacking field experience. That was the case for Berger-Wolf, considered a founder of computational ecology. She completed her PhD in theoretical computer science, but, being married to an ecologist, says she would chat to others in the ecology community and walk away “with a feeling like, oh, there’s got to be a different way of answering this question”.\n\nBerger-Wolf changed tack in 2003, and by 2005 was developing algorithms for dynamic network analysis to depict the social interactions of zebras in the Kenyan Serengeti. Field colleagues urged her to go and see her data but she always refused: “I’m a city girl. And I don’t like dust and bugs. And my answer was: ‘no, my data looks beautiful on my screen.’”\n\nSethi is another convert to ecology, having arrived in the field with an engineering background. In 2016, he decided to apply acoustic monitoring to ecology for his PhD — but the self-confessed metrophile quickly found himself out of his depth in a rainforest in Malaysian Borneo.\n\n“I did what I now realize was the extremely dumb thing of trying to develop a new technology and for its first deployment to be in a tropical forest on the other side of the world,” Sethi grins. On the first night, he lay under a mosquito net in a pitch-dark hut on stilts, wide awake, while his ecologist colleagues dozed comfortably amid the sounds of the rainforest. He remembers thinking: “My God, is this just like a joke that’s gone a bit too far?” Now he values his field experiences but works mostly from the lab.\n\nSome ecologists have gone the other way, coming in from outdoors to embrace big data. Laura Pollock at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, began her career as a field ecologist, first in the swamps of New Orleans, Louisiana, and then in isolated mountain regions in Australia. She saw a need for ecologists to do better data analysis, and now she uses machine learning to do predictive modelling of biodiversity across landscapes.\n\n“I rarely get outside,” she says. “I’m trying, but it’s really hard because there’s so much technology creating so much data that we need people who have these data-science skills to analyse this.”\n\nBut Besson has embraced technology without diminishing his hours in the field. He says that he is spending as much time outside as he did before automation arrived. “Cameras and hydrophones can capture things in addition to my own eyes and ears, and they can stay in the field when I need to go back to the lab ... and when I need to sleep.”\n\nThere are also many systemic forces driving ecologists indoors, argues Gaston.\n\nThere’s a widespread perception that funding for field studies is in decline — although the data are not often differentiated into grants for fieldwork versus those for lab-based projects. Scientists who run long-term ecological studies, in particular, report that they struggle to find funding.\n\nOther contributing forces include the fact that research institutes are increasingly in urban areas; that more scientists have childcare responsibilities that deter them from doing long or far-flung trips; that many feel the need to reduce their carbon footprint and that others want to avoid ‘helicoptering’ in and out of a country to do fieldwork that local scientists could do.\n\nAnother major issue, says Sutherland, is that the fast track to career-boosting publications is to analyse, rather than physically collect, data.\n\n“Supposing you do your PhD and you spend all your time doing fieldwork,” he says. “And the person sitting next to you has been extracting data [from day one]”. After three years, he says, they might have published in increasingly highly ranked journals, while “you’re still in the Amazon catching fish”.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-04150-w\n\nRamirez-Parada, T.

    "title": "OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Health. Should we trust it?",
    "description": "The new feature helps users understand test results, get advice on diets and workouts, and prepare for doctors’ appointments.",
    "fullText": "Amid rising concerns about people relying on ChatGPT for medical advice, OpenAI made its most significant push yet into health care.\n\nThe company has launched a new feature called ChatGPT Health, which allows users in the U.S. to connect their medical records and data from wellness apps and wearable devices with ChatGPT. The tool is designed to help users understand test results, get advice on diets and workouts, and prepare for doctors’ appointments.\n\nMore than 230 million people globally ask ChatGPT health and wellness-related questions every week, according to the company. ChatGPT Health is designed in collaboration with physicians and will “help people take a more active role in understanding and managing their health and wellness,” the company said in a post.\n\nOpenAI said it will look to expand access to the feature in markets such as India, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines, where adoption is rising quickly. In these countries, overburdened health-care systems and unequal access to doctors are leading more people to turn to generative AI for guidance.\n\n“We do not have the people, the labor to deliver the care we should,” Jesse Ehrenfeld, chief medical officer at Aidoc, an Israeli medical technology company, said at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “The only way out of this mess is digital and AI.”\n\nResearchers, ethicists, and medical professionals have warned of the risks to users from biases and hallucinations in AI systems. Concern over the mental health harms that AI chatbots pose is growing. Meta’s AI chatbots provided inappropriate advice to teenagers when talking about suicide and eating disorders, Common Sense Media, a nonprofit research organization, reported last year.\n\nThe family of a teenager who died by suicide has sued OpenAI and its chief executive officer Sam Altman, accusing them of wrongful death. The company said it has safeguards in place to help people, and that it continues to improve ChatGPT’s training.\n\nThere is also the question of data privacy. Health data, particularly information related to mental disease and substance use, is sensitive, and its misuse can leave users vulnerable.\n\nWhile consumer awareness about privacy has increased, people generally do not know how their data is being used, including for marketing purposes or for tracking, Sam Siegfried, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Schulte, told Rest of World on the sidelines of CES.\n\n“The person clearly trusts an app enough to give it their data,” he said. “But they should understand what they are using the app for, and whether its data requests sync up with what they are using it for.”\n\nOpenAI said ChatGPT Health “builds on the strong privacy, security, and data controls across ChatGPT with additional, layered protections designed specifically for health — including purpose-built encryption and isolation to keep health conversations protected and compartmentalized.”\n\nThere is no stopping tech companies from entering the health sector.\n\nBesides turning to AI chatbots for health queries, people are also buying more wearable digital devices, including smartwatches, rings, bracelets, and glasses, to track physical activity, vital signs, and various physiological responses in real-time. They take this data to their doctors — or to ChatGPT — with questions on how to interpret it or use it to improve their health.\n\n“Health-related anxiety is real. AI is not as good as a doctor, but it’s better than no care at all,” Ami Bhatt, chief innovation officer at the American College of Cardiology, said at CES.\n\nOpenAI isn’t the only big tech company keen to tap the health-care sector.\n\nApple was among the first to offer health-tracking features in its smartwatch. There are millions of health-related videos on YouTube and TikTok, with nearly 60% of Americans watching health-related videos on YouTube.\n\nHealth is “one of the major use cases for Gemini,” Nichole Young-Lin, women’s health clinical lead at Google, said at CES.\n\n“People are using generative AI as a health resource around the world,” she said. “The patient-physician relationship is very important, but health-care access is not equal. Patients feel empowered with generative AI.”",

    "fullText": "The narrative from the AI labs is dazzling: build AGI, unlock astonishing productivity, and watch GDP surge. It’s a compelling story, especially if you’re the one building or investing in the new thought machines. But it skips the part that makes an economy an economy: circulation.\n\nAn economy is not simply production. It is production matched to demand, and demand requires broadly distributed purchasing power. When we forget that, we rediscover an old truth the hard way: You can’t build a prosperous society that leaves most people on the sidelines.\n\nIn The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, the visionary poet and painter William Blake (writing during the first Industrial Revolution) put the circulatory logic perfectly: “The Prolific would cease to be prolific unless the Devourer as a sea received the excess of his delights.” In other words: Output has to be consumed. The system has to flow.\n\nToday, many AGI narratives assume that the “prolific” can keep producing and the broad mass of customers (“the devourer”) somehow continue to buy, even as more and more human labor is displaced and labor income and bargaining power collapses. That’s not a future of abundance. It’s a recipe for a kind of congestive heart failure for the economy: Profits and capabilities accumulate in what should be the circulatory pump, while the rest of the body is starved.\n\nSo if we want an AI economy that makes society richer, we need to ask not just “How smart will the models get?” and “How rich will AI developers, their investors, and their immediate customers get?” but “How will the value circulate in the real economy of goods and services?” Not “What can we automate?” but “What new infrastructure and institutions are needed to turn capability into widely shared prosperity?”\n\nTwo versions of the future are often discussed as if they are separate. They’re not.\n\nI’m excited by the discovery potential of AI. It may help us solve problems that have defied us for decades: energy abundance, new materials, cures for diseases. As Nick Hanauer and Eric Beinhocker put it so well, “Prosperity is the accumulation of solutions to human problems.” That AI can grow the store of solutions to human problems is a wonderful dream, and it should be our goal to make it come true.\n\nBut discovery alone is not the same thing as economic value, and it certainly isn’t the same thing as widely shared prosperity. Between discovery and economic value lies a long, failure-prone pipeline: productization, validation, regulation, manufacturing, distribution, training, and maintenance. The valley of death is not a metaphor; it is a bureaucratic, technical, and financial landscape where many promising advances go to die. And from that valley of death, the path follows either an ascent to the broad uplands of shared prosperity, or a shortcut to a dead-end peak of wealth concentration.\n\nIf AI accelerates discovery but doesn’t accelerate diffusion, we get headlines and paper wealth, but broad-based growth takes much longer to arrive. We get a taller peak, not a wider plateau.\n\nThe distribution question begins with choke points. Who owns the discovery engines? Who controls access to compute, data, and the models themselves? Who captures the IP? Who has the channels to bring new capabilities to market? To what extent do incumbents and the moats they have built restrict innovation? Do government regulatory processes also speed up, or do they keep AI adoption at a glacial pace? Do those at the choke points use their market shaping power wisely? If those choke points are tight, the discovery economy becomes a kind of discovery feudalism: The breakthroughs happen, but the spillovers are limited, adoption is slow, and the returns concentrate.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the tools and standards of diffusion are broadly available, if interoperability is real, if licensing is designed for many routes to market, if regulatory processes can also be sped up with AI, then the discovery economy can become what we want it to be: a generalized engine of progress. There’s a huge amount of work to be done here.\n\nMany of the questions are economic. If discovery becomes cheap, does the rest of the pipeline get cheaper, or does it get more expensive to compensate for other lost revenue? The happy dream is that a cancer vaccine becomes available at the marginal cost of production. The unhappy reality may be that the drug manufacturers conclude “We have to price this high to make up for our losses from the existing drugs that people no longer need to buy.” Even in an age of cheap discovery, it is possible that some vaccines will still cost millions of dollars per dose and only be available to people who can afford them.\n\nThe other story is labor replacement. We are told that AI will substitute for a great deal of intellectual work, much as machines replaced animal labor and much of human manual labor. Businesses become more efficient. Margins rise. Output increases. Prices fall and spending power increases for those who are still employed.\n\nBut who are the customers when a large number of humans are suddenly no longer gainfully employed?\n\nThis is not a rhetorical question. It is the central macroeconomic constraint that much of Silicon Valley prefers not to model. You can’t replace wages with cheap inference and expect the consumer economy to hum along unchanged. If the wage share falls fast enough, the economy may become less stable. Social conflict rises. Politics turns punitive. Investment in long-term complements collapses. And the whole system starts behaving like a fragile rent-extraction machine rather than a durable engine of prosperity.\n\nIn a 2012 Harvard Business Review article, Michael Schrage asked a powerful strategic question: “Who do you want your customers to become?” As he put it, the answer to that question is the true foundation of great companies. “Successful companies have a ‘vision of the customer future’ that matters every bit as much as their vision of their products.”\n\nIn the early days of mass production, Henry Ford reportedly understood that if you want mass markets, you need mass purchasing power. He paid higher wages and reduced working hours, helping to invent what we now call the weekend, and with it, the leisure economy. The productivity dividend was distributed in ways that created new customers.\n\nFord’s innovation had consequences beyond the factory gate. Mass adoption of cars required a vast extension of infrastructure: roads, traffic rules, hotels, parking, gas stations, repair shops, and the entire social reorganization of distance. The technology mattered, but the complements made it an economy.\n\nSteven Johnson tells a related story in his book Wonderland. The preindustrial European desire for Indian calico and chintz helped catalyze modern shopping environments and global trade networks. But there’s even more to that story. When it became cheaper to make cloth, fashion, taste, and the democratization of status display became a larger part of the economy. The point is not “consumerism is good.” The point is that economies grow because desires and capabilities change as the result of innovations, infrastructure, and institutions that allow the benefits to spread. New forms of production require new systems of distribution, experience, and exchange.\n\nAI is at that inflection point now. We may be building the engines of extraordinary productivity, but we are not yet building the social machinery that will make that productivity broadly usable and broadly beneficial. We are just hoping that they somehow evolve.\n\nThis failure of insight and imagination is the Achilles’ heel of today’s AI giants. They imagine themselves as contestants in a race to be the next dominant platform, with the majority of the benefits going to whoever has the smartest model, the most users, and the most developers. This is not unlike the vision of Marc Andreessen’s Netscape in the early days of the web. Netscape sought to replace Microsoft Windows as the platform for users and developers, using the internet moment to become the next monopoly gatekeeper. Instead, victory went to those who embraced the web’s architecture of participation.\n\nNow, it is true that 30 years later, we are in a world where companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have indeed become gatekeepers, extracting huge economic rents via their control over human attention. But it didn’t start that way. Amazon and Google in particular rose to prominence because they solved the circulation problem. Amazon’s flywheel, in which more users draw in more suppliers with more and cheaper products, which in turn brings in more users, in a virtuous circle, is a great example of an economic circulation strategy. Not only did Amazon drive enormous consumer value, they created a whole new set of suppliers.\n\nSo too, Google’s original search engine strategy was also deeply rooted in the circulation of value. As Larry Page put it in 2004, “The portal strategy tries to own all of the information….We want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible.” The company’s algorithms for both search and ad relevance were a real advance in market coordination and shared value creation. Economists like Hal Varian were brought in to design advertising models that were better not only for Google but for its customers. Google grew along with the web economy it helped to create, not at its expense. Yes, that changed over time, but let’s not forget how important Google’s support for a circulatory economy was to its initial success.\n\nGoogle also provides a really good example of mechanism design to solve problems with rights holders that have economic lessons for today. When music companies sent takedown notices to YouTube for user-generated content that made unauthorized use of their IP, YouTube instead asked, “How about we help you monetize it instead?” In the process it created a new market.\n\nThe extent to which Amazon and Google seem to have forgotten these lessons is a sign of their decline, not something to be emulated. It provides an opportunity for those (including Google and Amazon, if they recommit to their roots!) who are building the next generation of technology platforms. Build a flywheel, enable a circulatory economy. AI should not be enshittified from the beginning, prioritizing value capture over broadly based value creation.\n\nAn important lesson from the internet technology revolution of the 1990s and early 2000s is that decentralized architectures are more innovative and more competitive than those that are centralized. Decentralization creates value; centralization captures it. The PC decentralized the computer industry, ending IBM’s chokehold on competition during the mainframe era. The new software industry exploded. Over the next few decades, as it became dominant, Microsoft recentralized the industry by monopolizing operating systems and office applications in the way that IBM had monopolized computer hardware. The personal computer software industry began to stagnate, until open source software and the open protocols of the internet undermined Microsoft’s centralized control over the industry and ushered in a new era of innovation.\n\nThe tragedy began again, as those who had once flourished as internet innovators in turn began to prioritize control, raising moats and extracting rents rather than continuing to innovate, leading to today’s internet oligopoly. This, of course, is what allowed the current AI revolution to happen as it did. Google invented the transformer architecture, and then published it freely, but did not itself fully explore the possibilities because it was protecting an existing business model. So it was left to OpenAI to invent the future.\n\nHowever, the AI revolution has a significant difference from the early internet. The U.S.’s current set up of large, closed models, enormous data centers for model training, and a highly concentrated cloud market has echoes of central planning, in which a small cadre of deep pocketed investors choose the winners at the outset rather than discovering them through a period of intense market competition and finding product-market fit (which involves finding products and services that users not only want but are willing to pay for at less than the cost of production!).\n\nMarket competition is important to ensuring that the economy is not reliant on a handful of firms reinvesting their profits into production. When this becomes the case, circulation can get cut off. Profits stop being reinvested and instead become hoarded, trapped within the sphere of financial circulation, from dividends to share buybacks to more dividends and less and less to investment in fixed or human capital.\n\nIf we are to realize the full potential of AI to reinvigorate and reinvent the economy, we need to embrace decentralized architectures. This might involve the triumph of lower-cost open weight models that commoditize and decentralize inference, and it also certainly entails protocols and technical infrastructure that can reduce the inherent concentrating tendencies of economies of scale and other technological moats that make concentration a more efficient mode of production.\n\nCentralization is an advantage in a mature economy; it is a disadvantage when you are trying to invent the future. Premature centralization is a mistake.\n\nIf AI labs wish to be architects of a prosperous future, they must work as hard on inventing the new economy’s circulatory system as they do on improving model capabilities. They need to measure success by diffusion, not just capability. They have to treat the labor transition as a core problem to be solved, not just studied. They have to be willing to win in the marketplace, not through artificial moats. That means committing to open interfaces, portability, and interoperability. General-purpose capabilities should not become a private toll road.\n\nCompanies adopting AI face their own challenges. Simply using AI to slash costs and turbocharge profits is a kind of failure. The productivity dividend should show up for employees not as a pink slip but as some combination of higher pay, reduced hours, profit-sharing, and investment in retraining. They must use the opportunity to reinvent themselves by creating new kinds of value that people will be eager to pay for, not just trying to preserve what they have.\n\nGovernments and society as a whole need to invest in the complements that will shape the new AI economy. Diffusion will be limited by the fragility of our energy grid, by bottlenecks in the supply of rare earths, but also by sclerotic approval processes for new construction or the approval of new innovations.\n\nGovernments must also develop scenarios for a future in which taxes on labor might provide a much smaller part of their income. Solutions are not obvious, and transitions will be hard, but if we face a future where capital appreciation is abundant and labor income is scarce, perhaps it’s time to consider reducing taxes on labor and increasing those on capital gains.\n\nOver the next few months, we intend to convene a series of conversations and to publish a series of more detailed action plans in each of these areas. Let me know if you think you have ideas to contribute.\n\nWe can build an AI economy that concentrates value, hollows out demand, and forces society into a reactive cycle of backlash and repair. Or we can build an AI economy that circulates, where discoveries diffuse, where productivity dividends translate into purchasing power and time, and where the complements are built fast enough that society becomes broadly more capable.\n\nAI labs like to say they are building intelligence. They are making good progress. But if they want to build prosperity, they also need to discover the flywheel for the AI economy.\n\nThe prolific needs the devourer. Not as a villain, not as an obstacle, but as the sea that receives the excess, and returns it, transformed, as the next wave of demand, innovation, and shared flourishing.",

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Pentagon pizza theory is the informal observation that spikes in fast food orders, particularly pizza delivery orders, near U.S. government buildings such as The Pentagon, CIA headquarters, and the White House often occur right before a major international crisis.[1]\n\nThe theory is also referred to as the Pizza Meter[2] or the Pentagon Pizza Index.[3][4]\n\nIn 1990, Frank Meeks, a Domino's franchisee in Washington, told the Los Angeles Times about an extraordinary observation of some unusual late-night deliveries to the Pentagon, CIA and the White House. Meeks had noted that on August 1, the CIA had ordered a one-night record of 21 pizzas, and the following day Iraq invaded Kuwait, starting the Gulf War.[5] At first, Meeks thought it was just a coincidence, but he observed a similar surge in deliveries in December 1998 during the impeachment hearings of Bill Clinton.[6] In response, Wolf Blitzer, CNN's Pentagon correspondent at the time, remarked \"Bottom line for journalists: Always monitor the pizzas\".[7] Similar to the Pentagon pizza observation is the observation that gay bars in Washington, D.C. see abnormally low traffic on nights that workers stay late at the Pentagon.[8]\n\nIn August 2024, an X account was created known as the \"Pentagon Pizza Report\" which monitors live visit data on Google Maps in Arlington, though it has no insight on actual order volume or where pizzas are being delivered.[8]\n\nIn 1983 and 1989, surges in pizza orders to the Pentagon were noted by Domino's franchise owner Frank Meeks the night before the U.S. military invasions of Grenada and Panama.[8] On August 1, 1990, the CIA ordered 21 pizzas in a single night ahead of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait the following morning, which sparked the Gulf War. Meeks claimed that pizza orders in the Washington area also increased prior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm in 1991.[1] In January 1998, immediately after the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal made headlines, Meeks stated the White House placed $2,600 in orders to Domino's across three days.[9] In December 1998, during the impeachment hearings of Bill Clinton and launch of Operation Desert Fox in Iraq, the White House ordered \"32 percent more extra-cheese pizzas than normal\", with $11,600 worth of orders in Capitol Hill.[9][1]\n\nOn April 13, 2024, unusually high activity at a Papa John's in Washington D.C., according to observations of Google Maps' popular times graph, coincided with Iran's launch of drones into Israeli territory.[10] On June 12, 2025, at 7 p.m. EDT, the \"Pentagon Pizza Report\" account noted a \"huge surge in activity\" in Google's live visit data at the District Pizza Palace, which is two miles (3.2 km) away from the Pentagon. At 8 p.m. EDT, Israel conducted a bombing campaign against Iran, triggering a war between the two countries.[11][12]. On June 22, 2025, at 10:38 p.m. EDT, high levels of activity were reported at a Papa John's two miles from the Pentagon one hour before Donald Trump announced U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities.[13][14]\n\nBetween the late hours of January 2 and the early morning of January 3, 2026, unusually high activity was again observed at a Papa John's near the Pentagon. This coincided with the lead-up to the United States strikes in Venezuela.[15][16] Following the strikes, President Donald Trump announced the capture of Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were subsequently flown out of the country to face narcoterrorism charges. The surge in pizza orders preceded the official confirmation of the operation by several hours, during which Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez reported the couple as missing.[17]\n\nZenobia Homan, a senior researcher at the King's College London Centre for Science and Security Studies, responded to the theory with skepticism, pointing out the potential for confirmation bias. Homan stated \"I'm not saying [the theory is] wrong, but I want to see way more data. When else do spikes occur? How often do they have absolutely nothing to do with geopolitics?\".[11]\n\nIn a statement to Newsweek in 2025, the Department of Defense denied the theory, claiming that the Pentagon has numerous internal food vendors that are available to late-night workers. It criticized the accuracy of the timeline provided by the Pentagon Pizza Report.[18][19]",

    "fullText": "Google and chatbot-building startup Character.AI have agreed to settle multiple lawsuits from families whose teenagers died by suicide or hurt themselves after interacting with Character.AI's chatbots.\n\nThese negotiations are among the first settlements in lawsuits that accuse AI tools of contributing to mental health crises and suicides among teenagers.\n\nOpenAI is facing a nearly identical lawsuit over the death of a 16-year-old, while Meta has come under scrutiny for letting its AI have provocative conversations with minors. As these companies race to develop and monetize their AI chatbots, they're spending big to make large language models sound more friendly and helpful, and ultimately keep users coming back.\n\nIn October 2024, Florida-based Megan Garcia filed a lawsuit against Character.AI, alleging that the company, which lets people have in-depth and personal conversations with AI chatbots, was responsible for the death of her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III. He had died by suicide months earlier.\n\nA Wednesday court filing in the Garcia case said that an agreement was reached with Character.AI, its founders, Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, and Google. In 2024, the search giant hired the founders of Character.AI, who were former Google employees, and paid for non-exclusive rights to use the startup's technology. The startup remains a separate legal entity.\n\nThe terms of the settlements were not immediately available\n\nThe defendants have also settled four other similar cases in New York, Colorado, and Texas, according to court documents from this week.\n\nMatthew Bergman, the legal representative of the families, along with Google and Character.AI, did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nGarcia's suit said that the startup failed to implement safety guardrails to prevent her son from developing an inappropriate and intimate relationship with its chatbots. The suit claimed that he was sexually solicited and abused by the technology, and the chatbot did not respond adequately when Setzer began talking about self-harm.\n\n\"When an adult does it, the mental and emotional harm exists. When a chatbot does it, the same mental and emotional harm exists,\" Garcia told Business Insider in an interview last year. \"So who's responsible for something that we've criminalized human beings doing to other human beings?\"",

    "fullText": "Silver prices are likely to remain volatile even after last year's historic rally, as market bottlenecks continue to distort prices, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe turbulence is being driven less by a global shortage of silver than by where the metal is physically held, wrote Goldman analysts Lina Thomas and Daan Struyven in a Wednesday note.\n\nLondon — where global benchmark silver prices are set — has been left with unusually low inventories after metal was pulled into US vaults last year amid concerns that Washington could impose tariffs.\n\n\"Thinner inventories have created conditions for squeezes, where rallies accelerate as investor flows absorb remaining metal in the London vaults and reverse sharply when tightness eases,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nThe spot silver price is around $76 per troy ounce, up 8.5% so far this year after prices more than doubled in 2025, far outpacing gold's gains.\n\nSilver's historic rally reflected investor inflows tied to haven buying, expectations for Fed easing, and asset diversification. The London inventory squeeze is amplified these moves.\n\nGoldman says extreme price moves are likely to persist in both directions.\n\nUnder normal conditions, a weekly net demand of about 1,000 metric tons would typically lift silver prices by roughly 2%. Goldman estimates that sensitivity has surged to about 7% in the current environment.\n\nDespite the rally, Goldman said investor demand may not be overstretched.\n\nSilver ETF holdings — which are backed by physical silver — remain below their 2021 peak and could rise on rate cuts and as investors continue to diversify.\n\nPrices could pull back if policy clarity prompts silver to flow out of US vaults and back to London, but lingering policy uncertainty may keep metal stranded, wrote Goldman. Most gold has stayed in New York COMEX vaults even after Washington clarified last year that gold would remain exempt from tariffs, the bank added.\n\n\"If silver follows the same pattern, most silver may remain in New York COMEX vaults and extreme price action could persist even after a definitive statement on US silver tariffs,\" Goldman's analysts wrote.\n\nAdding to the volatility, China — a leading silver exporter — introduced new restrictions on January 1 requiring official approval for outbound shipments.\n\nThe move risks fragmenting the global silver market, reducing liquidity, and amplifying price swings, the Goldman analysts wrote.\n\n\"Disruption risk may prompt participants to secure their own stockpiles rather than share buffers globally,\" they wrote.\n\n\"This shift from a pooled global system to isolated regional inventories would create an inefficient structure — transforming a smooth, integrated market into one prone to sharp, localized price swings,\" they added.",

GitHub had an early lead because of its popularity as a place to store code. Lately, though, GitHub has faced more competition from AI tools such as Cursor and Anthropic's Claude Code.\n\nMicrosoft in January 2025 formed a new group focused on building AI tools under ex-Facebook engineering boss Jay Parikh. The group, called CoreAI Platform and Tools, combined Microsoft's developer division, AI platform team, and GitHub.\n\nStill, Microsoft and GitHub have remained somewhat separate, and the company has been moving people and resources around over the past few months to better coordinate efforts such as sales, one of the people said. The latest change, happening this week, is moving a small group of Microsoft engineers over to GitHub.\n\nThe goal, the people said, is to better compete with AI coding tools that rival GitHub Copilot, while getting in the race to build AI agents and fulfill Parikh's vision to build an \"agent factory.\"\n\nIn an internal meeting late last year, Parikh spoke about needing to overhaul GitHub to compete with Cursor and Claude Code, according to audio reviewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code,\" Parikh said at the time. \"We want it to be the center of gravity for all of AI-powered software development.\"\n\nMicrosoft wants GitHub's AI tools to be available wherever developers work, not just inside one app, to wants to make GitHub a kind of dashboard for managing multiple AI agents.\n\nThe latest changes are also part of what Parikh said would be new investment in improving the basic parts of GitHub. In the meeting, Parikh said those include making improvements to its GitHub Actions tool that automates building, testing, and deploying code, analytics and insights tools so teams can see how their code is performing, security for keeping the code safe, and making sure the company can meet local data storage rules to offer GitHub in new countries.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Common Gap links high school graduates to paid jobs at startups as an alternative to attending college.",
    "fullText": "The college application season is well underway, and high school seniors are facing some big decisions. Chief among them: What about a gap year?\n\nNow, a new program wants to formalize that path. Common Gap, launching Thursday, aims to match ambitious teens taking a year off before or during college with startup jobs.\n\nDelaying, dropping out of, or skipping college altogether have long been popular in Silicon Valley. Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Larry Ellison have all done some version of it. As artificial intelligence hype draws young founders to San Francisco, programs at companies like Palantir Technologies are rolling out anti-college initiatives for high school graduates. Meanwhile, startup entrepreneurship programs like Y Combinator skew increasingly younger, as taking a gap year has become less contrarian and more mainstream for aspiring technocrats.\n\nAs part of Common Gap's program, participating startups must agree to pay the high school graduates at least $75,000 a year. Oliver Zhou, the founder of the initiative, expects most offers will exceed $100,000. Common Gap doesn't have its own funding, since the participating companies will pay the students' salaries, and it won't turn a profit.\n\nZhou sees early-career prospects as a major unlock in the AI talent race, which last summer sent offers for the most technical machine learning roles into the millions: \"Why wait for them to graduate?\" He told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nZhou, 24, wishes he had taken a gap year. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania a year early and founded Deep24, a Y Combinator-backed startup that analyzes productivity data to help users manage their time effectively, in 2024. He also previously worked as a product manager at Uber.\n\n\"If you choose to go to college, you're going very intentionally,\" he said of those who will complete the Common Gap.\n\nCommon Gap takes its name from the Common App, a platform used by college-bound students to apply to over 1,000 schools with one application.\n\nPrograms for early-career techies aren't necessarily new. The Thiel Fellowship, founded in 2011, awards early-stage founders $200,000 and requires participants to drop out of college. Some venture capital firms, like Kleiner Perkins, have programs like the Common Gap, which matches college students with internships at startups in their portfolios.\n\nSeveral startups have already signed on with Common Gap, including Austin-based SuperBuilders, which makes technology for Alpha School, an AI-powered private school. Many other partners are AI-focused — a health tech company, an insurance startup, and Zhou's Deep24. His company and others in Common Gap went through the Silicon Valley entrepreneurship program Y Combinator. Zhou is working on programming for participants who will work at San Francisco-based startups.\n\nThe application process will skip the traditional résumé drop and instead asks applicants to share \"the most impressive thing you've done or built,\" Zhou said, with an optional video interview component. Zhou is also considering using AI as an initial filter in early interview rounds.\n\n\"I certainly think that college is not right for everyone, and it has kind of become a default,\" he said. \"Being able to do real work, rather than just turning in assignments for someone to grade, is quite rewarding — and good learning.\"",

    "fullText": "Michael Bloomberg may be worth more than $100 billion, but he doesn't think that salary is everything when it comes to early jobs.\n\n\"People make the mistake of going to work for a place where they get paid the most. Particularly when you're young, that's not what life is about,\" Bloomberg said in an interview with Nicolai Tangen, the CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, that aired on January 7.\n\nJob-seekers in their mid-twenties, fresh out of school, need to focus on accumulating a range of experiences and building friendships, he said.\n\n\"All of these young people are just looking at the wrong thing,\" Bloomberg added. \"What is my position? What am I going to be called? Do I have a title or what?\"\n\nWhen he was first starting his career in banking, Bloomberg said he opted to work at a firm with a starting salary of $9,000 because he \"liked the people\" more than at a company offering $14,000.\n\nBloomberg is still working at age 83 — he said he wakes up at 5:15 and arrives at the office around 7 am every day, except Fridays — and credits part of his lasting work ethic to balance.\n\n\"You still want to be able to go out and have a life, a family. It's balancing hard work with enough time off to not get worn out,\" he said. (Other entrepreneurs, like Mark Cuban, have said work-life balance isn't compatible with extreme success.)\n\nBloomberg employs 26,000 people around the world, and the namesake said in the interview that the company has low attrition rates. He said he wants to make sure employees know there's room for upward mobility.\n\nGen Zers in particular value job flexibility and work-life balance nearly as much as, if not more than, salary.\n\nThe internet recently blew up with a debate about whether people would prefer $240,000 for an in-office job or $120,000 for a remote gig. A Business Insider survey revealed that readers are as torn as social media: 183 respondents said they'd choose the work-from-home option, and 182 opted for the doubled salary.",

    "description": "Nvidia's $20 billion Groq acquisition shows the AI industry moving from training to inference, with speed and efficiency now crucial.",
    "fullText": "For years, Nvidia's rise has been synonymous with one idea: GPUs are the engine of artificial intelligence. They powered the training boom that turned large language models from academic curiosities into trillion-dollar ambitions. But Nvidia's $20 billion deal with Groq is an admission that the next phase of AI won't be won by GPUs alone.\n\nGroq makes a very different type of AI chip called a Language Processing Unit, or LPU. To understand why Nvidia spent so much, and why it didn't simply build this technology itself, you have to look at where AI workloads are heading. The industry is moving from training models to running them in the real world. That shift has a name: inference.\n\nInference is what happens after a model is trained, when it answers questions, generates images, or carries on conversations with users. It's becoming the dominant task in AI computing, and could dwarf the training market in the future, according to estimates recently compiled by RBC Capital analysts.\n\nThis matters because inference has very different needs than training. Training is like building a brain: it requires massive amounts of raw computing power and flexibility. Inference is more like using that brain in real time. Speed, consistency, power efficiency, and cost per answer suddenly matter far more than brute force.\n\nThat's where Groq comes in. Founded by former Google engineers, Groq built its business around inference-only chips. Its LPUs are designed less like general-purpose factories and more like precision assembly lines. Every operation is planned in advance, executed in a fixed order, and repeated perfectly each time. That rigidity is a weakness for training, but a strength for inference, where predictability translates into lower latency and less wasted energy.\n\n\"The tectonic plates of the semiconductor industry just shifted again,\" Tony Fadell, creator of the iPod and an investor in Groq, wrote on LinkedIn recently. \"GPUs decisively won the first wave of AI data centers: training. But inference was always going to be the real volume game, and GPUs by design aren't optimized for it.\"\n\nFadell calls this new breed of AI chips \"IPUs,\" or Inference Processing Units.\n\nTD Cowen analysts noted this week that Nvidia's embrace of not just an inference-specific chip, but a whole new architecture, shows how large and mature the inference market has become.\n\nEarlier AI infrastructure investments were made based on training-first buying decisions. The adage used to be \"today's training chips are tomorrow's inference engines,\" which favored Nvidia's GPUs, but that's no longer the case, the analysts added.\n\nInstead, there will be an explosion of different chips inside future AI data centers, according to Chris Lattner, an industry visionary who helped develop the software for Google's TPU AI chips, which Groq founder Jonathan Ross co-designed.\n\nThis move beyond GPUs is being driven by two trends that have been reinforced by Nvidia's Groq deal, Lattner told me this week.\n\n\"The first is that 'AI' is not a single workload — there are lots of different workloads for inference and training,\" he said. \"The second is that hardware specialization leads to huge efficiency gains.\"\n\nIn a 2024 story (that aged very well), Business Insider warned readers that inference could be a vulnerability for Nvidia as rivals looked to fill this strategic gap. Cerebras built massive AI chips optimized for speed, claiming memory bandwidth thousands of times higher than Nvidia's flagship GPU offering at the time. Google's TPUs are designed to efficiently run bespoke AI workloads at blazing speeds. Amazon developed its own inference chip, Inferentia. Startups like Positron AI argued they could beat or match Nvidia's inference performance at a fraction of the cost.\n\nSo Nvidia's deal with Groq can be seen as a preemptive move. Rather than letting inference specialists chip away at its dominance, Nvidia chose to embrace a fundamentally different architecture.\n\nFadell described the deal as a \"humble move\" by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. \"Many companies miss inflection points like this due to 'Not Invented Here- driven egos,\" Fadell added. \"Jensen doesn't; he saw the threat and made it work to his advantage.\"\n\nThe economics are compelling. Inference is where AI products make money. It's the phase that proves whether hundreds of billions of dollars spent on data centers will ever pay off. As AWS CEO Matt Garman put it in 2024, if inference doesn't dominate, \"all this investment in these big models isn't really going to pay off.\"\n\nImportantly, Nvidia isn't betting on a single winner. GPUs will still handle training and flexible workloads. Specialized chips like Groq's will handle fast, real-time inference. Nvidia's advantage lies in owning the connective tissue — the software, networking, and developer ecosystem that lets these components work together.\n\n\"AI datacenters are becoming hybrid environments where GPUs and custom ASICs operate side-by-side, each optimized for different workload types,\" RBC analysts wrote in a recent note, referring to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits such as Groq's LPUs.\n\nSome competitors argue the deal proves GPUs are ill-suited for high-speed inference. Others see it as validation of a more fragmented future, where different chips serve different needs. Nvidia's Huang appears firmly in the second camp. By licensing Groq's technology and bringing its team inside the tent, Nvidia ensures it can offer customers both the shovels and the assembly lines of AI.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia has developed an NVLink Fusion technology that lets other custom chips connect directly to its GPUs, reinforcing this mixed-hardware future, the RBC Capital analysts noted.\n\n\"GPUs are phenomenal accelerators,\" Andrew Feldman, CEO of Cerebras, wrote recently. \"They've gotten us far in AI. They're just not the right machine for high-speed inference. And there are other architectures that are. And Nvidia has just spent $20B to corroborate this.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nandita Giri is a senior software engineer with experience at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. She recommends job seekers spend an hour a day learning AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nandita Giri, a 32-year-old software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy journey began with problem-solving and math long before I knew I'd end up in Big Tech.\n\nI studied at the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, in India. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google often scout talent from this school.\n\nAmazon hired me straight out of college, and I moved to Seattle in 2018. To get the job, there was a logical analysis test, and only a handful of us passed. Then came multiple interviews based on problem-solving. That's how my journey in tech began.\n\nI'm now a senior software engineer at Microsoft, and my AI skills are in high demand.\n\nWhen applying for roles at Amazon, it's not about solving problems as quickly as possible, but solving them optimally. You must carefully consider the issue so that the solution can scale and be easily maintained. Amazon has a set of leadership principles that play a key role in hiring decisions, and understanding these principles is just as important as your coding skills.\n\nOn my own time, I practiced on LeetCode, a platform for coding challenges, because I liked it, not because I was preparing for interviews. Over time, I developed a strong interest in AI.\n\nOnce I arrived at Amazon, I identified tasks and patterns that could be automated and suggested AI-based solutions to management, primarily focusing on internal workflow automation and data-driven decision support systems. That experience shaped my interest in building intelligent tools for enterprise use. Leadership gave me the green light to implement them, and I successfully integrated AI into our team's workflow.\n\nAfter working at Amazon for about four years, a recruiter from Meta contacted me on LinkedIn. I never aimed to work at Meta, but my skills opened up new opportunities. I wanted to work more deeply in applied AI, and Meta offered an opportunity to focus on building intelligent systems with large-scale data and infrastructure. It was a natural next step to grow in the AI space.\n\nI went through the interview process, secured the job, and began working at Meta in 2022.\n\nI was referred internally to Microsoft based on my work at Meta. I decided to move because I wanted to work on enterprise-focused AI products, such as Copilot, which aligns more closely with my long-term interests in building impactful tools for productivity and business transformation. I've been at Microsoft since 2023.\n\nThroughout my career, I've had multiple competitive opportunities. With each role change, my scope of responsibility, impact, and overall compensation increased.\n\nMost of what I know about AI, I taught myself. I spent hours outside work watching YouTube tutorials, reading blogs, and practicing. I started small, creating AI agents for personal tasks, like sending outreach emails. Tasks that used to take me a day or two can now be completed in under an hour.\n\nSeeing those results motivated me to keep learning. What started as a personal side project has now become a central part of my career.\n\nAmazon and Meta both incorporate fast-paced learning, but Meta's codebase is more straightforward. Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all built from a single repository, allowing you to understand the system more quickly.\n\nAmazon's codebase is huge, which makes the first year challenging, but the learning curve is worth it. Microsoft feels different altogether. It's more enterprise-focused, operating at a massive scale.\n\nAI excels at repetitive or static tasks, and our job is to monitor and guide it. Managing AI, I believe, is the future of software engineering.\n\nDemand for AI roles is skyrocketing, while traditional software engineering roles have shrunk over the last five years. Many of my friends who don't work in AI have struggled to land new offers.\n\nI recommend dedicating just one hour a day to learning AI. Within six months, you'll see real progress, and these skills will be critical for the next decade. For beginners, I recommend the following:\n\nIf I were to advise my younger self, I would tell her to focus less on perfection and more on making an impact, to take ownership early, speak up with confidence, and prioritize learning and growth over titles.\n\nLong-term growth comes from solving meaningful problems and maintaining resilience.",

    "description": "The historic run up in gold, silver, and copper could soon start to reverse, some analysts say.",
    "fullText": "The searing run-up in precious metals might be capped this year.\n\nAfter a wild rally in precious and industrial metals in 2025, forecasters think investors' voracious appetite for gold, silver, and copper is about to wane, resulting in a tumble from current levels around all-time highs.\n\nCapital Economics researchers said in a note this week that they believe the \"FOMO-driven demand\" for precious metals would likely dissipate in 2026 and potentially give way to \"just-as-rapid price falls.\"\n\nIn a separate note, the firm said it expects copper, which is currently trading around $13,200 a ton, to ease to around $10,500 a ton by the end of the year, implying a 20% decrease.\n\nIn October, the firm also said it sees gold ending 2026 around $3,500 an ounce, implying a 21% decrease from the precious metal's current levels.\n\nDavid Oxley, a chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, pointed to the rapid increase in metals in the final months of 2025, and suggested \"retail investor-driven exuberance\" could be driving some of the moves.\n\nMany of the metals that rallied, like silver and copper, rose partly due to an imbalance of supply and demand, Oxley said. Both metals are in short supply at a time when demand from data centers and other AI infrastructure is rising.\n\nBut high prices incentivize more people to recycle their metals or add to the overarching supply, he said. Meanwhile, the demand for some metals, like silver, looks like it has become \"less sensitive\" to price changes lately, one possible sign that prices could soon start to normalize.\n\n\"Looking ahead, the old adage that 'high prices are the cure for high prices' will come into play to some extent over time,\" Oxley wrote.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, and in contrast to increasingly bullish analyst forecasts, we are comfortable with our view that gold and precious metals in general will end this year lower than their current level,\" he added.\n\nSome metals are already flashing technical signals that they're overbought. Gold, for instance, appears to be the most overbought it has ever been, according to a Société Générale analysis of the metal's Relative Strength Index.\n\nSilver also appears to have begun \"overheat,\" Wells Fargo Investment Institute wrote in December, citing the metal's RSI reading.\n\nSome of the strength in precious metals lately appears to be attributable to \"speculative buying,\" Joe Mazzola, Charles Schwab's head of trading and derivatives strategy, wrote in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Hsueh, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said he saw downside for gold and silver as the Bloomberg Commodity Index undergoes its annual rebalancing in January. The index will likely trim its weightings in gold and silver to comply with certain guidelines, he said.\n\nA decline in these metals of the magnitude some forecasters are predicting would mark the reversal of what's been a historic rally.\n\nGold, a safe-haven and inflation hedge that garnered more attention from investors in 2025 amid economic concerns, finished the year up 64%, marking its best year since 1979.\n\nSilver soared 150% in 2025, also marking its best year since '79.\n\nIn New York, copper climbed over 40%, marking its best year since the Great Financial Crisis.",

    "description": "Forage, an AI-powered startup, leverages AI as a middle manager to amplify its junior employee's productivity and learning with minimal supervision.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Charles Swann, a 44-year-old founder of an AI startup based in Boulder, CO. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI founded my startup, Forage, around 18 months ago. Besides myself, I have one full-time employee who has been with the company for eight months.\n\nMy business is in the marketing technology space, and I needed someone with a deep connection to modern culture and social media. So, I hired a 24-year-old growth and brand specialist from my neighborhood. She's a college graduate with less than two years of experience, whom I started mentoring.\n\nThe challenge with hiring someone more junior is that they often lack the skills to translate their intuition into a business strategy. But over the last six months, especially since the launch of Gemini 3, we've been able to leverage AI to significantly expand the capabilities of my junior employee.\n\nWe work in the marketing technology space, helping brands understand the trends happening on social media.\n\nMy junior employee has a very intuitive understanding of what influencer and brand relationships should look like, as well as how brands should present themselves on social media.\n\nWhen she first used AI in this role, she used ChatGPT to refine her product strategy. ChatGPT was great at taking her rough ideas, refining the concepts, and then writing out the details. As we began using Gemini more frequently, the role AI played in our workflow shifted from refining to co-creating product strategy.\n\nThe increased strategic capabilities in Gemini 3 are subtle, but they make a big difference because that strategic perspective is what young professionals often miss.\n\nMy growth and brand specialist had no prior experience writing a product requirements document before getting this role. Without AI, creating this document is a heavy lift. It's essentially the initial blueprint for a new product feature, translating a business idea into the technical instructions needed to build it.\n\nWriting this type of document for complex features typically would take a skilled product manager eight to 10 hours to get it right. With Gemini, my employee can do this in four to five hours.\n\nGemini 3 has been a significant step forward. Before using it, I had the idea that we should create 70% of the final product, and AI should generate 30%. Now, it's probably 40% us and 60% Gemini, simply because it's so good at expanding and expediting.\n\nWith younger career professionals, sometimes there's a light switch that clicks, and they know what it's like to be a leader, take ownership of something, and start running with their ideas.\n\nMy employee has really demonstrated that growth. This occurred at the same time she became more sophisticated in her use of AI.\n\nAI now serves as that middle layer, helping her level up the work she produces. I hesitate to say that AI alone has allowed me to have less supervision, but as she started getting more sophisticated in her use of the AI tool, I've spent less time reviewing in detail what she's generating and more time focused on the big-picture strategy questions.\n\nThere's always a risk in relying on AI to teach my employee how to gain years of experience in seconds. Hallucinations and feedback loops can occur if someone doesn't have the experience to know when to redirect.\n\nWhat I've done to help safeguard us is create a collection of prompt starters that include a detailed background on what our platform does, the features, and how to define it, which I can copy and paste into the chat. That's been a giant time saver and helps keep it focused on relevant context.\n\nHowever, I think running into possible mistakes or hallucinations is better than moving slowly. I would rather have those mistakes come up, and we have to course correct, than not be able to move at the pace we are.\n\nAI removes some of the traditional requirements around skills and expertise I need to see in candidates. It allows me to focus more on the raw intelligence, ambition, and drive.\n\nWith my company, I'm definitely bullish on the idea that brands will need the ability to authentically understand and reflect culture more than ever before, even in an AI-driven world, to survive. That type of intuitive knowledge resides with a different group of people than those my age, in their 40s, might be able to deliver.\n\nSo, I'm less concerned with whether my employee has been in the marketing industry for 10 years and more concerned with whether they have a deep understanding of the problem we're trying to solve.\n\nI believe this hiring mindset will only grow as AI continues to transform the workforce.\n\nDo you operate a tiny team and want to share your story?

Once AI is able to remember every granular detail of a user's life, including even the small preferences they didn't explicitly indicate, it will be \"super powerful,\" he said.\n\nAltman added that it's one of the future features he's most excited about — and he's not the only one.\n\nAndrew Pignanelli, the cofounder of The General Intelligence Company of New York, a company that builds AI agents for businesses, said that memory will become the biggest focus for AI companies in the coming year.\n\n\"It will become the most important topic discussed and recognized as the final step before AGI,\" Pignanelli wrote in a blog post. \"Every model provider will add and improve on memory for their apps after seeing OpenAI's success with ChatGPT memory (like Claude just did).\"\n\nPignanelli, however, said that the industry is still a long way from perfecting long-term memory.\n\n\"Larger context windows continue to improve things, as they allow more data to be passed into the context window, which allows the agent to better read parts of a large memory index,\" he wrote, in reference to the amount of information a large language model can process in a single prompt. \"Even then, though, the vast level of detail that we need to reach to consider something AGI requires memory architecture improvements.\"\n\nEven shorter-term episodic memory hasn't been fully solved yet, he said.\n\nSolving that memory problem is the ticket to turning AI from something that feels artificial to something that seems human, he said.\n\n\"Our systems today get the interaction part right. In terms of a Turing test for interaction, we're basically all the way there. But that's only half of what's needed to make a digital self,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The first AGI will be a very intelligent processor combined with a very good memory system,\" he said.",

    "description": "Daniel Min, the 22-year-old CMO at AI startup Cluely, warns against making the mistake that he used to make when networking.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Daniel Min, the chief marketing officer at viral AI \"cheating\" startup Cluely. He's based in New York City. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was 18, people would tell me to reach out to as many people as possible because they would view me as young and eager, and they would want to take a chance on me.\n\nSo I did a lot of outreach that looked like the kind of messages I receive now: \"Hey, I'm 18. I really admire the work that you do. Would love to just hop on a 15-minute chat with you and learn more about you.\"\n\nI'm not surprised I was ghosted most of the time.\n\nThere's a difference between wanting to hop on a chat and wanting a job from someone, but even the people I was just trying to chat with would not respond to me most of the time — and it's because of two main things.\n\nFirst, I realized that 15-minute chats are incredibly taxing and they ruin my workflow.\n\nThe second thing I realized is that when I would reach out for jobs, I would communicate that I didn't know what I was good at. I would say things like, \"I'm willing to do anything. I'm willing to work for free.\" Most of the time they would ghost me because my message showed that I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nI thought they would think I'm an eager young buck, who's just trying my best and who's willing to work hard. Now that I'm on the other side, I know that if I took a chance on that student who's willing to do anything, it would take me a lot of work to onboard them, and probably cause me more pain.\n\nI know that what they want out of this experience is to learn from me. So I would need to invest time, and I don't want to hire somebody and give them a poor experience.\n\nI used to think it was risk-free for someone to take a chance on me. But over time, I realized it's high risk because they're going to invest significant amounts of time.\n\nI have a soft spot for students who say that they're kind of lost and thinking about going into a startup. I'll always at least respond to them and say, \"hey, keep your head up, and try this thing.\"\n\nIf you want to send better outreach, first, tell me what you can do. Two, don't tell me what you want to learn; show me how you can help me. And three, if you don't have the skills yet, develop them and reach out again.\n\nI haven't responded to a lot of cold outreaches, but I'll take calls here and there, usually if it's through warm intros. I've told about 20 people that if they post every day for 60 days and send me a message, I will look over their content.\n\nNot a single person has ever done that. If they're not willing to put in 60 days worth of work into something they really care about, why is it worth it? I want to know that if I hop on a call with someone and give them advice, they're going to run far with it.\n\nThat's pretty much exactly what my editor did for me. He made a whole YouTube video demonstrating that he really cares and that he's watched every single one of my videos. I asked him to edit an example video and create a Google Doc of things he thinks I could film better, and he wrote a six-page document with timestamps on exactly what I should do.\n\nAfter that, I knew he was somebody who goes above and beyond. I hired him as my part-time editor at the time, and when I joined Cluely, one of my negotiation points was that he needed to be there with me. He's no longer my editor, but now he's a full-time employee at the startup. His journey is inspiring because he took a shot and showed he could provide value.\n\nMaybe someone isn't great yet when they reach out, but I want to know that if I put hours of effort into someone, they'll learn quickly and become great.\n\nIt's also effective to send links if you're doing a cold outreach. Someone could say they generated 50 million views and I wouldn't believe them. If they send me a link — which hopefully isn't malware — I will always click on it. If I was to look for a job right now, I would link everything I've done.",

    "description": "Jackson said that faster chips aren't the big news from Jensen Huang's talk. Instead, the shifting nature of AI infrastructure is the key takeaway.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the new year by giving investors some key product updates at CES 2026, drumming up fresh bullishness about the chip titan's business.\n\nAt the high-profile industry event, Huang revealed that production has begun on Rubin, its six-chip AI platform and the follow-up to the popular Blackwell architecture.\n\nThe talk generated a lot of buzz about the future of AI demand and Nvidia's business outlook, but hedge fund manager Eric Jackson argues that the most important takeaway from the talk is much bigger than innovations in chip tech.\n\nJackson, who helped spur rallies in several stocks followed by retail traders last year, said that he thinks many investors missed the key takeaway from the event. In his view, the most important thing isn't that faster or more advanced chips are coming; it is that AI is being built as a utility-scale infrastructure designed to operate for decades.\n\n\"Most people watched NVIDIA's CES keynote and heard 'faster chips,''\" he said. \"That wasn't the message. The real takeaway was this: AI factories are now being planned years in advance — at the land, power, and shell level.\"\n\nIn short, he thinks these statements mean that AI is being treated like electricity or telecom networks, a technology that will serve as a fundamental part of everyday life.\n\n\"The CES + JPM conversations made it clear: AI factories are being planned like utilities — not experiments,\" Jackson noted. \"That changes the slope.\"\n\nAs he sees it, the shifting industry landscape is poised to create more efficient AI production, which will lead to more demand for it through new use cases.\n\nThe investor highlighted the Jevons Paradox, an economic adage that argues that when a resource becomes more efficient to use, people consume it more, not less, despite assumptions. Economist William Stanley Jevons first introduced it in the 19th century to illustrate the growing dependence on coal.\n\n\"The market's obsession with 'capex slowing' misses the point,\" Jackson added. \"If inference + agents + long-context workloads are compounding, power becomes monetizable for longer, not shorter.\"\n\nJackson added that recent AI market developments are feeding his bullish thesis on small-cap tech stocks like Hut 8, IREN, and Cipher Mining, as all three stand to benefit from an economy increasingly powered by AI.\n\n\"Most investors still ask: 'Is AI demand peaking?'\" he wrote. \"The better question now is: Who can deliver reliable power and uptime as AI becomes permanent?\"",

    "fullText": "Izzy Englander's Millennium, which recently sold off a 15% stake of the firm, has just lost its head of corporate strategy.\n\nAlexander Campbell, Millennium's head of corporate strategy since 2017, is exiting the firm, according to two people familiar with the move. Millennium declined to comment, while Campbell did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCampbell joined the hedge fund in 2015 and held a strategy role throughout his entire career at Millennium, joining the firm when it managed $27 billion in assets and leaving when it had more than $83 billion. A person close to the manager described his role as working on various projects related to the organization's priorities at any given time.\n\nMillennium has undergone tremendous growth over the past decade. In November, it hit a unique milestone for a hedge fund by selling a 15% stake of the firm to investors in a sale that valued the firm at $14 billion. The firm has also made plans to launch private market funds and continues to add teams globally.\n\nA graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Campbell worked at Vanguard before going to business school at the University of Chicago and then joining BCG for five years, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nHe is a part of the growing group of professionals who work at the biggest hedge funds but do not manage any money. As firms like Millennium have become more institutional, the non-investing side of the business has expanded its headcounts.\n\nRegulatory filings show that a majority of Millennium's 6,000-plus employees do not work in an investing role. These non-investing roles include technologists, recruiters, fundraisers, compliance officers, lawyers, and other staff, such as strategy and operations personnel.\n\nBusiness Insider mapped the dozens of executives who make up Englander's management web in 2024 (Campbell was not among them) and detailed how alums from the executive ranks of the biggest managers, such as Millennium, Citadel, and Point72, are building the next wave of hedge funds.",

    "description": "Box CEO Aaron Levie says AI will make expert knowledge widely available, leaving companies to compete on data, context, and how they deploy AI agents.",
    "fullText": "AI is rapidly turning expert knowledge into a commodity — and that shift will force companies to rethink what actually gives them a competitive edge, according to Box CEO Aaron Levie.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post this week, the cofounder and CEO of cloud-storage giant Box said that AI models are becoming capable of performing high-level knowledge work across nearly every profession, from law and medicine to strategy and scientific research.\n\nAs those tools evolve into autonomous AI agents, he said, expert intelligence will no longer be scarce.\n\n\"The question that we will have to wrestle with is, in a world where everyone has access to the same expert intelligence, how does a company differentiate?\" Levie wrote.\n\nLevie said the true advantage in an AI-driven economy won't come from having smarter models, but from giving those models access to the right proprietary information — the internal data, customer histories, workflows, decision-making patterns, and institutional knowledge that companies have built over time.\n\n\"Certainly it will be about how teams and employees use AI agents effectively,\" he wrote, \"but the ultimate force-multiplier will be the context that the agents get.\"\n\nThe idea is gaining traction across Silicon Valley.\n\nAndrej Karpathy, who was on the founding team of OpenAI, and Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke have said that \"context engineering\" — not clever prompts — is what makes AI useful at scale, while Google Cloud CTO Will Grannis and GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke have said the real skill shift is toward designing systems, data, and workflows that give AI the right context to operate.\n\nBut getting the right context into AI systems is far from simple, Box CEO Levie told Business Insider last August.\n\nHe said that feeding agents too much information can cause what he calls \"context rot,\" where models become confused and focus on the wrong details.\n\nMaking sure AI agents receive precise, accurate, and task-specific context — without overwhelming them — is now one of the central challenges in building effective agent systems, he added.\n\nThe stakes are high. Companies that can capture, organize, and operationalize their internal knowledge will see major gains in productivity and output, Levie said in his LinkedIn post.\n\n\"Those that don't will find it harder and harder to serve customers competitively,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Recession fears have cooled off in recent months as the US economy continues to prove resilient (did you see that GDP number?) and the Federal Reserve slashes interest rates.\n\nBut a labor market chart flagged by one bearish strategist on Tuesday might give investors pause.\n\nThe chart, shared in a client note from Société Générale's Albert Edwards, shows the US unemployment rate (in red) alongside its three-year moving average (dotted line). Since 1950, in eight instances where the unemployment rate has begun an uptrend and broken through its three-year moving average, a recession has followed.\n\n\"Recession is the biggest threat to equities, although in recent downturns financial problems have preceded (or caused) recessions,\" Edwards wrote in the note. \"I don't think any guru is forecasting a recession in 2026. Yet the simple correlation shown below has a 100% track record of success.\"\n\nThe chart mirrors the concept of the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which says that the US economy is in a recession when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by more than 0.5% from its lows over the previous 12 months. In other words, if unemployment rises too quickly, it signals that things are about to get worse.\n\nAlthough it had been hailed for its back-tested accuracy since its release in 2019, the gauge produced its first false reading in August 2024.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the labor market weakens materially, as Edwards' chart suggests could happen. Hiring rates and job openings remain sluggish. But other important measures of the economy's health — like consumer spending and GDP growth — remain strong.\n\nAnother signal that a recession could be on the way, according to Edwards, is a steepening of the Treasury yield curve following its inversion. However, while falling short-term rates following an inversion are usually accompanied by a floundering job market and consumer, today's economy seems to be in a stronger starting place.",

    "description": "The US brought huge air power to Venezuela in its operation to capture Maduro, and hinted at cyber capabilities. This is how it could have cut power.",
    "fullText": "Amid the revelations over the weekend about the US military raid to capture Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, was an unusual line from President Donald Trump.\n\n\"It was dark,\" Trump said. \"The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have.\"\n\n\"It was dark,\" he added, \"and it was deadly.\"\n\nUS officials shared that the American military brought tremendous force to bear against Venezuela, hitting it with a range of assets across land, air, sea, space, and cyber, among other domains, but the specifics were limited.\n\nFootage of the American raid posted to social media showed helicopters flying over largely dark areas, but with many lights still on nearby. It's unclear how wide an area may have been affected.\n\nAnalysts told Business Insider that while the most straightforward explanation may be physical damage to a power station, US expertise in non-kinetic capabilities, like a cyberattack, means multiple methods were possible, reflecting the complex face of modern warfare.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provided a few details Saturday, saying that Cyber Command and Space Command helped support Operation Absolute Resolve.\n\nAs helicopters carrying special operations forces approached the target, \"the United States began layering different effects provided by Spacecom, Cybercom, and other members of the interagency to create a pathway.\"\n\nHe added that the extraction team sent in to capture Maduro achieved total surprise, though a firefight kicked off once they arrived on target.\n\nLouise Marie Hurel, a cybersecurity expert at the Royal United Services Institute who has consulted for the United Nations, told BI that with Cyber Command, \"there's no hard evidence of what their role was.\"\n\nShe said that if it did manage to create the power outage, \"that's a pretty great and unsurprising, but still very well-calibrated, part of the operation.\"\n\nShe said it is possible that US actions in cyberspace might have helped to disable part of Venezuela's critical infrastructure, resulting in the power outage.\n\nIf the US had confirmed doing that, \"it would be the most public kind of communication of the US in terms of delivering some of those effects,\" she explained. \"But again, they haven't publicly communicated that, so it's only an assumption.\" For now, details on it are limited to really just Trump's statement.\n\nThe Pentagon directed Business Insider's queries on the president's statement to the White House, which did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLukasz Olejnik, independent cybersecurity and conflict consultant and visiting senior research fellow at King's College London's Department of War Studies, told Business Insider that if cyber operations were used, the big question is: \"Was it used to switch off electricity?\"\n\n\"We don't know that,\" he said. \"Still, its role cannot be ruled out.\"\n\nVenezuela has previously accused the US of launching cyberattacks against its infrastructure, but the US has not confirmed any involvement.\n\nAny such history would have affected how much planning the US needed to do.\n\nKurt Gaudette, the senior vice president of intelligence and services at US cybersecurity firm Dragos, who previously worked at the National Security Agency and was a senior US military officer, said how long a country planning such activities needs to prepare depends \"on what your level of access was over time.\"\n\nIf the US had years of access, for example, under its own intelligence approvals, \"then they could move a lot quicker.\" Cyber is not the only way to turn off the lights, though.\n\nThe US said it deployed more than 150 military aircraft for the operation, including fighter jets, helicopters, drones, and bombers, and explosions were recorded in the capital city.\n\nThe US has not said that it hit any power infrastructure, and there is no independent confirmation that it did so. But Venezuelan officials said some substations were seriously affected in the attack.\n\nOlejnik said that \"the simplest explanation\" for the outages is the \"kinetic targeting of a small number of substations, transmission nodes, or distribution stations.\"\n\nGaudette said it was \"very plausible\" that only physical attacks on infrastructure were used to cut power.\n\nWithout any more information than what is publicly available, he said it's more likely that cyber and physical attacks would be involved, that the US would \"approach it in a combined arms multi-domain fashion,\" not least to minimize risk.\n\nJoint, multi-domain action is a US specialty, he said. \"They treat cyber just like they would the air, the ground, and the maritime domains. So they just add it as another domain, another planning factor in anything they do.\"\n\nEmily Harding, the director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said this week that \"a joint operation like that is really quite difficult to do.\"\n\nSetting up a cyber operation like this, she explained, \"would have taken quite a long time and an incredible skill level in order to make all those pieces come together at the right moment.\"\n\nThe US put months of planning into this operation, opening up a mix of possibilities. Olejnik said it \"would not be too difficult\" for American forces to shut off the power given the time available to prep for this mission.\n\n\"That is sufficient to build the capability,\" he said.\n\nThe US brought significant airpower into this operation, along with a deeply capable cyber force, pitting that against Venezuelan infrastructure that has been in crisis for years amid the country's political and financial issues. It has resulted in blackouts and various other service interruptions without external interference.\n\nOlejnik said Venezuela's long-standing infrastructure troubles are \"highly relevant\" to what the US may have done there. \"The infrastructure and power grids are both less complex,\" he said, \"and some of them may contain outdated hardware and software.\"\n\nGaudette described Venezuela's cybersecurity and cyberspace situation as \"a very porous environment, very open, very susceptible to attack if the United States were to choose to go that route.\"\n\nHe shared that he suspects the US may have gone with a simple attack rather than a deeply complex one.\n\n\"I think a state actor would take the path of least resistance,\" he said, unless it just wanted to test out a new capability. While possible, Gaudette suggested the US would likely not want to \"burn a high-end capability\" in a mission like this.\n\nThe manufactured darkness plays to US strengths, especially for this type of operation.\n\nHarding, who previously held multiple national security positions, including at the CIA and National Security Council, said the US operates \"very well in darkness,\" and the vast intelligence available meant that \"we didn't need to see where we were going.\"\n\n\"We had all the technology we needed,\" she wrote, \"and we had it all mapped out.\"\n\nIf the US took action using cyberwarfare, it wouldn't be the first time that's been done. Hurel said Russia's actions in Ukraine are \"the clearest example that we have of that kind of cyber effect supporting military action precisely.\"\n\nShe pointed to the Russian government hacking group Sandworm, which targets Ukraine's power grid and caused blackouts that coincided with Russian missile attacks.\n\nKinetic strikes are key to this mission as well. Russia uses its drone and missile barrages to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing frequent outages. The tactic has created a new worry for the West about how it could protect its vital targets in a wider war with Russia.\n\nOlejnik said that both Ukraine and Venezuela demonstrate that we can now \"expect more blended operations where cyber and electronic warfare work in tandem with broader military operations.\"\n\nGaudette said both state and non-state activists are increasingly \"using similar infrastructure or tactics, techniques, and procedures.\"\n\nHe added that it shows both countries and companies how much more insight they need into their own systems to know if any adversary is probing or harming them, something that Venezuela may not have had.\n\nThe threat, he said, \"is coming. Actually, it's already here.\"",

    "description": "The Trump administration's new guidelines removed specific recommendations on how much you should drink. Having concrete numbers helped me cut back.",
    "fullText": "This time last year, I was in for a rude awakening. Despite fancying myself a purely social drinker, I learned that I went above the recommended moderate drinking limit much more often than I realized.\n\nThe CDC says even moderate drinking can increase health issues; going above the line, even more so. It recommends no more than one drink a day, which means around seven a week, for women (the amount doubles for men). Based on the NIAAA's guidance, having four or more drinks in a day counts as binge drinking, no matter how spaced out the drinks are. This was a rule I also broke fairly frequently at parties and weddings.\n\nIn 2024, I went over the healthy limits 26 out of 52 weeks, or half the time. On 19 days out of the year, I drank four or more drinks in one day. Even though I got married that year, went to multiple weddings, and traveled a lot, the numbers still shocked me.\n\nMy first step was to panic and commit to Dry January for the month. However, I knew it wasn't realistic for me to fully quit drinking. I enjoyed the social benefits of alcohol, like feeling more relaxed, and I loved the taste of wine with dinner. I just didn't want those things to get in the way of my health.\n\nPlus, going cold turkey doesn't work for everyone. In 2025, Reframe, an alcohol reduction app, analyzed its insights from over 220,000 users who self-reported their habits. It found that social settings and weekends are the most common causes of \"slips,\" and that Damp January — drinking less without abstaining — was overall a more approachable and sustainable strategy for users than Dry January.\n\nContinuing to track my drinking, I knew I shouldn't go above three drinks in a day and try not to go above seven in a week. So, I leaned into a great loophole: following my own \"one and non\" rule, or alternating my alcoholic drinks with N/A beers and mocktails.\n\nThe habit helped me cut my drinking in half compared to the year prior. In 2025, I technically drank over the healthy limit for 14 weeks out of the year (roughly once a month). The days I had over three drinks also dropped from 19 to seven.\n\nWhile my results weren't perfect, they were a vast improvement over the year before. The downstream effects were nice too: After cutting down, I slept better, got sick less often (possibly due to a stronger immune system), and found it easier to lose fat.\n\nIt can take just a few minutes for alcohol to seep into your brain. That first drink can leave you feeling a little relaxed, even euphoric.\n\nHowever, the more you drink, the longer it takes for your liver to process the alcohol. This is what causes drunkenness and all its related health risks.\n\nLike many people, I love the feeling of that first martini — so much so that I naturally want a second. Only by the end of that one, I usually feel sleepy, more prone to headaches, and less rested in the morning. Plus, if I socialized four times a week and had two drinks each time, that would be eight drinks — above the CDC's \"one per day\" recommended limit (frustratingly, this was the case most of the time I went over).\n\nThat's where N/As come in. If I alternated my drinks — what Gen Zers also call zebra striping — and chased a beer with an alcohol-free pilsner, I'd feel like I tricked my brain into feeling I had the second drink, minus any downsides. I could feel like I had two drinks over a long dinner, when I only had one.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration announced its new dietary guidelines, including recommendations for alcohol consumption. The guidelines removed any specific recommendations for daily alcohol intake, instead focusing on drinking less in general.\n\nIn a news briefing, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, stated that moderate drinking could have some benefits.\n\n\"Alcohol is a social lubricant that brings people together,\" Oz said. While he wouldn't recommend drinking alcohol in the \"best-case scenario,\" he said \"there's probably nothing healthier than having a good time with friends in a safe way.\"\n\nBut for me, and I suspect many other people as well, social drinking was why I drank \n\nMy biggest hurdles were long social outings. I'd tell myself it didn't \"count\" as much if I had three or four drinks over a 12-hour period.\n\nSwapping for N/As helped me keep the party going without regretting my life choices. Last month, I had an unusually social day: I went to a housewarming party, watched a football game at a bar, and ended the night with a friend's birthday dinner. I had five drinks in total — two of them nonalcoholic Coronas.\n\nWhat made this rule easier to follow was how easy it's become to find booze-free options. N/A beers have become ubiquitous at bars, and I feel like every restaurant nowadays boasts at least one zero-proof cocktail. The same goes for house parties: as it's become more common to be sober or sober-curious, I find there are usually N/A options around (or, I BYOB it).\n\nNow that I have the habit of tracking my drinking and trying to adhere to more rules, the only thing left is being intentional. I found that on nights when I actively thought about getting mocktails as my second drink, I was more likely to stick to the plan.\n\nSimilarly, what usually derailed me were occasions I'd assumed were free passes for drinking, like weddings or vacations. I drank the most on hiking trips (believing I'd \"earned\" a few Negronis after an 11-mile hike) and on holidays. Looking back and noticing this pattern will make it easier for me to adjust in 2026.\n\nI know I have plenty of motivation to drink less this year. My moods improved, I had more energy at the gym, and I saved a bit of money. Cheers to that.",

    "description": "Bob Sternfels, global managing partner at McKinsey, identified three human skills that he said the AI models can't do.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence is reshaping McKinsey's workforce, but the firm's top executive said there are still fundamental human skills that AI models can't do.\n\nBob Sternfels, global managing partner at McKinsey, talked about how AI is changing work at the firm during an appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday.\n\nSternfels said that last year alone, embracing AI saved McKinsey 1.5 million hours in search and synthesis, work that he says AI models are great for. He also said AI agents, of which McKinsey has 25,000, excel at generating charts and that they've made 2.5 million of them in the past six months.\n\nWith agents taking over some of that work, he said consultants are now \"moving up the stack\" and tackling \"more complicated problems.\"\n\nGiven those changes, Sternfels said McKinsey looked at which skills new graduates will need in an AI-infused world from the perspective of large employers. He identified three: the ability to aspire, judgment, and true creativity.\n\n\"What can the models not do? Aspire. Set the right aspiration,\" he said. \"Do you go to low Earth orbit? Do you go to the moon? Do you go to Mars? That's a uniquely human capability.\"\n\nSternfels said you should look to build skills around aspiring and getting others to believe in those aspirations.\n\n\"There's no right and wrong in these models, and so how do you set the right parameters?\" he said, adding humans can build the skills to set the architecture based on factors like firm values and societal norms.\n\n\"The models are inference models — the next most likely step,\" Sternfels said.\n\nHumans, on the other hand, have an edge when it comes to \"orthogonal\" work, or the ability to think outside existing patterns and land on an entirely new approach.\n\nSternfels said AI adoption is also changing how companies look for talent, adding that where someone went to school should matter a lot less.\n\nFor someone with a tech background, he said, instead of looking at where they graduated from, prospective employers should look at their GitHub, a site engineers use to showcase their work.\n\n\"Let's actually get to the content,\" he said, \"and could that actually start meaning that a wider set of people can enter the workforce with different pathways?\"",

Follow MrBeast's playbook and embrace your peers instead of seeing them purely as rivals, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bill Gurley said.\n\nGurley, who is best known for his early investments in Uber, Zillow, and Grubhub, told \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" that success in any field requires being knowledgeable about it and going to its physical epicenter, such as a city where the action happens.\n\nHowever, he added in the episode, published in December, that virtual relationships with peers and mentors can also be valuable, and gave the example of MrBeast, aka Jimmy Donaldson, the most-followed YouTuber with 459 million subscribers.\n\n\"I think far too many people have sharp elbows to peers, because they think they're climbing the ladder and they've got to beat these people, and the world's just way too prosperous to have that mindset,\" he said, adding: \"You can learn so much and get so much value from co-climbing that you should definitely do that.\"\n\nGurley said that Donaldson was \"infatuated\" with YouTube early on and would have long Skype meetings with others who shared his passion, exchanging best practices for social media success. Gurley said he first heard Donaldson share the story on a podcast, but had also spoken to him about it.\n\nGurley said Donaldson's story exemplified the importance of embracing peers, which is one of the six principles mentioned in his upcoming book on success, \"Runnin' Down a Dream.\"\n\nDonaldson shared the story on a 2022 episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" where he said that after graduating from high school, he'd talk daily on Skype with a group of four small YouTubers, sometimes from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m.\n\n\"We basically talked every day for a thousand days in a row, and did nothing but hyperstudy what makes a good video, what makes a good thumbnail, what's good pacing, how to go viral,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's new defense regulations are sending ripples through the industry, and that's a good thing, according to Palmer Luckey.\n\n\"It's good to scare people sometimes,\" Luckey, the founder and CEO of defense technology startup Anduril, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\"President Trump is saying that he wants to see defence companies building new plants, building new factories, delivering on time, and then maintaining systems cost-effectively,\" Luckey said in an appearance on \"The Close\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'd say I'm broadly aligned,\" the Anduril founder said, adding that \"trying to do more of that is why I started Anduril years ago.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump criticized major defense contractors for issuing large dividends to shareholders, doing stock buybacks, and offering \"exorbitant\" pay packages while underperforming in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe president backed his rhetoric with action, signing an executive order that would ban defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\nThe order caps defense executive salaries at $5 million, tying their annual compensation to on-time delivery, increased production, and operational improvements.\n\n\"These measures do apply in equal measure to me. I now cannot pay dividends. I now cannot do stock buybacks if I'm not investing in new plants,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Anduril founder told Bloomberg he pays himself a salary of $100,000 a year, in addition to owning \"a lot\" of Anduril.\n\nLuckey's startup, which makes autonomous weapons, is valued at $30.5 billion as of June 2025 and is considering an IPO. The company's mission is to modernize the US military through technology, including surveillance devices, air vehicles, and autonomous weapons.\n\nAs the United States hustles to modernize warfare, Anduril has emerged as the face of the defense tech boom and proved it can compete for contracts with legacy defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\n\"If these companies were doing really well, and if they were living up to their end of the bargain, I don't think you would see any action from Trump or others on this. It's really a reflection of how many problems we have with our defence industrial base,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nWithout specifying, he added that he thought some of Trump's proposals \"might be bad moves\" for the defense base, but that \"in concept,\" everything should be on the table.",

    "description": "Gen Z’s hiring nightmare is real. With fewer jobs and fiercer competition, employers are using curveball interview questions to separate candidates from the pack.",
    "fullText": "It’s no secret that getting a new job is hard, with candidates constantly complaining about the endless hoops that recruiters are making them jump through to prove they’re the perfect match, from endless rounds of interviews to 90-minute tests and presentations.\n\nBut for young people in particular, the challenge is even steeper. About a fifth of Gen Zers worldwide are classified as “NEETs” and are currently locked out of the job market. Last year in the U.K. alone, more than 1.2 million applications were submitted for fewer than 17,000 graduate roles.\n\nEven Goldman economists have admitted Gen Z’s hiring nightmare is real—and it isn’t going away anytime soon.\n\nAs millions of Gen Zers face unemployment and entry-level office roles becoming scarcer, hiring managers are being forced to get creative to find the very best candidates. So Fortune has rounded up the curveball make-or-break interview questions now shaping hiring decisions.\n\nDo you think we’re in an AI bubble? Even the experts who’ve predicted past crashes can’t seem to agree. But if you’re looking for a job right now, your opinion on all this could decide whether you get the job. Dave McCann, IBM’s managing partner for EMEA, says he now throws the curveball question in interviews as a make-or-break test.\n\nThere’s no right or wrong answer, but actually knowing where you stand could give you an edge and pique the exec’s interest. McCann doesn’t care which side you pick—he cares whether you’ve thought it through.\n\nLyft CEO David Risher likes to ask candidates: “Design a car for a deaf person.” The curveball question may sound unusual, but for Risher, it’s a quick way to “suss out” whether a candidate can put themselves in the shoes of a customer—and he got the idea from his time working with Jeff Bezos.\n\n“I want to see the candidate close their eyes and ears and imagine what that feels like, then be able to describe the experience to me in detail, including what someone in that position might need,” Risher said. “That’s how I know I’ve got someone who can build great customer-obsessed experiences.”\n\nThe question that turns its head on the interviewee and enables them to put the hiring manager in the hot seat isn’t an unusual one. But for Twilio’s CEO Khozema Shipchandler, it’s what comes next that matters most.\n\nIf your answer is a blank stare or “Nope, I’m fine,” consider yourself on thin ice.\n\n“The number one red flag for me is when someone doesn’t ask questions towards the end of an interview,” Shipchandler exclusively told Fortune. “That’s a pretty significant mark against them being curious about what they’re interviewing, the company, the way we might work together, chemistry, culture, all of those things.”\n\nAnd Denny’s CEO Kelli Valade echoed that it doesn’t really matter what you ask employers at the end of the interview—the fact that you do ask something shows you did your homework, are seriously interested and is a big green flag.\n\nPicture this: You’ve spent hours applying for the dream job and sitting through multiple interviews. Finally, you think you’ve won over the hiring manager when they ask, “when can you start?”\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking the right answer, is “straight away.” After all, you want to seem eager. But Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of U.S. trade association Consumer Technology Association, revealed that he turns candidates down who say they’re available within two weeks. “They don’t get the job, because they’ll treat us the way they treat that former employer.”\n\nIt’s not just what you say in the interview that could cost you the job. Hiring managers are also watching what you do—as early as when you walk through the revolving doors and great reception. They’re looking at how you treat staff before and after your interview, as well as, what you do with the coffee (or tea) cup you were drinking from. Hint: offering to clean it up will go down will.\n\nOther hiring managers take their prospective new hires out for a lunch interview and watch for whether they season their food before taking a bite. Why? Because putting salt (or anything) on your food before tasting it is the equivalent of judging a book by its cover and apparently, highlights a lack of patience.\n\nThat’s not all. They’re also testing you for how quickly you order, whether you wait for others to sit before sitting down to eat, the price of the items you order, and how you treat wait staff.\n\nOne consultant even revealed on X that he knows a CEO who goes as far as taking candidates for breakfast and secretly asking the servers to mess up their order “to see how they’d react.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "New York Post may be compensated and/or receive an affiliate commission if you click or buy through our links. Featured pricing is subject to change.\n\nMake no misteak — this is an unsavory obsession.\n\nFlorida tattoo shop owner Wendy Marshall is so fond of raw meat that she scarfs 2 pounds of it daily. Ground chuck, cold cuts, whole roasts, porterhouses, the bloodier the better — Marshall devours it all.\n\n“I love ripping the flesh straight off the bone,” Marshall, 28, declared before popping a marbled chunk of steak into her mouth in a clip from Wednesday’s “My Strange Addiction” premiere, provided exclusively to The Post. A loud “raw meat burp” quickly followed.\n\nEating raw meat isn’t as rare as you might think. It’s a time-honored tradition in Ethiopia and among Arctic indigenous populations — even reality TV star Heidi Montag has been known to do it.\n\nMany cultures enjoy raw meat dishes, such as the French delicacy steak tartare (finely chopped and seasoned raw beef) and the classic Italian appetizer carpaccio (thin slices of raw beef drizzled with olive oil, lemon juice and shaved parmesan).\n\nStill, Marshall’s offal diet is extreme — and potentially dangerous. Experts warn that raw meat can harbor harmful bacteria, such as salmonella, listeria, campylobacter and E. coli, as well as parasites like trichinella.\n\nAnd Marshall’s carnivorous customs do not seem particularly hygienic.\n\nEarly in Wednesday’s episode, she’s shown at a nail salon gobbling ground beef straight from a package pulled from her purse. Her nail technician was so grossed out that she refused to give Marshall a manicure.\n\n“I do understand that it’s not socially acceptable to eat raw meat,” Marshall confessed. “People kind of gag or they look at me crazy, but I don’t care.”\n\nThe Liver King can probably commiserate.\n\nMarshall said her sinewy propensity dates back to childhood, when she would chew the fat with her nana.\n\n“That was actually a way for me and her to bond,” she explained in the exclusive Post clip. “She’d come over, and we’d talk about life and just eat the raw meat together.”\n\nMarshall said her grandma died about five years ago from bladder cancer.\n\nMarshall’s romantic partner, Robert, has not taken up the mantle. His family has beef with her addiction, going so far as to pick a bone with Marshall at a cookout at her home.\n\n“I’m about to throw up,” Robert’s cousin’s wife warned as Marshall bit into a raw steak on the TLC series.\n\n“It’s a little hard to accept someone who eats raw meat at the dinner table,” she added.\n\nRobert’s family’s concerns prompt Marshall to meet with nurse practitioner Vanessa Cabrera about what’s at stake if she doesn’t chuck her habit.\n\nCabrera identified a chronic E. coli infection in Marshall’s colon from her stool sample.\n\nMost E. coli strains in the gut are harmless and part of a healthy bacterial landscape, but certain strains can cause severe illness.\n\n“It’s interesting because typically someone with that would have nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, all of that kind of stuff,” Cabrera told Marshall.\n\n“In seeing that you don’t have any symptoms, it leads me to believe that it’s been there for such a long time that your body is adapted to it.”\n\nCabrera noted that the immune-compromising bacteria have “probably become resistant to almost every single type of antibiotic.”\n\n“So if you were to get sick with any other type of illness coupled with that bacteria there, it would be very difficult for the antibiotics to work,” she added.\n\nMarshall said it was “very scary” that antibiotics might not work in a life-or-death situation.\n\nShe promised to make “healthier decisions” moving forward and set some ground beef rules for herself.\n\n“I’m not going to stop eating raw meat — I plan to eat grass-fed, only from a good source,” Marshall vowed on the episode.\n\n“No more ground at all, not even if it’s grass-fed,” she continued. “For my health, to be here for my children, and for my husband and family.”\n\nMarshall told The Post that she hasn’t consumed raw ground meat since the show filmed over the summer, “but I can’t say that I won’t try it again in the future.”\n\nShe said she has not experienced any side effects from her protein proclivity.\n\n“Other than the medical diagnosis on paper, I have no symptoms of anything, and due to myself and my family eating raw meat for so long, I do not believe anything will happen to me or my family in the future,” she shared.\n\n“If anything, it’s amazing there were no symptoms of E. coli, unlike people who don’t eat raw meat, they’d be deathly ill. We are immune.”\n\n“My Strange Addiction,” which returned to TV after a decade-long hiatus, airs Wednesdays on TLC at 9 p.m. ET/PT. You can watch new episodes live with DIRECTV’s free trial or stream next-day on HBO Max.",

    "fullText": "Fox News anchor John Roberts appeared skeptical of part of Kristi Noem’s statement about an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer killing a 37-year-old mom in Minneapolis on Wednesday.\n\nNoem, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, asserted that the incident, which claimed the life of a U.S. citizen, who has since been identified as Renee Nicole Good, was related to an ICE vehicle getting stuck in the snow.\n\n“They got stuck in the snow because of the adverse weather that is in Minneapolis,” Noem, 54, insisted during a speech earlier Wednesday—a claim she reiterated during a press conference later that night.\n\n“They were attempting to push out their vehicle and a woman attacked them, and those surrounding them, and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle,” Noem said.\n\nAs for Noem’s claim about the snow, Roberts wasn’t buying it.\n\n“I’ve seen the video several times as well—kind of gone through it frame by frame. I don’t want to describe it because you can’t see the entire scene play out,“ Roberts, 69, said.\n\n“There is an area in front of the vehicle that is obscured by the vehicle itself, so we don’t know 100 percent what happened during that incident, but what I saw of it does counteract the narrative that they were trying to push their car out of the snow—the ICE agents who were involved here, because that vehicle was clearly in the middle of the street, as it was approached by a couple of federal agents before it sped off.”\n\nAs for the rest of the incident, like how the officer—who DHS claims feared for his life—fired multiple shots at Good through her driver’s side window as the mom-of-one was driving away, Roberts merely stated that there are differing opinions.\n\n“We will wait until we get clearance to look at this video and have eyes that are more expert than mine take a look at it,” he said. “Clearly, there are very, very conflicting opinions of what happened. We have the one opinion from DHS, and then we have the other opinion from the mayor and local officials.”\n\nDHS has argued that the agent fired in self-defense after Good, the mother of a now-orphaned 6-year-old son, attempted to kill him with her car, despite witnesses saying and video showing otherwise.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged the public not to buy into the “propaganda machine” from DHS, which was found to have provided a false account of an agent shooting a Chicago woman in her car in 2025, as The New Republic reported.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also pushed back on the DHS’s dubious version of events.\n\n“This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,” he said in a news conference, adding that ICE should “get the f--- out of Minneapolis.”\n\n“We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite,” he continued. “People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now somebody is dead. That’s on you, and it’s also on you to leave.”\n\nThis video is horrific. A full investigation is needed ASAP. Sure looks like ICE just killed that woman. https://t.co/nAUMjHvbkc\n\n— Jessica Tarlov (@JessicaTarlov) January 7, 2026\n\nLater on Wednesday, Fox News’ Jessica Tarlov had a stronger reaction than Roberts to the shooting, saying it looked “ICE just killed that woman.”\n\nThe Five co-host Harold Ford Jr. questioned Noem’s account as well.\n\n“I couldn’t understand when she said it was an act of ‘domestic terrorism’ and she said the car was stuck in snow, and the officers—I think her characterization, maybe she got bad information, because her characterization seemed inconsistent with what we are seeing here,” Ford said.\n\nWhen a colleague told Ford that Noem is working with Attorney General Pam Bondi to classify the act of ramming with a vehicle “domestic terrorism,” Ford said it didn’t seem to apply in this case.\n\n“Well, she might be, but those aren’t the facts,” he said. “She had the earliest comment about this. I’m just saying, her characterization of the facts doesn’t seem to be consistent with the video that we’re seeing. Maybe she’s seeing some other video.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to DHS for comment.",

    "fullText": "It is a mark of the serenity at league leaders Hearts that what passes as big news this week is the arrival of a player who everybody knew was coming in August and the signing of a defender who is already in the building.\n\nThat is, the confirmation that Kazakhstan winger Islam Chesnokov could feature against Dundee on Sunday after finally arriving in Scotland, and the announcement that defensive lynchpin Stuart Findlay will stay beyond his loan spell from Oxford United, which was due to end in the summer.\n\nBoth illustrate a club calmly and decisively going about its business, as did the early arrival of new right-back Jordi Altena, who set up the winning goal against Livingston at the weekend just over 48 hours after the window opened.\n\nRarely do a side top of the league at this stage of a season go under the radar.\n\nBut given the tumultuous week at Celtic which saw the swift dismissal of Wilfried Nancy and the hasty return of Martin O'Neill in the wake of a shambolic Old Firm derby loss, Hearts have done just that.\n\nThings have - finally - settled down at Rangers thanks to the influence of head coach Danny Rohl, as they moved three points behind Hearts having played a game more.\n\nBut even at Ibrox the constant chatter is about who they can bring in to to help a squad which is yet to fully convince.\n\nCeltic are in the same position, with O'Neill saying on Tuesday they hope to be busy this month, having also dismissed head of football operations Paul Tisdale.\n\nDerek McInnes is in a far more comfortable position.\n\n\"I've been a manager in January when I'm looking for five, six or seven players and it's never a good situation to be in because it means you've not done your work properly in the summer,\" the Hearts boss said when asked about the early business the club had done.\n\n\"We're quite relaxed in what we're doing. I'm not saying there won't be business done but the bulk of our work was done in the summer.\"",

To win it last year was unbelievable, remarkable, but we want to try and do it again.\n\n\"Once you taste that level of success then you want to taste it a lot more than we have done in the past.

The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement that it had launched the investigation following an application from the domestic industry showing the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024.  “The dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,” the ministry said.",
    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — China escalated its trade tensions with Japan on Wednesday by launching an investigation into imported dichlorosilane, a chemical gas used in making semiconductors, a day after it imposed curbs on the export of so-called dual-use goods that could be used by Japan’s military.\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement that it had launched the investigation following an application from the domestic industry showing the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024.\n\n“The dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,” the ministry said.\n\nThe measure comes a day after Beijing banned exports to Japan of dual-use goods that can have military applications.\n\nBeijing has been showing mounting displeasure with Tokyo after new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested late last year that her nation's military could intervene if China were to take action against Taiwan — an island democracy that Beijing considers its own territory.\n\nTensions were stoked again on Tuesday when Japanese lawmaker Hei Seki, who last year was sanctioned by China for “spreading fallacies” about Taiwan and other disputed territories, visited Taiwan and called it an independent country. Also known as Yo Kitano, he has been banned from entering China. He told reporters that his arrival in Taiwan demonstrated the two are “different countries.”\n\n“I came to Taiwan … to prove this point, and to tell the world that Taiwan is an independent country,” Hei Seki said, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.\n\n“The nasty words of a petty villain like him are not worth commenting on,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning retorted when asked about his comment.\n\nMasaaki Kanai, head of Asia Oceanian Affairs at Japan's Foreign Ministry, urged China to scrap the trade curbs, saying a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable. Japan, however, has yet to announce any retaliatory measures.\n\nAs the two countries feuded, speculation rose that China might target rare earths exports to Japan, in a move similar to the rounds of critical minerals export restrictions it has imposed as part of its trade war with the United States.\n\nChina controls most of the global production of heavy rare earths, used for making powerful, heat-resistant magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the Commerce Ministry did not mention any new rare earths curbs, the official newspaper China Daily, seen as a government mouthpiece, quoted anonymous sources saying Beijing was considering tightening exports of certain rare earths to Japan. That report could not be independently confirmed.\n\nImproved South Korean ties contrast with Japan row\n\nAs Beijing spars with Tokyo, it has made a point of courting a different East Asian power — South Korea.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung wrapped up a four-day trip to China – his first since taking office in June. Lee and Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw the signing of cooperation agreements in areas such as technology, trade, transportation and environmental protection.\n\nAs if to illustrate a contrast with the China-Japan trade frictions, Lee joined two business events at which major South Korean and Chinese companies pledged to collaborate.\n\nThe two sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.\n\nDuring Lee’s visit, Chinese media also reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from China’s mainland over the New Year’s holiday.\n\nChina has been discouraging travel to Japan, saying Japanese leaders’ comments on Taiwan have created “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan.”",

    "fullText": "More than 130 officers and staff within the Metropolitan Police, including two convicted serial rapists, committed crimes or misconduct due to significant failures in the force’s vetting processes, a review has found.\n\nDavid Carrick, one of the UK’s most prolific sex offenders, who received 37 life sentences, was improperly vetted in 2017.\n\nChecks failed to reveal a domestic abuse allegation against him.\n\nCliff Mitchell, who carried out a “campaign of rape” on two victims over nine years, was allowed to join the force in 2020.\n\nA vetting panel, partly aimed at improving diversity, overturned an initial rejection despite a previous accusation of him raping a child.\n\nThe findings highlight systemic vetting failures within Britain’s largest police force.\n\nThe 131 cases were revealed as part of a vetting review that looked at the 10 years up to the end of March 2023.\n\nOther serious crimes committed by the officers and staff include drug use, racism, violence and affray.\n\nThe review published on Thursday found that thousands of police officers and staff were not properly checked amid pressure during a national recruitment drive from July 2019 to March 2023.\n\nSenior officers at the Met chose not to meet national guidelines amid a scramble to find 4,557 recruits in a three-and-a-half-year period.\n\nThe deviations from standard practice meant thousands of references were not checked, and shortcuts in vetting led to the recruitment and retention of some officers and staff who should not have been in the force and contributed to police-perpetrated harm and damaged public trust, it said.\n\nUnder the Police Uplift Programme (PUP), forces in England and Wales were expected to recruit 20,000 officers within three and a half years to replace those cut during austerity, and funding was ringfenced and therefore lost if targets were not met.\n\nThe report found: “The review identifies a series of decisions, some of which were taken in isolation, which all compounded together and inadvertently increased risk.”\n\nIn total, 5,073 officers and staff were not properly vetted, of whom 4,528 had no special branch vetting checks, 431 had no Ministry of Defence (MoD) checks, and 114 had a vetting refusal overturned by a Met internal panel.\n\nAnother 3,338 who were due for vetting renewal had only limited checks.\n\nThe Met estimates that around 1,200 people who joined the force may have had their vetting refused under normal practices, out of around 27,300 applications.\n\nSeparately, 17,355 officers and staff did not have their references properly checked, if at all, between 2018 and April 2022.\n\nThe Met has not checked each of these files, but estimates that around 250 would not have got a job if their references had been checked.\n\nSome of the “deviations” in vetting practices led to individuals being kept on who contributed to “police perpetrated harm” and damaged the trust of the public, the report said.\n\nThe “deviations” identified included:\n\nAutomatically transferring officers from other forces without renewing their current vetting\n\nNot checking former service personnel against MoD records between at least May 2020 and September 2021\n\nNo research against special branch or counterterrorism indices between at least May 2020 to October 2020\n\nAcceptance of past clearance for former employees who had left the Met for up to a year\n\nReduced checks for officer and staff renewals, including a time when the vetting unit only looked at the police national computer instead of a full vetting review\n\nIn around April 2019 some new officer recruits joined the force before receiving national security clearance\n\nInternal processes were sped up so that many personnel security checks on Met special constables and internal staff were removed\n\nThe report also found that a since-abolished vetting panel, which aimed to tackle disproportionality in the workforce, overturned decisions to refuse vetting of 114 officers and staff, of whom 25 went on to commit misconduct or have been accused of a crime.\n\nThe review said senior officers faced political pressure and had to meet recruitment targets or lose funding to other forces.\n\nSince current Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley took over the role in September 2022, 1,500 officers have been sacked in what has been billed as a bid to clean up the force. He was also a high-ranking Met officer between 2011 and 2018.\n\nThe report said that out of 730 vetting cases reviewed, 39 officers and staff had to be rechecked, with 23 cleared.\n\nOne officer resigned, another was sacked for a different reason, six cases are ongoing, and eight have been referred to potentially face dismissal.\n\nThe report concluded: “There were deviations from policy and practice, overconfidence in the ability to recruit at scale and lack of resources in vetting increased risk.\n\n“It is extremely difficult to establish a causation chain between system changes and the potential harm caused to the public and other members of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS).\n\n“However, it is known that the scale and impact of these deviations ranged, with some tolerable and minor in nature, to those having a more substantive impact, including the recruitment and likely retention of individuals who have gone on to cause harm through criminality and misconduct – events that have undermined public confidence in the MPS.”\n\nThe Met says it has taken action to clean up the workforce and tighten vetting standards.\n\nAssistant commissioner Rachel Williams said: “In publishing this report today, we are being open and transparent about past vetting and recruitment practices that led, in some cases, to unsuitable people joining the Met.\n\n“We have been honest with Londoners on many occasions about previous shortcomings in our professional standards approach. This review is part of our ongoing work to demand the highest standards across the Met so the public can have trust and confidence in our officers.\n\n“We found that some historical practices did not meet the strengthened hiring and vetting standards we have today. We identified these issues ourselves and have fixed them quickly while making sure any risk to the public has been properly and effectively managed.\n\n“It is important to highlight that the Met recruits hundreds of officers and staff every year – the overwhelming majority of exemplary character who are dedicated to protecting the public.”\n\nPaula Dodds, chair of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: “Today’s report illustrates a farcical situation in which hitting a numerical target of recruits has taken precedence over normal checks and balances.\n\n“The good, brave and hard-working colleagues we represent are the first to say that the small minority of officers who are not fit to serve should not be in the police service.",

    "description": "\"I did that whole movie at 167 pounds. And I haven't been that light since high school,\" Matt Damon said.",
    "fullText": "Matt Damon, 55, says he made a big diet change to prepare for his latest film, \"The Odyssey.\"\n\nHe said cutting out gluten helped him slim down to 167 pounds, a weight he hadn't been at since high school.\n\nExperts say gluten-free diets are not universally necessary for weight loss or better health.\n\nMatt Damon, 55, says one diet change left him lighter than he has been in years.\n\nDuring an appearance on Wednesday's episode of the \"New Heights\" podcast, Damon spoke about how he prepared for his latest role in \"The Odyssey.\"\n\n\"I was in really good shape. I lost a lot of weight. He said he wanted me like lean but strong. It's a weird thing,\" Damon told hosts Jason and Travis Kelce, referring to the film's director, Christopher Nolan.\n\nTo achieve that physique, Damon said he cut one thing out of his diet.\n\n\"I literally, just because of this other thing I did with my doctor, stopped eating gluten,\" Damon said. \"I used to walk around between 185 and 200. I did that whole movie at 167. And I haven't been that light since high school. So it was a lot of training and a really strict diet.\"\n\nThe actor said he works with a trainer, and compared the physical preparation to how the Kelce siblings would gear up for a football season, with training becoming part of his daily routine.\n\n\"You know, it's like just part of your day. It's part of your job, right? And it's like yeah, you get really routinized about it and really kind of build your day around all that stuff,\" Damon said.\n\nThe actor added that he hasn't had gluten since. \"I'm done. I'm done. I'm gluten-free everything,\" Damon said.\n\nA gluten-free diet eliminates gluten, a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. It is often adopted for medical or digestive reasons, including to manage symptoms of celiac disease.\n\nFor most people, gluten isn't necessarily harmful.\n\n\"Evidence suggests that, for general health, the emphasis should be on a whole, minimally processed, plant-based diet, which can include gluten-containing grains,\" Grace Fjeldberg, a registered dietician with the Mayo Clinic Health System, told Business Insider in 2021.\n\nDespite its popularity, a gluten-free diet doesn't necessarily result in weight loss and isn't a universal approach to better health.\n\nDamon is no stranger to getting into peak shape for a role.\n\nIn a 2016 BBC interview, Damon said that getting back into shape for his return to the Bourne franchise was \"brutal,\" after his last appearance in 2007's \"The Bourne Ultimatum.\"\n\n\"For the first Bourne movie I was 29 and I thought that was hard work getting into shape,\" Damon said.\n\n\"Now I'm 45 and it's just brutal. We shot this bare-knuckle fighting scene on my 45th birthday and it was a lot of work to get there,\" he added.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump abruptly changed his tone Wednesday about his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, saying they had exchanged a friendly phone call and he’d even invited the leader of the South American country to the White House.  “It was a Great Honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had,” Trump posted on his social media site.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump abruptly changed his tone Wednesday about his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, saying they had exchanged a friendly phone call and he’d even invited the leader of the South American country to the White House.\n\n“It was a Great Honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had,” Trump posted on his social media site. “I appreciated his call and tone, and look forward to meeting him in the near future.”\n\nHe wrote that the upcoming meeting would take place at the White House.\n\nThat came mere days after Trump said in the wake of the U.S. operation to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend that “Colombia is very sick too” and accused Petro of ”making cocaine and selling it to the United States.\"\n\nIn comments to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump added of Petro, “He’s not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you.” Asked whether U.S. intervention was possible, Trump responded, ”Sounds good to me.”\n\nLater Wednesday, addressing thousands of protesters that he had mobilized to rally against U.S. military threats, Petro said he had spoken with Trump for roughly one hour.\n\n“I talked about two things: Venezuela and the issue of drug trafficking,” he told the crowd in downtown Bogotá, where demonstrators had just minutes earlier chanted slogans against the United States at Petro’s behest.\n\nPetro explained to the audience that Colombian politicians allegedly linked to narco-trafficking misled the U.S. president about Petro’s record to turn Trump against him.\n\n“Those (people) are responsible for this crisis — let’s call it diplomatic for now, verbal for now — that has erupted between the U.S. and Colombia,” he said.\n\nTrump now suddenly warming to Petro is especially surprising since Colombia’s president called the U.S. operation in Venezuela an “abhorrent” violation of Latin American sovereignty. He also suggested it was committed by “enslavers” and constituted a “spectacle of death” comparable to Nazi Germany’s 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.\n\nColombia has long been among America’s staunchest Latin American allies, a pillar of Washington’s counternarcotics strategy abroad. For three decades, the U.S. has worked closely with Colombia, the world’s largest producer of cocaine, to arrest drug traffickers, fend off rebel groups and boost economic development in rural areas.\n\nStill, before Trump's conciliatory post, tensions had been rising between the U.S. and Colombia for months.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed sanctions in October on Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. Colombia is considered the epicenter of the world’s cocaine trade.\n\nTrump began his monthslong pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats launched from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to also target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific that came from Colombia.\n\nThe U.S. in September added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of U.S. assistance to the country.\n\n“He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories,\" Trump said of Petro on Sunday. \"He’s not going to be doing it.”\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Colombian president's name.",

    "fullText": "Grassy hills and boggy ditches are Megan Keith's happy place.\n\nFor most of her running life she has considered herself primarily a cross-country athlete but, after winning the European Under-23 title two years ago, a reality dawned on her: if she was to be a professional athlete, she would need to look beyond mud and brutal ascents.\n\n\"Pretty much until the end of secondary school, I didn't have any interest in the track. My entire running sphere revolved around cross country,\" Keith, 23, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But sponsors and British Athletics put their main focus on the track, so I've had to become a track runner and view cross country differently.\n\n\"It's where my passion still lies but there's expectations for me in the summer, so I can't put all my eggs into being in peak form in the winter.\"\n\nThe shift has proven fruitful. A European 10,000m bronze in the summer of 2024 preceded Olympic and World Championship appearances over the same distance, earning her British Athletics funding for the first time.\n\nBut the Inverness runner still makes time to follow her heart. She won European Cross Country individual and team silvers last month and will lead the British contingent at Saturday's World Cross Country Championships in Tallahassee, Florida, which you can watch on the BBC (14:35-19:00 GMT).\n\nCross country, though, is no longer the prestigious discipline it once was and the number taking part at the top level has fallen. About 500 participants will line up this weekend across the various races, compared to a high of more than 800 at the turn of the century. Previously an annual showpiece event, it was cut to biennial from 2011.\n\nMany nations do not send athletes to it, while others take skeleton teams, shorn of their leading lights, whose winter focus instead lies on training for lucrative spring road races or prominent summer track opportunities.\n\nSo, how did cross country get to this point and what does its future look like?",

    "fullText": "State residents worth more than $1bn could face one-off, 5% tax to help fund education, food assistance and healthcare\n\nA battle is brewing in California over a plan to tax billionaires – with tech titans divided over whether they should pay up, or flee the state.\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\n“We chose to live in Silicon Valley,” Huang said. “And whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with Google co-founder Larry Page, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they’re leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nThe tax proposal is being led by the labor union Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. If passed, the tax would retroactively apply to residents as of 1 January, and billionaires would have five years to pay it.\n\nThis means Huang would pay roughly $7bn and Page and Thiel would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $1.3bn, respectively, based on their current net worth.\n\n“What remains undeniable is the underlying unfairness of the current system,” Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for SEIU-UHW, said in an email. “Regular working people pay higher effective tax rates than the wealthiest Americans … Asking those who have benefited most from the economy to contribute more – particularly to stabilize health care systems under direct threat – is a reasonable step.”\n\nThe proposal is still in the beginning phases. Under California law, it needs to collect 874,641 signatures to qualify for the state ballot in November. It would also need to be signed by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who has said he opposes the wealth tax.\n\n“You can’t isolate yourself from the 49 others,” Newsom said when asked about wealth taxes during the New York Times DealBook Summit last month. “We’re in a competitive environment.”\n\nThis puts Newsom at odds with Ro Khanna, the California representative who represents Silicon Valley and who has championed the idea of a wealth tax. Khanna says tech billionaires will likely stay in the state, despite a tax, because California is where the larger industry, innovation and talent pool are located. “A billionaire tax is good for American innovation,” Khanna said, adding that it would spread the wealth to other sectors.\n\nWhen Thiel indicated he was leaving California because of the proposed tax, Khanna posted to X: “I echo what FDR said with sarcasm of economic royalists when they threatened to leave, ‘I will miss them very much.’”\n\nThis is not California’s first billionaire exodus. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, famously departed for Texas in 2020, which stood to save him millions in taxes. He has also shifted several of his companies’ headquarters there. Most recently, in 2024, Musk announced he was moving SpaceX to Texas because of a California law that aimed to protect transgender children in schools. He called the law a “final straw”.\n\nOther tech billionaires have also decamped to Texas, which has no state income tax. Citing a better tax environment, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale moved to Austin in 2020, and Larry Ellison transitioned Oracle’s headquarters there in 2020 (he has since said he’s moving the company to Nashville). Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, has long lived in Texas.\n\nSacks made his announcement on 31 December, posting an image of the Texas flag on X and saying: “God bless Texas.” In a separate post the following day, Sacks wrote: “As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.”\n\nMusk, Lonsdale and Dell all responded with hearty welcomes. “No one will fight harder for the independent and free spirit of Texas than people who know [sic] it’s like when that’s taken away,” Musk wrote.\n\nPage has not publicly said where he’s moving, but in December companies associated with the Google co-founder filed documents to incorporate in Florida, according to the New York Times. Thiel, who owns a home in the Hollywood Hills, also seems to have set his sights on Florida. His investment firm, Thiel Capital, announced on 31 December that it had opened an office in Miami. The firm said Thiel has maintained a personal residence in the city since 2020.\n\nOn X, tech investors and other billionaires have blasted the proposed wealth tax. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook executive, said that without billionaires, California’s “budget deficit will only get bigger”, and Vinod Khosla, another investor, said that under the proposed tax, “California will lose its most important taxpayers and net off much worse”.\n\nSome have indicated they’d work to oust Khanna from Congress. Martin Casado, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote that Khanna had “devolved into an obnoxious jerk” and that his support of the wealth tax had alienated him from moderates. In response, Garry Tan, the CEO of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote: “Time to primary him.”\n\nThe SEIU’s Jimenez said states like Massachusetts and Washington, which have other forms of wealth taxes, have seen billions of dollars raised to help the state. At the same time, she said, high-income residents have continued to see their portfolios grow. Jimenez added that the union is “heartened” by Huang’s recent comments and is hopeful that more billionaires will follow suit.\n\nAs for Huang, he said Nvidia is in Silicon Valley because that’s where the engineers are and he’s not worried about a billionaire tax.\n\n“Not this person,” Huang said. “This person is trying to build the future of AI.”\n\nRepresentatives for Page, Thiel, Sacks and Newsom did not return requests for comment.",

IWF analysts said the images would be considered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under UK law.\n\n“We can confirm our analysts have discovered criminal imagery of children aged between 11 and 13 which appears to have been created using the tool,” said Ngaire Alexander, the head of the IWF’s hotline, which investigates reports of CSAM from members of the public.\n\nX, Elon Musk’s social media platform, has been deluged with images of women and children whose clothes have been digitally removed by the Grok tool, sparking public outcry and condemnation from politicians.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, the House of Commons women and equalities committee said it would no longer use X for its communications, saying it was no longer appropriate to do so given preventing violence against women and girls was among its key policy areas.\n\nThe decision marks the first significant move by a Westminster organisation to exit X in response to the misuse of Grok. While the decision concerned only the committee’s account, some individual members, including the Labour chair, Sarah Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.\n\nAlexander said the imagery viewed by the IWF has been used to create even more extreme material – known as Category A, which includes penetrative sexual activity – using a different AI tool.\n\n“We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material. Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream. That is unacceptable,” Alexander added.\n\nMusk’s xAI, which owns Grok and X, has been approached for comment.\n\nDowning Street said “all options were on the table”, including a boycott of X as ministers backed the UK regulator, Ofcom, to take action.\n\nOn Wednesday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “X needs to deal with this urgently and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users.\n\n“It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law.”\n\nRequests for Grok to manipulate images of women to “put her in a bikini” continued to flood in on X on Wednesday. Despite the warnings of EU and UK regulatory action, there was no evidence that the platform had installed tighter safeguards, and pictures of teenage girls continue to be stripped down digitally at the request of X users, to show them in small, revealing items of underwear, or positioned in sexually explicit poses.\n\nSome users have demanded more extreme content, asking the chatbot to decorate bikinis with swastikas, or requesting alterations to photographs of women so they appear to be victims of abuse. The chatbot has obliged by adding cigarette burns, facial bruising, and blood to some images of women.\n\nThe UK’s data watchdog – the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) – said it had contacted X and xAI “to seek clarity on the measures they have in place to comply with UK data protection law and protect individuals’ rights”, adding people have “a right to use social media knowing their personal data is being handled lawfully and with respect”.\n\nX has said it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, “by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary”.",

    "fullText": "PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, Xbox, PC; Square-Enix\nThis landmark role-playing game remains a revolutionary tour de force\n\nAt first glance, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, first released in 1997 and now available in newly remastered guise, does little to separate itself from other boilerplate fantasy fiction. There is a hero, Ramza – an idealistic nobleman with luscious blond hair who cavorts about the medieval-inspired realm of Ivalice in search of high adventure. But quickly, and with narrative elegance, the picture complicates: peasant revolutionaries duke it out with gilded monarchists; machiavellian plots plunge the kingdom into chaos. Ramza must navigate this knotty political matrix, all while experiencing his own ideological awakening.\n\nThere is a strong case to be made that Final Fantasy Tactics tells a better story than the landmark Final Fantasy VII (which saw Cloud Strife and a ragtag bunch of eco-terrorist pals taking on the shady megacorporation Shinra). And with our real-world political focus shifting from the looming threat of the climate crisis to the more pressing rise of fascism (though the two are inextricably linked), one can make the argument that Tactics is now also the more timely game.\n\nIn this remastered version, the plot still sparkles. Shakespearean dialogue is now fully voice-acted with delightfully hammy performances: you can practically feel the spittle on your face as one of the game’s royalist rotters delivers an incandescent tirade against the common folk.\n\nWithin this terrific political tapestry, you engage in the real meat of the game: turn-based combat of rare malleability. Each of your party – Ramza, lowborn Delita, and many more – has their own “job” (essentially, a character class), and these can be changed and subsequently remixed with few limitations (want to create a gun-toting mage? No problem!). This level of customisation, coupled with the exquisite diorama levels where the skirmishes take place, results in a symphonic take on chess.\n\nThese battles aren’t just riotous fun; they are also poetic. “I’ve been dealt a hand. I simply play it,” says one foe during a dramatic showdown at a cascading waterfall. The line speaks to the tragedy that gradually surfaces as you play through these square-gridded encounters – the sense that every character has been thrust into a maelstrom of events bigger than themselves. Heroes, villains, and everyone in between are but pawns on the battlefield, hurtling towards their own prefigured date with destiny.\n\nThe Ivalice Chronicles is not interested in narrative flexibility; its plot does not bend to the whims of the player like other RPGs. The story’s framing – recounted as a historical account in the distant future – makes this abundantly clear. As such, the game is less about fantasy and fairytales than history itself. Forget easy resolutions: here, events simply produce yet more events; trauma begets trauma. It is one battle after another for Ramza and his comrades.\n\nThis might sound doom-laden, and, in truth, it frequently is. Yet there is no mistaking the moral principles that suffuse writer Yasumi Matsuno’s stirring story of inequality, division, and pig-headed elites who seek to consolidate their already mighty power. Matsuno, who studied foreign policy before becoming an economic reporter, has described Final Fantasy Tactics as a work of “class struggle”. Now, in the time of No Kings protests in the US, the erosion of political rights in the UK, and the further enriching of the world’s hyperwealthy, the game feels even more resonant.\n\nRamza offers a model for resistance, and also a commentary on the struggle of opposition in such turbulent times. He is principled, uncompromising and always seeks to do right – and his reward is to be deemed a heretic by the most powerful institutions of his time.",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox have made some good moves this offseason, trading for Sonny Gray, Johan Oviedo and Willson Contreras. They’ve improved their rotation and upgraded at first base, especially defensively.\n\nWhat they haven’t done yet, however, is sign a Major League free agent two months into the offseason. After the Colorado Rockies signed veteran pitcher Michael Lorenzen to a one-year deal on Wednesday night, the Red Sox are now the only team that still hasn’t signed an MLB free agent this winter.\n\nGiven the team’s high payroll, goals and publicly expressed needs, that’s pretty shocking.\n\nIt’s not for a lack of trying. Boston made an offer to Pete Alonso before he signed with the Baltimore Orioles and has also made an “aggressive” offer to Alex Bregman. Time will tell if Bregman re-signs with the Red Sox, but there’s a good chance that he does.\n\nThe Red Sox are officially the only MLB club that has yet to sign a big-league free agent this offseason 😬 pic.twitter.com/c3ePQSL52Z\n\n— NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSBoston) January 8, 2026\n\nThose are big moves, however, and big moves don’t usually happen overnight. It’s more surprising that Boston hasn’t at least done a one-year deal for a reliever or depth player, who are much more plentiful and easier to sign.\n\nSpring Training is five weeks away, so there’s still time. Craig Breslow has a reputation for being patient and deliberate, and he hasn’t proven to be the kind of executive who recklessly throws money around. He has a plan, and he sticks to it.\n\nThe Red Sox have managed to make several good additions so far without spending any money in free agency. If they want someone like Bregman or Bo Bichette, however, that will have to change.\n\nYankees Predicted To Sign Former NL MVP While Red Sox Eye Different Free Agent",

    "fullText": "Well Mark Bowman wrote a good article on the status of the Braves’ search for starting pitching to add this offseason. It was interesting that he seemed to think that non-qualifying offer free agents or perhaps select non-top-tier trade options are the more likely avenues. Freddy Peralta is a hot commodity and has been covered a decent bit, but Jose Berrios is an off-the-beaten-path option that might be up Alex Anthopoulos’ alley and has an interesting profile. Berrios has struggled since joining Toronto, but was previously a reliable mid-rotation option in Minnesota. He has one year left on his contract at $19 million, with an opt-out before 2 years at $24 million each. That opt-out is surely something that Alex Anthopoulos would want to resolve somehow in a trade scenario before finalizing any deal. That said, Berrios would seem highly unlikely to require much trade capital to acquire, which might make him an appealing buy-low candidate at still only 31. Time will tell which route Anthopoulos chooses.\n\nMark Bowman wrote about Atlanta’s pursuit of a starting pitcher, throwing cold water on some of the top free agents, while promoting Chris Bassitt and Freddy Peralta as more likely options and Jose Berrios as a wild-card.\n\nThe Braves are once again experiencing some uncertainty regarding their TV deal. They could find themselves on a different channel or platform, or suffer loss of revenue.\n\nIvan took a look at what we should expect from Ozzie Albies this season, as he has been heavily diminished from his peak over the last two years.\n\nThe Rockies signed Michael Lorenzen to a one year $8 million deal, with a $9 million club option to be a starting pitcher for the club.\n\nThe Cubs traded top prospect Owen Caissie and two other prospects for Edward Cabrera from the Marlins, perhaps the most significant trade of the offseason as of yet.\n\nThe Yankees have made multiple offers for Cody Bellinger to return to the club, but the sides do not appear close to an agreement.",

    "fullText": "Josh Jacobs doesn’t hide how Packers felt about Jordan Love hit ahead of Bears rematch originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears don’t need much help turning a game into something emotional. History alone usually takes care of that. Add in playoff stakes, a division rivalry and a quarterback who didn’t make it out of the last meeting unscathed, and the temperature rises naturally.\n\nSaturday’s wild-card matchup has all the familiar ingredients. Green Bay and Chicago split their regular-season meetings, and the third installment comes with far more at stake than bragging rights. For the Bears, it’s a chance to make a statement at home. For the Packers, it’s about survival — and reminding a longtime rival that the road still runs through them.\n\nThose dynamics have lingered all week, but the tone sharpened once the conversation turned back to Week 16.\n\nThat’s when Packers quarterback Jordan Love took a hit in Chicago that resulted in a concussion and forced him to miss the following week’s loss to the Baltimore Ravens. While the Packers moved forward, the moment didn’t disappear inside the locker room.\n\nRunning back Josh Jacobs made that clear when speaking with reporters this week.\n\n“I know a lot of guys took that hit that he took a little personal,” Jacobs said, per The Athletic's Matt Schneidman. “So I’m not saying we gon’ go out there and play dirty or nothing like that, but we definitely gonna defend our brother.”\n\nJacobs stopped short of framing it as payback, and he was careful with his wording. But the message itself didn’t need translation. Green Bay hasn’t forgotten what happened, even as it insists discipline and control will matter most in a playoff setting.\n\nThat balance — emotion without recklessness — has defined much of the Packers’ season. Green Bay has lived on the edge at times, especially late, but it has also leaned on its leaders to keep things from spiraling. Jacobs has become one of those voices, both on the field and in the locker room.\n\nHis comments weren’t a promise of cheap shots or retaliation. They were a reminder that this is still a physical sport, and that quarterbacks don’t get left unprotected — especially in January.\n\nWhether the matchup turns chippy or simply physical remains to be seen. But Jacobs’ words made one thing clear: for the Packers, this isn’t just another playoff game. It’s personal — even if they insist it won’t cross the line.",

    "description": "Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks spoke about his former team, the Memphis Grizzlies, and what he sees from them now.",
    "fullText": "Dillon Brooks returned to Memphis on Jan. 7 for his latest matchup against the Grizzlies, his former team.\n\nThis was his first time playing against them as a member of the Phoenix Suns, and he looked motivated. He led the team with 21 points in the 117-98 win at FedExForum.\n\nAfter the game, Brooks reflected on his time in Memphis, where he played from 2017 to 2023. The Grizzlies were the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference in each of his final two seasons, but they elected to move on from him.\n\nThey have yet to reach those heights again, and Brooks has an opinion on why that’s the case.\n\n“I just think they moved too fast,” he said. “Especially when I was there and Des (Bane) was there and (Steven Adams) was there. I think (the Grizzlies) moved too fast, trying to be (inventive) too fast and it kind of bit them in the butt a little bit.”\n\nThe Grizzlies parted ways with Brooks during the 2023 offseason. They missed the playoffs during an injury-riddled 2024 season, then were swept in the first round of the 2025 playoffs by the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nSince leaving Memphis, Brooks has made many notable comments. Among them was when he called out Grizzlies general manager Zach Kleiman for hurting his confidence during the 2023 playoffs.\n\nIn 2023, Brooks also talked about how he didn’t have plays run for him to help find a rhythm. After the Suns' win, he said he still doesn’t get plays run for him, but he has worked on his game, and he credited the belief the Suns' coaches, players and organization have put in him.\n\n“You got to be willing to have communication, have trust in the players, and they play hard for you,” Brooks said. “I think that’s not what I see over there (in Memphis) now.”\n\nDamichael Cole is the Memphis Grizzlies beat writer for The Commercial Appeal.

    "fullText": "Tyler Herro gets honest about the 'young and fun' Miami Heat this season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a long while with many veterans on the team, the Miami Heat have embraced a younger squad this season. Head coach Erik Spoelstra has implemented a run-and-gun system this season, which has been quite helpful to players like Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Pelle Larsson.\n\nTyler Herro and Bam Adebayo were once the youngsters of the Heat roster, but now, they are considered the veterans. They are excited about playing for the Heat as the reliable veterans and leaders of this mostly young squad.\n\nThe current Heat rotation is filled to the brim with talented youngsters. Names like Jaquez, Larsson, and Nikola Jovic are some of the most promising players on the roster. They fit Spoelstra's new vision of working hard and playing hard at a fast pace.\n\nFor Herro and Adebayo, this can be jarring, especially since they played in a Jimmy Butler-centric system. Now that Butler is with the Golden State Warriors, Spoelstra and his system have become much more fast-paced.\n\nMore: Heat's Tyler Herro made NBA 3-point history 1 game faster than Steph Curry\n\nHerro is glad and happy to play in this current iteration of the Heat. It has been a rough season for him because he missed plenty of games with an injury. Now that he has returned, the team is ecstatic about his comeback, while he is playing with more youthful players.\n\n\"This team, we're young and fun. We got energy, being on the sideline, that’s one thing I noticed since this season started. I've seen the game through a different lens than on the court. Everyone is coachable and understanding of each other so far. It’s like everyone is for each other this year; that goes a long way,\" Herro said in response to a question about the current roster.\n\nMoving forward, the Heat have a promising future with the current squad. It will be a challenging stretch, but in the long run, they could keep developing into a better team. With a good mix of experience and youth, Spoelstra has a strong team that could be even better in the long-term future.\n\nErik Spoelstra expresses disappointment in the Miami Heat's lack of effort\n\nBam Adebayo ties second all-time for field goals made in Heat history\n\nNorman Powell continues his All-Star campaign this season 'Hopefully it happens for me'\n\nMiami's top defender Davion Mitchell seen as a huge threat to Anthony Edwards\n\nNBA trade rumors: Ranking 9 most likely stars to be traded, from Giannis Antetokounmpo to Anthony Davis",

    "fullText": "CJ McCollum reacts to being traded to Atlanta Hawks for Trae Young originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCJ McCollum’s brief tenure with the Washington Wizards has come to an end.\n\nThe veteran guard was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, along with Corey Kispert, for star guard Trae Young. The Hawks will be McCollum’s fourth team in the league following stints with the Portland Trail Blazers, New Orleans Pelicans and Wizards.\n\nMcCollum was traded from New Orleans to Washington during the 2025 NBA Draft. In all, he appeared in 35 games for Washington and posted averages of 18.8 points, 3.6 assists and 3.5 rebounds in 30.9 minutes per performance.\n\nAfter news of the trade broke, McCollum, 34, reacted to the deal by expressing gratitude for his time in D.C. and excitement about his future in Atlanta.\n\n“Loved my time in DC,” McCollum said, via NBA insider Chris Haynes. “Organization was great to my family and I. Michael Winger and Will [Dawkins] did everything they said they would and kept their word from the very beginning. Love the city and they’re doing things the right way over there.\n\n\"Exited to get to The A and get to work. Very familiar with their style of play. Love the ownership group and front office. Good group of players.”\n\nIt certainly doesn’t sound like McCollum harbors any ill will towards the Wizards organization for trading him, but if he does, he won’t have to wait too long to exact some revenge. The Hawks will host the Wizards for back-to-back games on Feb. 24 and 26.\n\nUltimately, McCollum's stay in Atlanta, like his stay in Washington, could be a short one. He's headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and there's no guarantee that he'll be back in Atlanta. But, if he proves to be a valuable addition to the Hawks this season, he'll boost his own stock in the process.",

Arizona won by at least 18 points for the 10th consecutive game, matching a mark Michigan had earlier this season that tied for the longest such run since 2003-04.\n\nBurries had his fifth 20-point game and matched his career high by going 12 for 16 from the field while adding nine rebounds. Krivas was 7 of 10, making 11 of 13 free throws, and had 12 rebounds.\n\nKoa Peat had 15 points and 10 rebounds and Tobe Awaka added nine and 11 as Arizona outrebounded Kansas State 55-32. Arizona shot 49.3% from the field but was just 3 of 16 from 3-point range.\n\nKansas State (9-6, 0-2) went 8 for 36 from deep and shot 33.8% overall.

They didn’t lead until Jefferson’s 3-pointer on their final shot before halftime, and stayed ahead after a 14-1 run to begin the second half when six players scored and Jefferson capped it with a fast-break dunk.\n\nIowa State’s 15-0 start and 15-game winning streak are both school records, surpassing the 14-0 start by the 2013-14 team that reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nCameron Carr had 17 points to lead Baylor (10-4, 0-2). James Nnaji, the 2023 NBA draft pick who just joined the Bears, got a much different reaction in his home debut when scoring two points with five rebounds in 16 minutes. He was booed when he entered Saturday’s game at TCU and every time he touched the ball after that.\n\nNO. 4 UCONN 103, PROVIDENCE 98, OT\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Braylon Mullins scored eight of his career-high 24 points in overtime and UConn rallied past Providence for its 11th consecutive victory.\n\nSilas Demary Jr. had 23 points, 15 assists and five steals for the Huskies (15-1, 5-0 Big East), who trailed by 11 with under three minutes remaining in regulation. But they went on a 9-0 run and then tied it at 89 on a putback by Tarris Reed Jr. with 13 seconds left.\n\nAlex Karaban also scored 23 for UConn, which shot 18 of 32 from 3-point range (56%).\n\nMullins, a freshman guard, scored the first five Huskies points in overtime before his sixth 3-pointer made it a two-possession game with less than two minutes to play.

(AP) — Braden Smith finished with 23 points and seven assists and made two late free throws to help Purdue fend off Washington’s late rally.\n\nTrey Kaufman-Renn added 14 points and 14 rebounds as the Boilermakers won their fifth in a row and matched a school-best start at 14-1 (4-0 Big Ten) for the ninth time in program history.\n\nIt came on a night Purdue honored Smith, an Associated Press preseason All-American guard, before the national anthem by presenting the Big Ten’s new career assists leader with a framed poster. Smith broke the record Friday at Wisconsin and pushed his career total to 900 on Wednesday.\n\nYet, it was an odd night for Smith, who went 10 of 15 from the field with only one 3-pointer while committing six turnovers and spending nearly 8 1/2 consecutive minutes on the bench after drawing his third foul with 4:20 left in the first half.\n\nHannes Steinbach had 17 points to lead the Huskies (9-6, 1-3).

This is only the second time in the program’s 124-year history that Vanderbilt has won its first 15.\n\nVanderbilt hadn’t played a ranked opponent until this game, also the first here between two top-15 teams since Jan. 5, 1974. Then-No. 10 Vanderbilt beat the 14th-ranked Crimson Tide in that game on its way to splitting the SEC championship with Alabama.\n\nVanderbilt also beat Alabama for the first time at Memorial Gym since 2018, ending a five-game skid against the Tide.\n\nDuke Miles finished with 19 points before fouling out, and four other Commodores had four fouls apiece. Tyler Nickel scored 12 points. Devin McGlockton and AK Okereke, who also fouled out, each added 10.\n\nAlabama (11-4, 1-1) had its four-game winning streak snapped in a game featuring 63 combined fouls, with two technicals on the Crimson Tide.\n\nAmari Allen led Alabama with a season-high 25 points. Leading scorer Labaron Philon Jr. added 18 but checked out with 16:06 to go and never returned. Aden Holloway had 22 points and Latrell Wrightsell Jr. scored 13.\n\nNO. 15 ARKANSAS 94, MISSISSIPPI 87\n\nOXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Darius Acuff, Jr. had 26 points and nine assists, and Arkansas got double-figure scoring from five players in a win over Mississippi.\n\nArkansas (12-3, 2-0 SEC) used a decisive 14-6 run midway through the second half to build an insurmountable 76-61 lead. The win snapped a three-game losing streak to Ole Miss (8-7, 0-2).\n\nThe Rebels pulled within 91-87 in the final minute, but Acuff converted a short jumper and Trevon Brazile added a free throw to help seal the win. Arkansas finished 22 of 30 (73%) from the free throw line, including 11 of 12 by Acuff.\n\nBrazile scored 18 points, Billy Richmond III and Meleek Thomas added 13 points apiece, and Karter Knox scored 10 in the balanced Arkansas performance.\n\nOle Miss was led by Ilias Kamardine and Malik Dia with 16 points apiece. AJ Storr scored 12 points, Eduardo Klafke had 11 in the second half and Patton Pinkins added 10.\n\nNO. 23 VIRGINIA 84, CALIFORNIA 60\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Malik Thomas scored 20 points and Virginia beat California in its Atlantic Coast Conference home openert, scoring at least 80 points for the 14th time in 15 games this season.\n\nJohann Grunloh, Thijs De Ridder, Sam Lewis and Ugonna Onyenso each added 12 for the Cavaliers (13-2, 2-1), who assisted on 23 of 30 baskets and dominated the glass with 45-26 edge in rebounding.\n\nVirginia has won two straight since a triple-overtime loss at rival Virginia Tech on New Year’s Eve.\n\nFormer Virginia guard Dai Dai Ames, who transferred to Cal after last year and is the team’s leading scorer this season, had 18 points for the Golden Bears (13-3, 1-2).\n\nJustin Pippen, son of NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen, added 17 points and Virginia Tech transfer John Camden finished with 15.\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) — RJ Godfrey scored 17 points and Clemson held down SMU.\n\nThe Tigers (13-3) have started 3-0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference for a second consecutive season. And they did it by corralling one of the highest-scoring teams in the country most of the way.\n\nSMU (12-3, 1-1) came in averaging 91.5 points per game — tops in the ACC and 14th nationally — but couldn’t crack Clemson’s defense until late in the game.\n\nThe Mustangs cut a 15-point deficit to 71-67 on Boopie Miller’s free throws with 1:23 left. SMU had a chance to get closer, but Miller missed a short jumper. Jake Wahlin got the rebound for Clemson and made a foul shot with 22.5 seconds to play.\n\nMoments later, Dillon Hunter hit two foul shots to extend the lead to 74-67 with less than 10 seconds remaining.\n\nMiller led all scorers with 23 points. Samet Yigitoglu had 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Mustangs.",

    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders are coming off a hugely disappointing 5-12 season, one season after a shocking 12-5 year and a run to the NFC Championship Game. In response to such a disastrous season, head coach Dan Quinn is making changes — big changes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Quinn and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury mutually agreed to part ways. Judging by Quinn's inability to endorse Kingsbury over the last two weeks, it wasn't shocking despite the good work Kingsbury has done with the Commanders' offense, even despite the injuries. Right after the Kingsbury news, the Commanders also fired defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. and offensive line coach Bobby Johnson.\n\nQuinn took over as defensive play-caller before Washington's Week 11 game against Miami. It doesn't sound like that will continue, as Quinn wants to focus on being the head coach. So, who could replace Whitt as defensive coordinator?\n\nWe named 10 potential candidates to be the Commanders' next offensive coordinator. Now, here are 10 defensive coordinator candidates.\n\nEmbedded content: https://commanderswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/commanders/2026/01/06/washington-commanders-10-names-watch-kingsbury-oc/88056493007/\n\nJeff Ulbrich may be the leader in the clubhouse. He's still under contract with the Falcons, but that could change soon. Ulbrich and Quinn go back to when Quinn was a 49ers assistant, and Ulbrich was a linebacker. Ulbrich began his coaching career with the Seahawks when Quinn was an assistant there. He would serve under Quinn during his entire six seasons with the Falcons. From there, he went to the Jets, where he served as a successful defensive coordinator for 4 years. Keep an eye on this one.\n\nMorris and Dan Quinn are close. They've known one another for over 20 years, dating back to when Quinn was a young assistant at Hofstra when Morris played there. When Quinn was the Falcons' head coach, Morris was on his staff for 6 seasons. Morris has been a successful defensive coordinator with the Rams and a two-time head coach. It sounds like he will first focus on head-coaching interviews before considering any defensive coordinator positions.\n\nAnother potential favorite. Harris once said he'd follow Dan Quinn anywhere while they were both with the Cowboys. He tried to bring him to Washington, but the Cowboys blocked it. Harris landed with the Bears this season, and they turn the ball over better than anyone in the NFL. Chicago doesn't have the best defense, but they are ballhawks. Harris has been an integral part of that success, much like he was in Dallas under Quinn. The Cowboys forced turnovers better than anyone during Quinn and Harris's tenure from 2021-23. Does Quinn want to go with another first-time play-caller? That's the biggest question here. Otherwise, Harris would be a phenomenal hire.\n\nA veteran coach who has been a successful defensive coordinator with four different teams and a former head coach. He and Quinn come from the same Pete Carroll coaching tree. Quinn worked on the Seattle staff with Bradley for two years. This hire would not energize fans. Bradley's defenses with the Colts tailed off. Many would consider this an uninspiring hire at this point.\n\nJonathan Gannon is now free. He will land somewhere and quickly. He was terrific as the Eagles' defensive coordinator for two seasons. Gannon is a creative coach. He has no ties to Quinn and would bring fresh ideas to a staff in dire need of them. Gannon will be at the top of a few lists this offseason.\n\nA pipedream. Flores is a coaching free agent. He can go anywhere. However, he plans to interview for head coaching positions but could return to Minnesota if he doesn't land one. It would be hard for Washington to land Flores. Flores could essentially pick anywhere he wants to go. There are rumors that he could land in Las Vegas as head coach. We shall see. However, Kevin O'Connell will fight to keep him. Flores is the NFL's best defensive coordinator. One of the league's best defensive schemers.\n\nAlong with Flores, this is a dream candidate. The Browns won five games because of Schwartz's defense. A Maryland native and Georgetown University graduate, he once interviewed for Washington's head coaching position. A former Lions head coach, Schwartz has built top defenses across the NFL. The Browns are interviewing him for the head coaching vacancy. Another coach with no ties to Quinn, so don't look for this one to happen either.\n\nThe former NFL linebacker has also enjoyed a successful coaching career. He has worked with Quinn before and has been the Commanders LB coach since 2024. A two-time defensive coordinator with the Seahawks and Raiders, Norton is a long shot. But he has experience calling plays, so you can't rule him out.\n\nThe first name on the list. The Commanders asked the Raiders for permission to interview Graham on Wednesday. A Yale graduate, Graham has been the Raiders' defensive coordinator since 2022, surviving multiple head coaches. Before that, he was the Giants' defensive coordinator. Graham hasn't always had a lot to work with, so he's creative and loves to blitz. You want a guy who has done more with less? Graham qualifies.\n\nCory Undlin is the underdog. He's been an NFL assistant for 22 years and had only one stint as a defensive coordinator: with the Detroit Lions in 2020. That team was terrible, and Undlin didn't have a real shot. From there, he went to San Francisco, worked under Kyle Shanahan for two years before following DeMeco Ryans to Houston. The Texans have one of the NFL's top defenses, and Undlin is very involved. He deserves another shot. GM Adam Peters was in San Francisco for both of Undlin's years there, so there is familiarity.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: 10 potential defensive coordinator candidates",

    "fullText": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander rescued the Oklahoma City Thunder with a game-tying buzzer-beater before finishing with 46 points in a 129-125 overtime victory against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.\n\nThe reigning NBA champions looked to be heading for a third straight loss after the Jazz inched into a 114-112 lead following Lauri Markkanen's layup with just three seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut NBA Most Valuable Player Gilgeous-Alexander drained a superb 13-foot jump shot to tie it up at 114-114 as the buzzer sounded to send the game into overtime.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander then took over in the extra period with nine points as the Western Conference leaders returned to winning ways after back-to-back defeats.\n\n\"We just tried to stay in the moment and do whatever it took to get the W,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said afterwards.\n\n\"It's not always going to be pretty, but we've got to play a lot better... we'd rather learn lessons in a win than in a loss.\"\n\nAsked about his game-tying buzzer-beater, Gilgeous-Alexander added: \"That's what I practice for. I work out for the moments when the game is at its tightest and you need plays.\"\n\nGilgeous-Alexander, who also had six rebounds and six assists, was backed with 23 points from Chet Holmgren, who pulled down 12 rebounds.\n\nOklahoma City improved to 31-7 at the top of the Western Conference.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs took full advantage of the absence of LeBron James to secure a 107-91 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nVictor Wembanyama scored 16 points from the bench while Keldon Johnson led the Spurs scorers with 27 points as San Antonio improved to 26-11. Luka Doncic led the Lakers with a game-high 38 points.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets improved to 25-12 after powering past the in-form Boston Celtics on the road.\n\nThe Celtics went into the game at the TD Garden as one of the form teams of the league after eight wins from their previous nine games saw them move into third place in the Eastern Conference.\n\nHowever Denver, playing without the injured Nikola Jokic, unleashed a barrage of 20 three-pointers to grab an impressive victory.\n\nPeyton Watson scored 30 points with six three-pointers while Jamal Murray finished with 22 points, eight rebounds and 17 assists. Jaylen Brown led the Boston scoring with 33 points.\n\nAt the top of the Eastern Conference, the Detroit Pistons moved to 28-9 after a 108-93 defeat of the Chicago Bulls thanks to a 31-point performance from Isaiah Stewart.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Joel Embiid's 28 points helped the 76ers trounce the Washington Wizards 131-110.\n\nThe New York Knicks ended their four-game losing streak with a 123-111 win over the struggling Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nJalen Brunson scored 26 points while Karl-Anthony Towns added 20 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists.\n\n\"For the most part, we played a little desperate tonight,\" Brunson said.\n\n\"We needed a win. The way we competed, the way we played, even if we were down in the first half, was Knicks basketball.\n\n\"We just kept playing that way and found a way to win.\"\n\nIn Memphis, former Grizzlies star Dillon Brooks returned to haunt his former club with 21 points for the Phoenix Suns in a 117-98 rout.",

    "fullText": "The post-Ruben Amorim era showed flashes of promise, but eventually, Manchester United had to be satisfied with only a point from their Premier League encounter against Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nUnder the lights at Turf Moor, it was the home side who took the lead through a lucky deflection, against the run of play.\n\nThe visitors should have scored twice before half-time, but Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha were denied by goalline clearances.\n\nBut then, in the second half, it was the Benjamin Sesko show, as the Slovenian scored twice in 10 minutes to hand the Red Devils the lead.\n\nThe Clarets ended up equalising, but fans were pleased to finally see the Slovenia international return to scoring ways after a difficult last few weeks.\n\nDuring the post-match interaction with BBC, the ex-RB Leipzig striker stated as much, while revealing his delight to end his drought in front of goal.\n\n“It helps me for my confidence,” the striker said. “It’s been tough, but now I finally did it and I’m happy I could help the team.\n\n“This is the most important for me and now it’s just up to me and up to us to keep going like that.”\n\nThere were improvements, both individually, as seen from Sesko and Dorgu’s performance, and as a team, especially from an attacking perspective.\n\nIt was helped by interim boss Darren Fletcher’s brave substitutions. And the United striker told Sky Sports that it is now up to the team to continue this positive momentum moving forward.\n\n“Now it’s up to us. Obviously, to stand together as a group, to really show we can work together no matter what situation.\n\n“In the end, it’s just important for us to focus on the upcoming games, upcoming trainings. That’s the most important.”\n\nUnited will seen next in action in the FA Cup, with a home tie against Brighton on Sunday. Fletcher is expected to remain in charge for the game.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby underwent what he termed successful left knee surgery Wednesday.\n\nCrosby posted a photo of himself on X flexing his arms while lying in a hospital bed. He had a brace on his knee.\n\n“Expecting 200% recovery,” Crosby wrote. “Year 8 Will Be The Greatest Year Yet.”\n\nCrosby didn't say where the surgery took place, but he said on the “Let's Go” podcast with Jim Gray that he was planning to fly to Los Angeles on Monday to meet with orthopedic surgeon Dr. Neal ElAttrache.\n\nCrosby hurt his knee at mid-season and played through the injury, but was placed on injured reserve with two games left. Crosby left the Raiders' facility upset after that decision, but returned the following week.\n\nHe had 10 sacks and a career-high 28 tackles for loss this season. Crosby has double-digit sacks three of the past four seasons.\n\nCrosby signed a three-year extension worth $106.5 million, with $91.5 million guaranteed, on March 5 that briefly made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. The deal takes Crosby through the 2029 season.\n\nRaiders general manager John Spytek was asked this week about Crosby's future with the organization.\n\n“I’ve had the opportunity in the last several weeks to spend a lot of time with Maxx, and I think it’s been well documented that he didn’t love the idea of not playing football,” Spytek said. “I think you always want that from your best players. In fact, I think that’s why they’re your best players. So, I love Maxx. He embodies what a Raider is.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "The Chicago Blackhawks defeated the St. Louis Blues, their fourth straight win.",
    "fullText": "CHICAGO - The Chicago Blackhawks came into Wednesday night's matchup winners of three straight games. They were looking to make it four with the St. Louis Blues in town.\n\nWith Connor Bedard and Frank Nazar out of the lineup, the Hawks needed the rest of their forwards to continue stepping up in their place. They have been doing just that since the holiday break ended, which has gotten them right back in the Western Conference race.\n\nThings started poorly for Chicago, as they allowed a goal to Tyler Tucker of the Blues less than one minute into the game. It's not easy to play well from behind that early, but they found a way.\n\nWhile on the man-advantage with the second unit out there, Nick Lardis blasted a beautiful pass from Oliver Moore past Jordan Binnington to tie the game at 1. That would be the end of the scoring for either team in the first period.\n\nIn the second, things took a dramatic turn in favor of Chicago. Oliver Moore and Otto Stenberg exchanged goals less than one minute apart for the 2-2 tie, but the Blackhawks took over from there.\n\nBefore the middle frame was over, the Blackhawks were winning 5-2 thanks to three consecutive goals by Connor Murphy, Landon Slaggert, and Jason Dickinson.\n\nThe Blackhawks kept their momentum going in the third period. Andre Burakovsky made it 6-2 with a snipe while the Blackhawks were working with a 5-on-3 advantage. That made them 3 for 3 on the power play for the evening.\n\nThe Blackhawks were not done there. Louis Crevier scored by cleaning up a rebound to make it 7-2. Less than one minute later, however, the Blues got one back in the form of Nathan Walker.\n\nThat 7-3 score stood as the final. It was once again a strange game between these two franchises. Every game this year has been so far, one way or another.\n\nSpencer Knight played extremely well for the Blackhawks in goal. He allowed three goals by the end of the game, but he made some point-blank saves on high-danger Blues chances while the game was still up for grabs.\n\nanother goal for the kid✅ pic.twitter.com/95L64uf9Bl\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\nmore goals 🔜😏 pic.twitter.com/MHHAks0n5L\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\nMurph's first of the season!👏👇 pic.twitter.com/KJGdwOCmiP\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\nadmin stands corrected, Landon Slaggert tipped in this goal!👏 https://t.co/jGotVsXB3F pic.twitter.com/4IUhAGKr8K\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\ncould we add Chelsea Dagger to the queue one more time pls🎶 pic.twitter.com/ebGyERyT6g\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\nAndre Burakovsky on the power play🔥 pic.twitter.com/gDzTmNBLko\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\ntouchdown + the extra point🙌 pic.twitter.com/WsIrhwrxDB\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\nWhat’s Next For The Blackhawks?\n\nThe Blackhawks are back in action on Friday night at the United Center.

    "fullText": "A few weeks into the season, Everton’s chief marketing and digital officer, Aaron Duckmanton, received an email from a colleague with links to YouTube and TikTok accounts called ‘Japarton /ジャパートン’. Defenders Rion Ishikawa and Hikaru Kitagawa, and midfielders Yūka Momiki and Honoka Hayashi were racking up tens of thousands of views posting Q&A videos in Japanese and vlogging their days at the club.\n\n“We’ve got four young Japanese football players who are living together in the city of Liverpool and just having a great time,” Duckmanton tells The Athletic. “Let’s embrace this and see where it goes.”\n\nA few weeks ago, Everton’s training ground chefs served traditional Japanese food, with the subsequent taste test posted across Everton’s own channels. “On those platforms that we know the Japanese market are looking at, on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, we’ve featured those players quite heavily,” says Duckmanton.\n\n“We’ve got this perfect storm of wanting to increase the visibility of Everton Women, the league’s continued expansion internationally and players who’ve really bought into that, and are at the heart of what social media is because they’ve grown up with it. By them creating their own content and their own channels, the club has seen a massive uplift.”\n\nWhile fans from Liverpool and Greater Manchester still dominate ticket sales for Everton Women, international growth opens up new revenue streams. The women’s team pages on Everton’s website have enjoyed a 33 per cent increase in traffic from Japan, according to Duckmanton.\n\n“The impact that these players are having, plus the growth of the Women’s Super League (WSL), is translating back to direct interest in Everton Football Club,” Duckmanton says. “We’re really starting to see our Japanese fans come through and start to become an active member of our community.”\n\nHe outlines the trajectory: fans to purchasers, purchasers to subscribers to Everton TV, and on and on. The goal is that “in a year’s time, two years’ time, they’ll be die-hard Evertonians. But they’re not from Liverpool. That’s the beauty of international fandom.”\n\nThe trend isn’t limited to Everton.\n\nWhen the WSL moved its non-broadcast games to YouTube ahead of the 2024-25 season, it found a large audience in Japan.\n\nThe country accounted for 21 per cent of the audience for Everton’s opening game against Brighton & Hove Albion that season; the UK audience was 40 per cent. Japan also made up 27 per cent of the audience for Manchester City versus West Ham in October 2024, compared to the UK audience of 28 per cent, according to YouTube.\n\nWith the help of global sports marketing agency IMG to extend rights distribution abroad, 13 international broadcasters are showing WSL matches during the 2025-26 season. Though the availability of matches on YouTube depended on the terms of those existing broadcast deals in different countries, there was still an encouraging pattern in Japan.\n\nSeventy-six per cent of the WSL’s broadcast audience last season came from outside of the UK, according to figures supplied by the WSL, but Japan is a particular hotbed of potential. Outside of the UK, Japan is second only to the U.S. in terms of WSL fanbase size, according to the latest YouGov report on the WSL’s international appeal.\n\nThe formula for success is a mix of availability and representation.\n\nThe visibility helps attract talent. The WSL sent more players to the 2023 World Cup than any other league, and opens up hitherto unexplored commercial markets.\n\nIn the 2023-24 season, for example, Japan midfielder Fuka Nagano was the most-requested name on Liverpool Women shirts after their homegrown midfielder Missy Bo Kearns. Discussions with brands and sponsors can take on a global tilt.\n\nThe YouTube data led directly to the sale of WSL rights to Japanese streaming service U-Next, via a partnership with sports marketing agency Pitch International. “They took that YouTube data to start a conversation,” said Zarah Al-Kudcy, the chief revenue officer at WSL Football. “We were able to demonstrate the audience that they will inherit.\n\n“The feedback came that (Japan is) very athlete-centric in how they present a lot of their rights. They also carry the Premier League, and they liked that we had 12 (Japanese) players in our league.”\n\nThe WSL also has another virtual behemoth to credit for its sustained international growth: EA Sports FC, previously the FIFA video games series.\n\n“The EA data shows that the younger generations are finding (the WSL) and educating themselves through the game,” continues Al-Kudcy, who previously worked in marketing and sponsorship roles at Sky and Formula One, and on organising committees for rugby union and cricket World Cups.\n\nThe biggest driver has been the game’s Ultimate Team feature, which allows players to build a dream squad comprising male and female players from around the world. Al-Kudcy recalls attending the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, and seeing posters for Chelsea forward Sam Kerr promoting what was then FIFA 23.\n\n“The ability of EA to cut through internationally is huge,” she adds. “I think that’s what’s changing the fandom. They tend to be more educated because they’ve learned stuff through the game.”\n\nThe research, she says, indicates that those gamers are substantially more likely to engage with the league — buying merchandise and subscriptions and following on social media — than football fans who don’t play the game.\n\nWhile growth at clubs like Arsenal and Manchester United has been spearheaded by the most visible Lionesses, teams without an England international must look to other ways to market their talent.\n\nJapan was the eighth most-represented country in the WSL in the second half of last season, and there were 19 players in the league in the first half of the 24-25 campaign. In addition to Everton’s quartet, Hinata Miyazawa, the golden boot winner at the 2023 World Cup, recently re-signed with Manchester United; Manchester City’s reigning player of the year is Japan midfielder Yui Hasegawa.\n\nThere is precedent in the men’s game for this: Tim Cahill, Tim Howard and Landon Donovan saw Everton fans spring up in Australia and the U.S.. “When we signed James Rodriguez, our Colombian fanbase overnight grew by 4,000 per cent,” Duckmanton continues.\n\n“We know the power that comes with players. The challenge is retaining them: how do we build something so authentic in that region (that) furthers the journey into being a fully-fledged Evertonian — that makes them see past the individual players that we have — even when those players are no longer playing for the football club?”\n\nThe WSL has the advantage of effectively being the sister to the Premier League, whose own figures have it broadcast to 189 countries and 900 million homes across the world.\n\nThe Premier League’s Summer Series in the U.S. is indicative of its growing focus on the international market and, increasingly, WSL clubs are committing to their own overseas tours. In August last year, Crystal Palace Women played their first overseas match, against Utah Royals, while Manchester City Women toured Australia in 2024 and Arsenal Women and Chelsea played matches in the U.S. last summer.\n\nThe Premier League’s global influence is “what has set them apart from a lot of the other men’s leagues,” says Al-Kudcy, and the aim is for the WSL to “achieve similar growth — and I don’t necessarily mean in numbers, but in understanding the principles that they’ve looked at in building their brand globally.” A strength of Premier League clubs, she continues, is “knowing their target markets”.\n\n“It’s not a surprise that for Arsenal Women, Australia is massive, given the number of Matildas (in the squad),” she adds. “So how do we work with them on building that momentum in Australia?” Major tournaments or new signings crossing with the WSL’s significant markets is especially advantageous.\n\nMost clubs are now global brands: Chelsea and Liverpool are the second and third-most supported WSL teams in Japan, according to the latest YouGov report (commissioned by the WSL) on the league’s global appeal.\n\n“In Japanese football history, almost no one has played (at clubs) such as Manchester City, United or Chelsea, like, big clubs, before,” says Momiki, who made her WSL debut at Leicester City in January 2024 before moving to Everton this summer. “I think most Japanese fans are really excited about this. In (the) WSL, the level is (of) one of the top leagues in the world right now.”\n\nManchester City Women are the most popular WSL club in Japan, which Nils Nielsen, the Greenlandic-Danish manager of the Japan women’s national team who also served as Manchester City Women’s director of football during the 23-24 season, attributes in part to their connection to Yokohama F. Marinos, also part of the City Football Group. City’s men’s team toured Japan in 2023, playing against Yokohama, and its trophy tour included stops in Japan this year. That kind of engagement is more significant than the Premier League histories of the clubs, he says.\n\n“I think that (the WSL) is more interesting to watch because there are so many Japanese players,” Nielsen says. “It’s not necessarily because the WSL is more interesting than everything else, but it becomes interesting when you have almost the entire national team based in England.”\n\nIn England, the most high-profile Lionesses have attained mainstream fame. At times, it feels like the health of the WSL rests on the continued growth of their profiles. Those same stars do not dominate the conversation around the WSL in Japan, Nielsen says.\n\nFans are likely to know of the players “that everyone knows” — they will know of Chloe Kelly’s penalty technique, for instance — but little of those players’ histories or positions. “Fans of anybody other than the Japanese — I doubt there are too many of those,” he says. “They do follow it, but it’s mostly because of the Japanese girls, not because they have any connection with the teams and such.”\n\nJapanese players command significant commercial power in their own country: Hasegawa can be seen on billboards in Tokyo.\n\n“It’s a different world for them now than it was before,” Nielsen says. “It gives them so many more options, and it doesn’t really matter if they’re based in Japan. When it comes to the financial part, it’s an advantage to be based abroad because the audience is bigger and they will be more visible.\n\n“It is not as big as in some of the English-speaking countries — as it is in Australia and New Zealand — but after how it was five or 10 years ago, this is massive. The players are much more well-known now than when they were world champions. Now, it’s more accessible and it is more normal for the Japanese to look outside of the country.”\n\nThat broader outlook also applies to Japanese players, who, Nielsen says, are now more open to the prospect of playing in England than ever; there is less anxiety over the language barrier, and improved job security and money. Before the 2023-24 season, only eight Japanese players had featured in the WSL in its 12-year history.\n\nThe drawback for Japan’s WE League is a talent drain. Japanese players make their debuts domestically before moving abroad.\n\n“(In) my second year in Sweden (playing for Linkoping), I’d already decided that my next step is definitely England,” says Everton’s Momiki. “I asked the agent to contact only English teams. I need to get better on my physical aspect, not only my intelligence or skills. So coming to England is really challenging myself. I think the other Japanese player(s) think the same way.\n\n“Sometimes, I’ve found Japanese fans in the stadium. I think they’re coming to the Japanese players’ clubs. I think Japanese people don’t watch Arsenal versus Crystal Palace, because there’s no Japanese players. But Leicester against West Ham or against Manchester City, I think many Japanese people are coming to watch now.”\n\nThe WSL is a global women’s football league. Now, it has to consolidate that status.\n\n“We have to be more than just the audience that comes to the matchday,” concludes Al-Kudcy. “We do have to think about our global fan group as well.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nEverton, Soccer, Sports Business, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "WACO, Texas (AP) — Iowa State point guard Tamin Lipsey, the senior who grew up near campus in Ames, is now part of something that had never been done by the Cyclones. They have a 15-game winning streak to start the season.\n\n“I’ve been a Cyclone all my life. Just got on the court four years ago, though,” Lipsey said Wednesday night following a 70-60 victory at Baylor. “Watching all those teams growing up and just realizing that I have a chance right now to make a footprint for Iowa State, and just the community of Ames and all of that, I never take for granted.”\n\nLipsey scored 24 points, overcoming some early foul trouble that kept him on the bench for nearly eight minutes in the first half. Joshua Jefferson had 19 points and 17 rebounds for Iowa State (15-0, 2-0 Big 12).\n\nThe Cyclones' 15-0 start and 15-game winning streak are both school records, surpassing a 14-0 start by the 2013-14 team that reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. They are one of six undefeated Division I teams, along with No. 1 Arizona, No. 2 Michigan, No. 10 Nebraska, No. 11 Vanderbilt and unranked Miami, Ohio.\n\n“I think these guys do such a great job at honoring all those who have come before us with the effort and the execution that they play with,” fifth-year Cyclones coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “So it’s a great accomplishment. It’s a credit to the young men and how they work. And hopefully something that the past Cyclones who have been in this program and those that have invested can take tremendous pride in.”\n\nJefferson, a senior forward and second-year transfer from Saint Mary's, already had his sixth double-double of the season by halftime.\n\nHis long-3-pointer with 5 seconds left in the first half gave the Cyclones their first lead at 25-24. They never gave that up, starting the second half with a 14-1 run when six players scored and Jefferson capped it with a fast-break dunk.\n\n“A huge shot Joshua made just before the half,\" Otzelberger said. “A huge momentum play that carried into that second half.”\n\nLipsey has started all 115 of his games in four seasons with the Cyclones, including three NCAA Tournament appearances and a Sweet 16 in that time. He came out after his second foul with 17:12 left in the first half and didn't return until the 9:19 mark. He finally scored with 6:11 left in the first half, then had 20 points after halftime.\n\n\"I'd take him over any point guard in America,\" Otzelberger said. “Obviously, not having Tamin out there quite as much in the first half impacted where the game was at. But man, in that second half, the plays he made, the shots he made, it was amazing — especially when you have to bounce back when your normal routine and rhythm of a game is disrupted because of the fouls.”\n\nAfter the Cyclones shot 27.8% from the field (10 of 36) in the first half, they were at 57.1% (16 of 28) after halftime.\n\nOn the defensive side, they held Baylor to 18.8% (6 of 32) before halftime and 30.6% (19 of 62) overall.\n\n“Iowa State is a really good team. If you ask me, right now, today, them and Michigan are the two best in college basketball,” Baylor coach Scott Drew said. “They’re not going to beat themselves. They know exactly where they’re going to be, how they’re going to do things. T.J. has done a great job with them.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "It was fun while it lasted",
    "fullText": "Interim head coach Calum McFarlane was hoping to build on Sunday’s rousing 1-1 draw at the Etihad and hand the team off to new full-time head coach Liam Rosenior (who was in attendance last night) with good momentum, but yet another red card consigned the Blues to yet another poor result, losing 2-1 at Craven Cottage. It was Chelsea’s league-leading fifth (5th!) red card of the season. Everton are the only other team to have more than two, after they had two players sent off late on yesterday.\n\nWith Chelsea also high up on the yellow cards list (fourth most in the league), the team’s discipline (or lack thereof) has been drawn into sharp focus of late. This is a rather familiar concern with this (still) young team, though for McFarlane, Marc Cucurella’s red card was more of a footballing incident than one stemming from poor discipline. (The multitude of yellows that followed were a different story.)\n\nOf course, discipline can also be about focus and mental sharpness, and Cucu’s red was certainly not the first boneheaded mistake to doom us to defeat in recent times.\n\n“There’s been a lot made of the red cards this season. I don’t think this red card is ill-disciplined. This is football. This happens in football. You get caught one-v-one and Marc is one of the best defenders in the world. So, he would defend that situation nine times out of 10. Harry Wilson’s clever and he shows quality as well. He’s a very good player.\n\n“So, we got caught from a football and structural standpoint. So, that red card is not a lack of ill-discipline. The three yellow cards directly after is something we’ll have to look at, but I would argue that we don’t want that to happen, obviously.\n\nI would then argue that they showed discipline to not get another yellow card in a tough game with 10 men. So, you can look at it either way. So, it’s definitely something we have to look at. I’m not shying away from that. But that red card wasn’t down to ill-discipline.“\n\nMcFarlane tried his best to still get something out of this game, but Fulham would retake the lead after Liam Delap’s equalizer, meaning that we now have just eight points from our last nine games. That’s relegation form for a team aiming for trophies returns-on-investments.\n\n“[The red card] changes your plans in and out of possession and what you want to do. [In] the first 20 minutes, we were really aggressive on the press, really embracing man-for-man presses, man-for-man structures. We nicked it three or four times in the first 20 minutes. That changes. You can’t really press like that with 10 men. We had to be a little bit more compact, defend, fight, defend our box and wait for moments.\n\n“I thought we did that really well. I thought we had a lot of moments in the second half where we scored the goal, where we could have scored the goal. I thought we defended our box really well, other than, to be fair, a really high-level bit of quality from Harry Wilson to win the game. That was the message at half-time. We’re going to have to fight. We’re going to have to dig in. The game plan is different, but let’s embrace that.\n\n“[…] These guys want to win so much. They’re competitors. […] These lads are great lads, great fighters, great competitors. They will learn from [this] and we get better.”\n\n-Calum McFarlane; \n\nWell, over to you, Liam Rosenior.",

    "description": "Find out who got a 10 and who is facing an uncertain international future with our Ashes player ratings.",
    "fullText": "The Ashes series is over and, once again, it finishes with Australia holding the urn.\n\nEngland did avoid a clean sweep with victory in Melbourne but Australia reasserted their dominance in Sydney this week.\n\nHere we hand out player ratings for the whole series.\n\nZak Crawley – 5 – Averaged 27, which was entirely predictable at the beginning of the series. Did not live up to the billing of a man backed for Australia and should not be guaranteed a place for the home summer.\n\nBen Duckett – 3 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best all-format batters in the world, leaves with career at a crossroads. Did not pass 50, dropped catches and was caught on video in Noosa. Now goes to England's white-ball tours and the Indian Premier League, when a break might be the smart option.\n\nJacob Bethell – 7 – Where has he been? How different might England's tour have turned out had they backed Bethell sooner? Only two Tests, but a vital 40 in Melbourne was followed by a coming-of-age 154 in Sydney. England's new number three.\n\nJoe Root – 7 – Finally ticked off the Test century in Australia and got another in Sydney, but not much else. Still England's best batter at 35 and wants to come back in four years. Where would they be without him?\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Should have been the series when he announced himself as a Test mega-star and instead was one of too many frustrating dismissals. Has a lot on his plate as white-ball captain - is that hindering his development as a Test batter?\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Another England captain to be beaten down under and will not get another chance to win a series here. England's best bowler, below his best with the bat and a poor series tactically. Gets an extra mark for shouldering the burden of the many team-mates that let him down.\n\nJamie Smith – 3 – Like Duckett, arrived as an England banker and leaves with his international future in doubt. Mistakes with the gloves and too many soft dismissals - his shot in Sydney encapsulated England's bone-headed tour. Dropped from the white-ball teams, is a Test axe next?\n\nWill Jacks – 5 – Did what he was asked to do, which was bowl some part-time off-spin and bat at eight - it is just that no-one expected him to do it in four Tests. Would be unfair to judge on a role Jacks isn't really qualified for. When might he play another Test?\n\nBrydon Carse – 6 – A total of 22 wickets for a fast bowler has been bettered only by James Anderson and Ian Botham on England Ashes tours in the past 55 years. The numbers don't quite tell the story of how often he sprayed the ball. Having the durability to play all five Tests says plenty about his character.\n\nMatthew Potts – 1 – Probably harsh, given the hand he was dealt. His sole appearance in Sydney was tough to watch. Mistreated by England - in and out, ignored for a year, then dropped into an Ashes Test. Will surely slip further down the pecking order.\n\nJosh Tongue – 7 – Didn't play until the third Test, then managed to pick up 18 wickets. One of the few England players to leave Australia with his reputation enhanced and should be in the first-choice attack come the summer.\n\nMark Wood – 2 – A Herculean effort to get fit, only for his series to end after bowling 11 overs in the first Test. Will he play for England again?\n\nJofra Archer – 6 – Bowled better than a total of nine wickets would suggest and at times was among England's best batters. Injured after three matches as a reminder (if it was needed) he will need constant managing through the remainder of his Test career.\n\nOllie Pope – 3 – Started with promise, then predictably faded to be rightly dropped after three Tests. Did not repay faith shown in him and should have to work very hard for another chance.\n\nGus Atkinson – 3 – One of the many who wilted in the first two Tests, then hinted at something near his best in the fourth, only to get injured. No longer a guaranteed part of England's first-choice attack.\n\nShoaib Bashir – 0 – Was earmarked for this tour in an experiment of building a spinner from raw materials, then could not get a game in any of the five Tests.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nThe Ashes: Australia beat England in final Test - clips and reaction\n\nJake Weatherald – 4 – Started well with vital cameos in the first two Tests, only to be found out later in the series. An Ashes winner, but possibly not Australia's long-term opener.\n\nTravis Head – 10 – The best three-format batter in the world and a likeable superstar. His elevation to opener altered the course of the series and three hundreds mean the spot is his to keep. This was the Travball Ashes.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne - 5 - Yet to score the runs that fully justify his recall at number three. Gets an extra mark for his catching - he took three stunners. Unclear whether his bowling deserves praise or eradicating from cricket history.\n\nSteve Smith – 7 – Was below his best with the bat until a predictable century in Sydney. Stood-in as captain for Pat Cummins in four Tests, which means he did not have Cummins the bowler at his disposal, yet still engineered an Ashes triumph.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 5 – A strange culmination to his career. Khawaja's Ashes will be remembered for the batting he did not do in Perth, rather than the innings he played everywhere else.\n\nAlex Carey – 9 – One of the greatest exhibitions of glovework ever seen in a Test series and handy runs at number six, including a hometown century in Adelaide. Admitted to not walking in the same knock, setting the wheels in motion for the Snicko revelation. Hit winning runs in Sydney to seal 4-1 series win.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Losing his way after being earmarked as the future face of the Australian team. Injuries are limiting his bowling and a lack of runs have him slipping down the order - possibly to number 12.\n\nBeau Webster – 5 – When he finally got his chance he made the runs that should put pressure on Green's place, then proved how versatile he is with his off-breaks.\n\nMichael Neser – 7 – Out of Test cricket for three years then recalled as injury cover and a pink-ball specialist. Did a fine job as the sort of medium-fast bowler England have shown disdain for.\n\nMitchell Starc – 10 – This series was essentially decided in the first two Tests and Starc was the primary reason Australia won both. Faded slightly towards the end, but at his best gave off Mitchell Johnson 2013-14 vibes - there can be no higher praise.\n\nScott Boland – 7 – Not quite the heights of his debut series four years ago, though did more than enough to banish the demons of a tough 2023 Ashes in England.\n\nBrendan Doggett – 4 – Covered for injuries in the first two Tests and claimed a respectable seven wickets. May never add to his two Test caps, yet is an Ashes winner with a 100% record.\n\nPat Cummins – 6 – Astonishing effort to have played even one Test, given the severity of his back injury. In his sole appearance in Adelaide, Cummins bowled magnificently and was the captain that sealed the Ashes. Will now plot the bid for a holy grail win in 2027.\n\nNathan Lyon – 4 – Was making an impact in Adelaide before being struck by another injury. Will want to be part of 2027 Ashes, but surely there will be questions over his fitness and the role of spin in England.\n\nJosh Inglis – 3 – Australia won the two Tests he played, even if he did not take his chance. May get another opportunity as a result of Khawaja's retirement, or could fall down the pecking order.\n\nJhye Richardson – 2 – Like Wood, deserves huge credit for coming back from injuries to play Test cricket, albeit for one match and 9.2 overs. Should get another chance.\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win",

Early in the second period, Canadian Olympic defenseman Thomas Harley made the play to set up Sam Steel’s net-front tap-in past Thompson\n\nSteel assisted on Wyatt Johnston’s goal, his 24th of the season, with 6:29 left in regulation. Roope Hintz sealed it with an empty-netter with 18.6 seconds remaining.\n\nBefore that, Alex Ovechkin scored his 915th career goal, adding to his NHL record total, with 2:19 left and Thompson pulled for an extra attacker. It was Ovechkin’s 18th goal of the season at age 40.\n\nMONTREAL (AP) — Alexandre Texier had a goal and two assists, Jacob Fowler made 28 saves and Montreal beat Calgary.\n\nLane Hutson, Oliver Kapanen and Cole Caufield also scored to help Montreal improve to 24-13-6.\n\nJoel Farabee scored for Calgary, and Dustin Wolf stopped 31 shots. The Flames dropped to 18-21-4.\n\nTexier opened the scoring 3:10 into the second period when he took the puck at the goal line and roofed it over Wolf’s shoulder.\n\nAfter Phillip Danault’s chance out of the penalty box, Texier got the puck back to him, and Danault found Hutson alone in the slot. Hutson fired a slap shot past Wolf. Just 1:07 later, Kapanen finished off a rebound to make it 3-0.\n\nFarabee beat Fowler with a shot from the left circle with 2:21 left in the second.\n\nCaufield took a Texier pass and fired a rolling puck past Wolf for his 21st goal 3:56 into the third period.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Lawson Crouse and John Marino scored in a 3:21 span in the first period, Karel Vejmelka made 33 saves and Utah beat Ottawa to cap a big day for the franchise.\n\nThe Mammoth won hours after the NHL announced the team will host the 2027 Winter Classic at the University of Utah’s football stadium.\n\nClayton Keller assisted on the first-period goals, and Daniil But also scored. The Mammoth opened a seven-game homestand, rebounding from a 3-2 overtime loss to the New York Rangers on Monday night.\n\nRidly Greig scored for Ottawa, and Leevi Merilainen stopped 18 shots. Greig has scored in all four games he has played against Utah.\n\nCrouse opened the scoring from the slot at 3:59, and Marino scored off a rebound at 7:20. Greig scored through a crowd in front for Ottawa with 2:19 left in the opening period.\n\nBut made it 3-1 at 5:41 of the third on a wild scramble in front. The goal survived a video review for goalie interference.\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — Oliver Moore and Connor Murphy scored during Chicago’s four-goal second period, and the Blackhawks beat St. Louis for its fourth consecutive win.\n\nMoore, Murphy, Louis Crevier and Landon Slaggert each had a goal and an assist as Chicago improved to 2-1-0 against St. Louis this season. Spencer Knight made 27 saves and Nick Lardis, Jason Dickinson and Andre Burakovsky also scored.\n\nChicago went 3 for 4 on the power play, while St. Louis was 0 for 5 with the man advantage. The Blackhawks are 8 for 8 on the penalty kill during their win streak.\n\nTyler Tucker, Otto Stenberg and Nathan Walker scored for St. Louis in the opener of a three-game trip. Jordan Binnington stopped 28 shots.\n\nChicago grabbed control in the second. Stenberg tied it at 2 with his first career goal at 8:22, but the Blackhawks regained the lead 35 seconds later on Murphy’s first of the season.\n\nSlaggert got a piece of Colton Dach’s shot at 12:27, and Dickinson made it 5-2 when he redirected Crevier’s shot for his fifth goal with 2:36 left in the period.\n\nBurakovsky added a power-play goal 5:11 into the third. It was his first goal since Dec. 20 and No. 10 on the season.",

    "title": "Another poor finish — combined with a disastrous start — costs Runnin’ Utes in loss at Colorado",
    "description": "Utah’s lack of execution to start and finish the game was too much much to overcome.",
    "fullText": "The fight was there Wednesday night for Utah when the Runnin’ Utes took on Colorado at the CU Events Center in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIt’s been an issue all year for Utah in its first year under head coach Alex Jensen.\n\nThe latest example of this came in an 87-75 loss to the Buffaloes.\n\n“The big thing is that we didn’t finish possessions down the last four minutes,” Utah assistant coach Raphael Chillious said in a postgame interview on ESPN 700 AM.\n\nThe Utes, after a disastrous 11-1 start to the game, fought their way back into the matchup and even briefly grabbed a first-half lead.\n\nAfter Colorado built its lead back up late in the first half and into double-digits in the second half, the Utes made headway and trimmed their deficit to two twice in the final seven-plus minutes.\n\nThe last time came with 3:58 to play, when Keanu Dawes hit a jumper to make it 69-67.\n\nWhat happened next will be scrutinized by Utah coaches, though, as Colorado (12-3, 2-0 Big 12) outscored the Utes 16-6 the rest of the way. That included an 8-0 run that all but put the game away.\n\nThough the Utes had more offensive rebounds (14-13) and second-chance points (15-11), the Buffaloes’ next points came on a putback, when Bangot Dak grabbed his fourth offensive rebound of the game and dunked home two points.\n\nUtah (8-7, 0-2 Big 12) had only seven turnovers in the game, one off its season low, but two of those turnovers came at critical moments.\n\nFirst, with the Buffaloes holding onto that 71-67 lead, Utah had a chance to make it a one-possession game again, but Terrence Brown lost the ball with three minutes to play, and it resulted in two Isaiah Johnson free throws on a fastbreak opportunity to extend the lead to six.\n\nOn the Utes’ next possession, Don McHenry’s only turnover of the night spoiled another opportunity and Colorado capitalized with a score inside from Barrington Hargress.\n\nAt that point, the damage was done.\n\nColorado’s 11-1 run to begin the game came after No. 1 Arizona had a similar start against the Utes in the Big 12 opener — in that contest, the Wildcats stormed out to a 14-2 lead.\n\nThe Buffaloes made their first four field goals of the night before Utah had much time to breathe, and it caused Utah to call timeout to regroup.\n\nTake out the first two and a half minutes of the game and the final four minutes, and Utah outscored the Buffaloes 68-60.\n\nThat’s not how it works, though — the Utes are still searching on how to play a full 40 minutes.\n\n“We’re coming together as a team,” Chillious said of a group with 12 newcomers that’s been joined by a midyear addition and walk-on in recent weeks. “It takes a while to build it, but we show them those four minutes on each side of it, and say, ‘Look, if we clean up (the first) four minutes, last four minutes, we’re going to be in a lot of games.’\n\n“I think our guys do their best to execute the game plan, and then, like you said, we get to that middle portion, we’re pretty good. We still (need to) learn how to finish. Gotta learn how to start.”\n\nThis all came despite Utah’s Big 3 — Dawes, Brown and McHenry — leading the way again for the Utes.\n\nMcHenry scored 18 of his game-high 24 points in the first half, and he added seven rebounds and an assist.\n\nDawes added 16 points and seven rebounds, to go with two assists and a steal.\n\nBrown tossed in 16 points, though that came on 5 of 17 shooting from the field and 6 of 8 from the free-throw line. He accounted for nearly half (three) of Utah’s turnovers.\n\nA troubling trend for Utah’s starting guard lineup happened again against Colorado. After McHenry and Brown combined to shoot 11 of 19 in the first half, they struggled from the field after the half. This time, it came to the tune of shooting a combined 3 of 20.\n\n“They made some adjustments,” Chillious said of Colorado. “I think (McHenry and Brown) missed some shots they normally make. You know, that’s the nature of the beast. We tried to get Don a couple more quick rests to try to back going. But sometimes you have it going, sometimes you don’t.”\n\nColorado’s balance — and depth — was superior, too.\n\nThe Buffaloes had four players in double-figures, and their bench outscored Utah’s 33-8.\n\nDak put up a double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds, as Colorado outrebounded the Utes 41-35. He also had three blocks, two assists and a steal.\n\nSebastian Rancik made contributions in a variety of ways as well, with a team-high 19 points, four rebounds, two assists and two blocks, while Johnson (12) and Alon Michaeli (10) scored in double-figures, too.\n\nUtah will get another shot at Colorado later this season, when the Utes host the Buffaloes on March 3.\n\nFor now, it all adds up to a third straight loss for Utah as it heads into another particularly difficult portion of its schedule — the Utes host their rivals, No. 9 BYU, at the Huntsman Center on Saturday, before hitting the road next Wednesday against No. 14 Texas Tech.\n\n“I think we’ve gotta get on the bus, watch the film and flush this one, and then we know what’s coming in. I mean, it’s BYU Saturday. It could be it could be Kansas on Saturday. It’s the Big 12, you know,” Chillious said. “We have to prepare for the game like, yes, BYU is a monster — so is everyone else in this league.\n\n“We got to get our guys back quickly. Get focused on BYU. First of all, execute the game plan and hopefully come out with a better start and see what happens.”",

    "fullText": "2026 represents a new chapter for South Florida football, as the Bulls flip from the Alex Golesh era to the Brian Hartline era.\n\nSouth Florida lost three-year starter Byrum Brown in the transfer portal, as the star dual-threat quarterback followed Golesh to Auburn. In return, the Bulls received a quarterback with substantial starting experience in the SEC.\n\nSouth Florida received a commitment on Wednesday, Jan. 7 from quarterback Michael Van Buren Jr., who suited up at Mississippi State in 2024 and LSU in 2025. Van Buren arrives with 12 games of starting experience, serving the majority of the 2024 campaign as the Bulldogs’ first-string QB and taking over as the Tigers’ starter during the last quarter and change of 2025.\n\nAs a true freshman in 2024, Van Buren threw for 1,886 yards, 11 touchdowns, and seven interceptions on a 54.7 completion rate. He collected 300 passing yards in two games that year, notably firing for 306 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-31 track meet defeat at Georgia.\n\nVan Buren transferred to LSU in December 2024, entering the year as the backup to Garrett Nussmeier. He ultimately took over as the Tigers’ primary quarterback on Nov. 8 against Alabama and retained the starting role for the final four games. He captained victories over Arkansas and WKU and nearly guided LSU to a major upset over a CFP-bound Oklahoma squad. Van Buren earned his last start in purple and gold in the Texas Bowl vs. Houston, where he exhibited some of his best work to date. He accumulated 267 passing yards, three touchdowns, and zero interceptions on a 16-of-26 showing, guiding LSU to 35 points in a narrow defeat — when LSU never surpassed 25 against an FBS opponent in the regular season.\n\nVan Buren’s mobility also improved as a true sophomore, racking up 129 yards on the season (105 in his four starts). The Bowie, MD native rattled off a 15+ yard carry in all four starts — a helpful trait if South Florida wants a similar style QB to Byrum Brown.\n\nSpeaking of Brown, Van Buren enters Tampa with massive shoes to fill. Brown is the only quarterback in USF history to surpass 3,000 passing yards in a season, and he did it twice. Brown just set the record for most passing touchdowns in a season by any Bull by 28, and he left the program ranked third all-time in rushing yards at 2,265.\n\nVan Buren takes over as a potential starter under Hartline and his new staff, as the former SEC quarterback takes on his third different school in a three-year span.",

    "description": "“Her journey is a reminder of the rewards that come from patience, belief and hard work”, writes Charlotte Patterson",
    "fullText": "There’s something uniquely satisfying about watching a footballer grow in front of your eyes.\n\nNot simply improving or accumulating minutes, but evolving technically, tactically, physically, and emotionally into a player that embodies the identity of the club they represent — and for Sunderland Women, Jessica Brown has become one of those players.\n\nHer journey from academy hopeful to first team mainstay isn’t just a story of individual development — it’s a testament to the strength of the club’s youth pathway, patient and effective coaching, and the value of trusting young players to find their place. In many ways, Brown represents the best of Sunderland’s commitment to nurturing talent and her rise has been one of the most compelling narratives of the last few seasons.\n\nBrown’s early years in the Sunderland academy were marked by the kind of quiet consistency that often goes unnoticed outside the training ground.\n\nShe was never the loudest personality nor the flashiest player, but she possessed natural athleticism and a willingness to learn that made her stand out to coaches. Even then, she had the raw ingredients that would later define her senior career: stamina that seemed almost inexhaustible, a competitive edge in duels and a technical base that allowed her to adapt to different roles.\n\nThose who watched her closely in the youth ranks often spoke about her maturity, her ability to absorb tactical information and her refusal to be intimidated by older or more physically developed players. It was clear that she had something — even if the exact shape of her future role wasn’t obvious.\n\nHer earliest senior appearances came as a winger, a position that suited her pace and directness. Sunderland used her sparingly at first, giving her minutes late in games or in cup fixtures where the pressure was slightly lower. These cameo appearances were important — not only for her confidence but for her understanding of the senior game.\n\nThe jump from academy football to the WSL2 (then The Championship) is significant, and Brown had to learn quickly how to cope with the physicality, the speed of decision‑making, and the tactical discipline required at that level. But even in those early outings, she showed flashes of promise, with a willingness to take on defenders, an ability to deliver teasing balls into the box and a defensive work rate that hinted at the positional shift that would later define her career.\n\nAs Sunderland’s squad evolved and the tactical demands shifted, Brown found herself gradually moving down the pitch. After beginning as a winger who tracked back diligently, she soon became a wide midfielder with defensive responsibilities and eventually a full back or wing back, depending on the system.\n\nThis transition wasn’t forced upon her; instead, it emerged naturally given her strengths.\n\nHer coaches recognised that her engine, timing in the tackle and ability to read the game made her well‑suited to a role that required both defensive solidity and attacking ambition. Brown embraced the change with the same openness that had characterised her academy years, and it was in this new position that she truly began to flourish.\n\nThe modern full‑back is expected to be a hybrid footballer, capable of defending one‑on‑one, supporting the midfield, and contributing to the attack — and Brown has grown into this role with remarkable assurance.\n\nDefensively, she’s become one of Sunderland’s most reliable performers. Her tackling technique is clean and assertive, and she rarely dives in recklessly. Instead, she waits for the right moment, using her body shape to shepherd opponents into less dangerous areas before stepping in decisively.\n\nHer recovery pace is another key asset, allowing her to track runners, cover for centre backs, and win back possession in transition. There’s a relentlessness to her defensive work that’s become a hallmark of her game; a kind of controlled aggression that lifts the players around her and sets the tone for the team’s out‑of‑possession structure. It’s the sort of quality that makes supporters appreciate the unseen graft that underpins every successful defensive unit.\n\nGoing forward, Brown offers a different but equally valuable set of qualities.\n\nHer background as a winger is evident in the way she carries the ball, the angles she chooses when overlapping, and the confidence with which she attacks space. She has developed a strong understanding with the midfielders ahead of her, timing her runs to stretch the opposition and create overloads on the flank.\n\nHer delivery into the box has improved season by season, and she now produces crosses with real purpose; whipped balls across the six‑yard area, cutbacks to the edge of the box and lofted deliveries to the far post. These aren’t hopeful punts — they’re measured contributions that consistently ask questions of defenders.\n\nHer attacking output isn’t limited to crossing, either.\n\nBrown is increasingly comfortable when driving inside, combining with teammates, and even taking on shots when the opportunity arises. She’s become a genuine “dual‑threat” full back, capable of influencing the game at both ends of the pitch.\n\nDespite limited minutes and appearances thus far, the 2025/2026 season has been particularly impressive for Brown, who’s stepped into a more prominent role within the squad. Sunderland’s tactical approach this season has placed significant emphasis on width, transitional speed, and defensive resilience — all areas in which Brown excels.\n\nEven after a period of time during which Brown found herself out of contention in the starting eleven, she kept her head down, worked hard in training and ensured she was ready for the call when it came.\n\nHer performances have been marked by a level of consistency that’s rare for a player still in the early stages of her senior career. Week after week, she delivers the same intensity, the same commitment, and the same willingness to push herself physically.\n\nHer running power has become one of Sunderland’s most valuable assets, allowing the team to maintain pressure, stretch opponents, and recover quickly when possession is lost. It’s no exaggeration to say that her engine is among the best in the league and her ability to sustain high intensity levels of effort for ninety minutes has become a defining feature of her game.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Brown’s development has been her confidence in defensive duels.\n\nShe no longer looks like a converted winger learning the ropes; instead, she looks like a natural full back who relishes the physical battles. Her timing in the tackle has sharpened and she’s developed a knack for winning the ball cleanly even in tight situations.\n\nThere is a bravery to her defending that supporters admire, a willingness to put her body on the line and commit fully to challenges. This is not reckless bravery but calculated commitment, the kind that comes from understanding the game and trusting her own technique — and her tracking back is equally impressive.\n\nWhen Sunderland lose the ball, Brown is often the first player to react, sprinting back with a determination that lifts the entire defensive line. Her recovery runs have prevented countless counter‑attacks and her positional awareness has improved to the point where she rarely gets caught out of shape.\n\nHer attacking contributions have also reached a new level.\n\nBrown’s crossing accuracy has improved and she now delivers balls into the box with a consistency that makes her a genuine creative outlet. Whether Sunderland are chasing a goal or trying to break down a stubborn defence, Brown’s ability to whip in dangerous deliveries has become a key part of the team’s attacking identity.\n\nHer relentless running up and down the flank creates space for others, drags defenders out of position, and forces opponents to constantly adjust their shape. This kind of off‑the‑ball work is often overlooked, but it’s crucial to Sunderland’s ability to control games and create chances. Also, Brown’s willingness to make run after run — even when she’s not the primary target — speaks volumes about her mentality and her commitment to the team.\n\nWhat makes Brown’s rise even more meaningful is the fact that she is a product of Sunderland’s youth system, and during an era where many clubs rely heavily on external recruitment, there’s something deeply satisfying about seeing a homegrown player not only break into the first team but become a key contributor.\n\nBrown’s journey is a reminder of the importance of investing in youth development; of giving young players the time and space to grow and trusting them to adapt to the demands of senior football.\n\nHer success is not just her own: it’s shared by the coaches who nurtured her, the teammates who supported her and the club that believed in her potential. For supporters, there’s a special sense of pride in watching one of their own thrive, and Brown has become a symbol of what Sunderland can achieve when they commit to developing talent from within.\n\nHer evolution from winger to full back also reflects a broader trend in modern football, where versatility and adaptability are increasingly valued.\n\nBrown’s ability to reinvent herself, to embrace a new role and to excel speaks to her intelligence and her work ethic. It’s not easy for a young player to shift positions — especially when it involves taking on greater defensive responsibility — but Brown has handled the transition with maturity beyond her years.\n\nNot only has she adapted, she’s made the position her own by bringing her own style and personality to the role. Her journey is a reminder that development is rarely linear, and that the best players are often those who are willing to evolve.\n\nAs the 2025/2026 season continues, Brown’s importance to Sunderland shows no sign of diminishing.\n\nShe’s once again become one of the first names on the team sheet and a player whose presence provides balance, energy, and reliability. Her performances have earned her admiration not only from supporters but from opponents and pundits who recognise her growing influence.\n\nThere’s also a sense that she’s only just beginning to reach her potential and that the next few years could see her develop into one of the league’s standout full backs. Her ceiling is high and her potential trajectory is steep, but what makes her story so compelling is the grounded, hardworking way she’s gone about her rise.\n\nIn many ways, Brown embodies the values that Sunderland supporters cherish: graft, resilience, humility and a willingness to give everything for the shirt.\n\nShe plays with a determination that resonates deeply with the fanbase, and her journey from academy prospect to first team regular is a source of genuine pride. When watching her now, it’s easy to forget how young she is, how much room she has to grow and how much she’s already achieved. Her development is a reminder of the power of patience, the importance of opportunity, and the value of believing in young players.\n\nAs Sunderland continue to build for the future, Brown will undoubtedly be at the heart of their plans.\n\nShe’s become a cornerstone of the team’s identity, a player who sets standards in training and in matches, and a symbol of what the club can achieve when it trusts its own. Her relentless running, defensive commitment, attacking ambition and unwavering work ethic make her a joy to watch and a nightmare to play against.\n\nShe’s the kind of player every team needs — the kind of player who elevates those around her and the kind of player that represents the very best of Sunderland Women.\n\nHer story is far from finished, but it’s already worth celebrating.\n\nBrown isn’t just a promising young footballer — she’s a tribute to the strength of Sunderland’s academy, the value of perseverance and the beauty of watching a player grow into themselves. In a sport that often moves too quickly, her journey is a reminder of the rewards that come from patience, belief and hard work. Sunderland have a gem on their hands, and as she continues to develop, there’s every reason to believe that her best years are still ahead of her.\n\nFor now, supporters can simply enjoy watching a homegrown talent blossom into one of the most exciting full backs in the league — and a player whose rise reflects not only her own dedication but the enduring spirit of the club she represents.",

    "description": "What were the positives and negatives from Sunderland’s performance in the loss at Brentford?",
    "fullText": "We always knew that coming into the Premier League there would be some bad days at the office. Fortunately up to now we have been spoilt, and this is the first time this season – with the exception of Man City away – where we have been outperformed, so it’s absolutely vital that we understand the context. It’s just one game, and we will be back.\n\nFatigue Finally Catching Up with Us\n\nIt was perhaps inevitable that after such a congested run of fixtures a game like this was on the cards. The first half was similar to Spurs, where we looked leggy and showed signs that our lack of options for rotation were catching up with us. Credit to the team for the way we approached the second half, but after Le Fée’s awful penalty we lost the momentum, and Brentford’s second goal knocked the stuffing out of our tired bodies.\n\nWith the game over, it was actually nice to see Régis Le Bris rest a few of the starting XI and hand a run-out to Dan Neil and Luke O’Nien, as well as Dennis Cirkin following his recent starts. O’Nien saw a lot of the ball and has hopefully put his red card at City well behind him. I hope he stays, but if Luke’s future does lie elsewhere, at least he’s had a solid 15 minutes in the Premier League for Sunderland.\n\nRomaine Mundle is struggling to make an impact in the top flight, and while it’s early days for our promotion-winning favourite, he needs to keep working at his game. Mundle cuts inside too often, to the extent where it is predictable. I’d like to see him given a go on the right just to mix things up.\n\nWe finished the night in tenth position. This was only our fifth defeat of the season. We’ll move on quickly.\n\nThis team is full of spirit and belief. The manager will dust the team off and go again on Saturday. Keep the faith.\n\nThe team looked mentally and physically knackered. This was one game too far. The team had been performing remarkably well against all the odds since the tricky list of fixtures began at the beginning of December. We have not looked out of our depth despite having up to eight first-teamers out due to Africa Cup of Nations commitments and injuries. Today was one game too far, just as we were coming into a period of milder games and with players about to return from Africa.\n\nThat penalty. After the way Enzo Le Fée stuck away his two previous penalties this season with such aplomb, it was reasonable to expect a similar effort. But a simple dink down the neck of Kelleher saw the ball land easily into his grateful arms. Had the keeper dived either way or had Enzo rolled the ball either side of him, it was 1-1. Just another indicator that it wasn’t to be our night.\n\nThere were too many players who didn’t quite cut it tonight, and they have probably lost the chance to secure places in the starting eleven when the international lads return from Africa.\n\nEven Alderete, who has been a colossus, had a poor evening, but we all have a bad day at the office once in a while, and when tired and overworked they come around more often.\n\nFact is we just navigated the AFCON challenge with one loss when it could have been many more, and for such a fledgling team at this level that is pretty decent.\n\nLet’s keep a balanced head, get five more points or so to stay up, then have some fun and see what we can do beyond that.\n\nWe’ve come away from Brentford with no major injuries, which is a major plus given the pressure this squad is under.\n\nTwo Weeks Until the Next League Outing\n\nWe’ve got time to get a fair few of the Lads back from the AFCON, and we need them. The Lads looked tired, and we need the ability to give a few a rest.\n\nThe penalty completely changed the game. We’d brought Mundle and Mayenda on, and we looked a different side. We had our tails up, and it was a stonewall penalty. Score and we push on and could have taken three points. Instead the farcical penalty got their crowd going and their team.\n\nThe Lads have worked amazingly in the last five games, and it really told in the last 30 minutes. They ran out of gas, and we need to get the energy levels back, but the games keep on coming.\n\nWe are finally through this tight schedule of games. You could see the effects of this run of games in the game, but ultimately it could have been worse. This Brentford game is the only one we have lost since AFCON hit and the games started to pile up, which is a credit to the Lads and also not something any of us would have expected. With six gone for AFCON, Ballard missing a couple of games, and Isidor missing some too, coming out of this period with four important points is something to be proud of. Yes, we didn’t play very well tonight, but it is important to remember the limitations we had.\n\nHe did his best with everything that came his way and seemed our only chance to create anything going forward. He is so strong and powerful that the defenders can hardly do anything but foul him. I thought he was unfortunate not to have a better chance to score himself after how hard he worked. Even towards the end of the game he was winning headers and putting himself about. He did magnificently well to win the penalty too. If he continues to play like that, I am sure that more goals will come.\n\nYou have to mention it. I love Enzo as we all do, but don’t do that at any time and especially not when 1-0 down. Just pick your spot and rattle it into the net. But everyone makes mistakes, and I know he will learn from that. He has been brilliant for us this season and has stood out these last few games, so hopefully he can put that behind him and move on. Before the penalty I thought he was playing really well, so there were still some positives to take.\n\nFor the first one the striker is in far too much space. We didn’t react quickly enough to fill the space Mukiele left when he stepped out and got punished. The second goal frustrated me the most. We were let off the hook when they rattled the bar just seconds earlier, but again we were slow to react, leaving the man unmarked at the back post to head back across the box. Conceding from a corner too. With our aerial dominance you would think that defending and attacking corners would be our forte, but we have been poor in both boxes recently.",

    "description": "The lads fell to a clinical Brentford side through a clinical performance from in-form striker Igor Thiago.",
    "fullText": "Regis Le Bris made two changes to the side which drew at Tottenham at the weekend, with Chris Rigg preferred over Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard returning to the starting eleven at the expense of Dennis Cirkin. Trai Hume moved over to left back while Lutsharel Geertruida returned to central midfield.\n\nThe first half began with a competitive midfield battle, but some rustiness at the back, which would telegraph much of the second half. Omar Alderete was either caught in possession or gave the ball away three times in the opening ten minutes, each instance leading to a slick Brentford counter-attack through the equally impressive Kevin Schade and Igor Thiago, which the Sunderland defence and Robin Roefs stood up well to.\n\nSunderland fought well and looked a little less lethargic than in the first half down at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday, but in truth, created little. The best chances of the half fell to Ballard and Alderete, both coming close to getting on the end of crosses resulting from set-piece situations. We only created one chance through open play as Brian Brobbey forced his way past Kristoffer Ajer and struck a shot wide across goal from the right-hand side of the penalty area, and our only shot on goal in the half was Granit Xhaka’s long-range free kick.\n\nThe key difference between the two came from the impressive Thiago. Nordi Mukiele was dispossessed perhaps too easily in midfield, and Thiago immediately set off behind our defensive line. Ballard and Aalderete stepped up to play the offside trap, but Hume delayed and played the Brazilian onside. Thiago cleverly rounded Roefs and slotted the ball home.\n\nSunderland responded well in the second half, outplaying and out-battling Brentford for the first 15 minutes. Brobbey – who won most of his individual duels in the first half but was too isolated to take advantage – had willing runners around him. Enzo Le Fee shot over from the edge of the box, Romaine Mundle (who was an early second-half replacement for Simon Adingra, with Mayenda also replacing Rigg) dragged a shot wide from a promising counter, and Alderete headed over unmarked at the front post from a wicked Xhaka free kick.\n\nThen, the turning point. Excellent work from Mayenda and Brobbey led to the latter being taken down by Ajer, with Brobbey again showcasing his just unnatural upper-body strength. Le Fee stepped up. He’s got a 100% record this season from the spot and has already put one past Kelleher. Yet, for some reason, he decided to try a panenka. Kelleher has saved 7 of 12 penalties faced in his career, and his strength lies in using his acrobatic dive to reach the ball by moving only after the ball is kicked. Le Fee’s panenka was doomed to fail against this keeper, who naturally just stood tall and easily claimed the ball. In fact, Kelleher has the highest save percentage (67%) of all keepers who have faced five or more penalties in Premier League history.\n\nAt that point, the game stood on a knife-edge. Get the goal, get back level, and we can sit and soak. Brentford are supremely impressive on the counter, but could they break us down when we sit deep? We’ll never know. In the second half, they were imperious out wide as we looked more and more like a team stretched and struggling. We’ve played 4 games in 10 days without 6 players to AFCON, with Ballard and Wilson Isisdor injured during this period, and players featuring in the second half today who likely won’t even make the bench in ten days against Palace. It felt like a game too far after some very difficult fixtures and energy-sapping backs-against-the-wall defensive performances.\n\nHume struggled to contain Keane Lewis-Potter and Michael Kayode on the counter; Schade pinned back Mukiele, Ballard had one of his physically most difficult tests of the season against Thiago, Alderete found a red and white shirt too often (but we played in blue), and both wingers couldn’t beat a man in the first half. We looked outmatched physically and stretched on the counter. Regis’ early subs helped, but from the moment the penalty was missed, the game felt like it was gone, and you could’ve bet there, and then they would go up the other end and score straight away. More subs helped inject energy into the players’ flagging energy levels, and Brentford scored a third.\n\nI don’t want to dwell on the second-half goals; they were pretty depressing at the time and even more so now, writing this – as you can probably imagine. I also don’t want to take any credit away from Brentford – they were excellent on the night and have the fourth-best home record in the league for a reason.\n\nWe’ve faltered slightly of late. It is now only 2 wins in 12, and AFCON has taken its toll. It has been a rough period of difficult fixtures that we all feared in the summer when the fixture list was announced. But we are now through it, and we all knew how difficult this would be. Easier games, returning players, and potential incomings in the transfer window are on the horizon. I have to discuss the game, and it was poor, but I don’t want to single players out. I want to applaud that we have only lost 3 in 14, that 21 games in, we still sit in the top 10. We haven’t dropped out of that top 10 all season long – only Arsenal and Man City can say the same. Yes, Le Fee’s penalty was the turning point. But he has also been on fire recently with some incredible performances and has our joint-most combined goals and assists this season. Wilson Isidor suffered similarly at Burnley last season, and he got through it with our support; Enzo needs us now.\n\nLet’s use this weekend to rest some players who have fought ‘Til the End for every point in the last six weeks. Those who have stood tall and only suffered one loss in five without our lads at AFCON, when everyone outside of Sunlun wrote us off and expected the wheels to totally fall off with successive defeats. If this represents the nadir of the season, then it’s been one hell of a season so far.",

We could see quite early on that Sunderland were being given much more time on the ball compared to the Spurs game.\n\nIn the first ten minutes it did seem like we were slightly lackadaisical at times with our passing from defence and midfield, leading to some quick breaks. Thankfully Brentford were not able to take advantage. With so many games in such a short space of time – and with so many of our first team missing – it’s natural that more mistakes would creep in as tiredness and fatigue hit.\n\nAfter the first ten minutes you could see visible improvements as we ramped up the pressure on Brentford with a high press. One common thread in the analysis of our games has been praising the press and how well drilled the team are. This was no different in the first half and start of the second, with mistakes starting to be made in more advanced areas from our opposition. There were also some early signs that our long throw-ins from Mukiele were causing confusion – one in particular where Kelleher was fortunate to get a free-kick for dropping the ball…\n\nWatching Brian Brobbey lead the line, you can’t help but be impressed by the strength and determination that he demonstrates. His hold-up play is superb, along with the intelligence of the runs that he provides. It was a shame that we didn’t take advantage of these runs and the opportunities they present.\n\nThe only thing that is particularly frustrating to see is the lack of protection that he gets from referees and officials. We keep seeing instances where centre-backs are climbing all over Brobbey and clearly committing fouls, but we don’t get the decision as he doesn’t fall to the floor. It’s embarrassing to think that we need to either tell Brobbey to pretend to be more impacted in order to get decisions in his favour or rely upon blatantly obvious fouls to occur, such as the penalty incident.\n\nI don’t have many words to express what we witnessed with that penalty. It was simply a truly awful, baffling decision that should never have been made when we were in a losing position. We all know what it led to, and you can only hope that it’s something that the team learns from.\n\nDespite this though, knee-jerk reactions like those demanding that Le Fée was taken off immediately are hardly helpful. Taking off your most creative player when 1-0 down is not going to help our cause, regardless of how annoying the decision itself was.\n\nWhilst Brobbey was making some excellent runs and holding the ball up well, there was a lack of support evident from midfield. It seemed that Régis Le Bris was suitably unimpressed with our wing play, making changes just after the 50-minute mark. Although there are some encouraging signs of a partnership forming between Mayenda and Brobbey, I am left feeling that some players haven’t really taken advantage of the chances that AFCON has provided.\n\nRomaine Mundle snatched at some chances that at this level have to be taken advantage of. Likewise we’ve seen inconsistent performances from Simon Adingra which have helped demonstrate why he hasn’t been a regular starter despite his potential.\n\nFrom a defensive standpoint we have often debated on who the best back four would be. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Trai Hume dropped for the next game, with the ideal defence consisting of Mukiele, Ballard, Alderete (though he had a shocker today), and Reinildo.\n\nThe FA Cup game comes at a really interesting point in the season. For me it’s a chance for players to get some much-needed rest and for us to prepare for the next Premier League game. It’s also a perfect opportunity for our AFCON contingent to start returning from the tournament and get back into the swing of things.\n\nAs much as I, like many others, would love to see a successful cup run, I can’t help but feel that this would be something better suited to next season. For now the focus should be on simply trying to finish in the highest position possible in the league table and taking advantage of the fantastic start that we have had.\n\nFinally, I think it’s always worth ending with some perspective. Yes, the performance was poor. Yes, the penalty resembled something that you see from those horrendous TikTok streamers on FIFA, but ultimately we’re on 30 points with 21 games played. One thing we’ve always seen is how Régis Le Bris and the team have learned from bad experiences, and this should be no different.",

Chelsea down to 8th in the league.\n\nBehdad Eghbali in the stands at Fulham.\n\nNizaar Kinsella of The BBC writes:\n\n“Chelsea have won just one of their past nine league games and two of 11 in all competitions, falling from potential title contenders in November to a side now lagging far behind.\n\n“They have ground to make up to achieve their minimum aim this season – qualifying for the Champions League, which should be achievable with a top-five finish.”\n\nI think if anything, this is playing it all down a bit. That is a very gloomy looking task for Rosenior, and he only has half a season to do it.

    "fullText": "Fifth Ashes Test, Sydney Cricket Ground (day five of five)\n\nEngland 384: Root 160; Neser 4-60 & 342: Bethell 154; Webster 3-64, Starc 3-72\n\nAustralia 567: Head 163, Smith 138; Tongue 3-97 & 161-5: Labuschagne 37, Tongue 3-42\n\nAustralia won by five wickets, won the series 4-1\n\nEngland's atrocious Ashes tour ended with a five-wicket defeat in the fifth Test that gave Australia a 4-1 series triumph.\n\nAustralia chased a target of 160 after lunch on the final day in the sunshine of the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n\nDisrupted by injuries, including to captain Pat Cummins, Australia dominated yet another Ashes on home soil - this was their fourth consecutive series win down under - and extended a hold of the urn that began in 2018.\n\nFor England, this was the conclusion of one of their most disappointing Ashes tours in recent memory.\n\nIn what was billed as a golden chance to at least compete in this country, the tourists never recovered from an astonishing implosion to lose the first Test in Perth in two days.\n\nHampered by a lack of adequate preparation, scrutinised for their off-field activities, then hit by a loss of form and injuries to key players, England surrendered the series at the earliest opportunity with defeats in the first three Tests.\n\nBen Stokes' side at least took the fourth Test in Melbourne for their first Test win in this country since 2011, but that two-day shootout on a grassy pitch was the outlier in a series where they were humbled.\n\nStokes was able to lead his team onto the field for the final act in Sydney despite a groin injury. The all-rounder has said he wants to carry on as captain and fitness would appear to be the only barrier to him remaining in charge.\n\nGreater pressure is on head coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key. Both men have admitted failings on this tour and expressed their desire to stay.\n\nThey look set to be given the opportunity if they can demonstrate to the management of the England and Wales Cricket Board that the set-up of the men's national team has improved.\n\nThat begins with the T20 World Cup and a preceding white-ball tour of Sri Lanka, which starts in just two weeks' time.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nEngland futures at risk but Head an all-format star - Ashes player ratings\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nThis was supposed to be the crowing glory of the Bazball project, a series England had been building towards for 18 months and which McCullum said could \"define\" his team.\n\nUltimately, they were defined as another England outfit trounced in Australia. This was the fourth successive Ashes tour where England have lost at least four Tests.\n\nThis century alone, England's record in this country is 27 defeats from 35 matches. Three of their five Test wins in that period came in the glorious triumph of 2010-11 - the only series England have won here in the past 40 years.\n\nPlayers England backed for this tour have wilted. Ollie Pope played three Tests before being dropped, the previously successful opening partnership of Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett collapsed, and wicketkeeper Jamie Smith was a shadow of his best.\n\nSpinner Shoaib Bashir, earmarked for this tour more than a year ago, did not play a Test.\n\nAs ever on Ashes tours, England were struck by injuries. Mark Wood may not play for England again after going home with a knee problem and Jofra Archer's impressive tour was ended by a side strain sustained in the third Test. Gus Atkinson was ruled out of Sydney with a hamstring problem.\n\nPace bowler Josh Tongue emerged with his reputation enhanced, while Jacob Bethell's coming-of-age century in the final Test was a belated silver lining. If only England had backed Bethell months ago.\n\nJoe Root provided England's best moment of the tour by finally scoring a Test hundred in Australia, but this was another Ashes tour where Root and Stokes - two England greats - were on the wrong end of a hammering. Root may get another opportunity in four years, Stokes almost certainly will not.\n\nStokes has backed McCullum, who has also been publicly supported by Key. While this management are not alone in presiding over failed England Ashes tours, much of the scrutiny comes from issues and problems that could have been avoided.\n\nEngland chose a squad that left them few options when things went wrong and prepared their players in conditions far removed from what they encountered in the Tests.\n\nAs well as being ill-equipped for the challenges they faced on the field, the visitors seemed surprised by the hostile attention they received from the Australian media, particularly at the beginning of the tour.\n\nIn Perth, England players were followed to golf courses and even an aquarium. In Brisbane they were pictured riding escooters without helmets, an offence punishable by a fine under Queensland law. As they prepared to fly from Brisbane airport, a member of the England security staff was involved in altercation with a TV cameraman.\n\nThe Brisbane flight came at the end of England's infamous holiday in Noosa, where the amount of time some players spent drinking was investigated by Key. Images of England players on the beach and in bars will be just as abiding as anything that happened on the field.\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\n'Areas to improve' but McCullum 'won't be told what to do'\n\nThe Ashes: Aussies beat England by five wickets in final Test - reaction\n\nFrom 302-8 overnight, 119 ahead, England's hope of pressurising Australia rested with Bethell, unbeaten on 142 after his stunning debut century on Wednesday.\n\nAustralia took the second new ball five overs into the day, Bethell overturned being given lbw to Scott Boland, only to be cramped into an edge off Mitchell Starc. The brilliant Starc then enticed last man Tongue into a pat to extra cover.\n\nIn the quest for the wickets that would discomfort Australia's chase, England were incensed when Jake Weatherald survived an appeal for caught behind off Brydon Carse - a final Snicko controversy of the tour.\n\nGiven not out on the field, Weatherald was also reprieved on review by TV umpire Chris Gaffaney, despite small movement on the Snicko technology. Carse had to be moved away from on-field umpire Ahsan Raza, who Stokes then spoke to about \"consistency\".\n\nWeatherald was on 16 and moved to 34 before being bounced out by Tongue, who also had Head hole out into the leg side for 29. England ignored Matthew Potts, Bethell bowled first change and Will Jacks produced a ripping off-break to bowl Steve Smith just after lunch.\n\nUsman Khawaja, in his 88th and final Test, had earlier led Australia out to field and was given a guard of honour by England when he came out to bat. Khawaja made only six before chopping on off Tongue, departing to a rapturous ovation and performing a sajdah in front of the pavilion.\n\nThere was a final England drop - their 18th of the series - when Bethell shelled Marnus Labuschagne at gully off Tongue. Labuschagne was run out for 37 in a mix-up with Alex Carey.\n\nThe hint of farce continued when both Carey and Cameron Green almost ended up at the same end, only for both to survive the run-out chance.\n\nIt was end-of-term stuff. The Barmy Army went through their songbook, Carey hit the winning runs and the Ashes series was over.\n\nWhilst England have been awful, Australia have yet again found a way to win a home Ashes series at a canter.\n\nThey have done so with captain Cummins playing only one Test because of a back injury, fellow seamer Josh Hazlewood not playing at all and leading spinner Nathan Lyon limited to a bit-part role by conditions and an injury of his own.\n\nAs such, Australia have once again got their hands on the urn with a second-choice or even third-choice bowling attack.\n\nLeft-arm seamer Starc has been devastating for his 31 wickets, Head's promotion to open in Perth was a defining moment in the series and Carey has been magnificent behind the stumps.\n\nRealistically, there are not many more players in the home side who can say they were consistently at their best, further highlighting what a waste this was from England.\n\nCuriously, the Ashes winners still have a number of questions to answer as they build towards the next series against England in 2027 - the identity of an opener, number three, all-rounder and frontline spinner could all come for debate.\n\nAustralia will search for these answers as they look for the formula to secure a first away Ashes win since 2001. That contest is barely 18 months away. No doubt the hype will soon commence.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "England's 4-1 Ashes defeat is the most disappointing I have covered and whoever signed off on the tourists' preparation has to go, writes Jonathan Agnew.",
    "fullText": "This has been my 10th tour covering England in Australia and has been, quite comfortably, the most disappointing.\n\nRecord numbers of people have come to watch, which illustrates the massive interest there has been.\n\nEveryone, me included, thought this would be a hard-fought series that would go down to the wire.\n\nRather than it being a series to remember, this has been a real let down and it ends, like so many tours before, with the English team and game under the microscope.\n\nEngland effectively faced an Australia second XI throughout, won four of the five tosses and they blew it - a 4-1 series defeat confirmed by the fifth Test loss in Sydney.\n\nYou do not have to look far for answers. England coach Brendon McCullum has already admitted it.\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win\n\nEngland futures at risk but Head an all-format star - Ashes player ratings\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nForget the batting in Perth or bowling in Adelaide, I go back to 24 July 2025 as the moment England lost this series.\n\nI remember how furious I was that day - the day pre-series preparations of nets and one intra-squad warm-up were announced - because we all knew England's plans were not sufficient to win an Ashes series here.\n\nIt beggars belief it was signed off by those at the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). Whoever did so, whether director of cricket Rob Key, chief executive Richard Gould or someone else, should lose their job.\n\nSelfishly, you never know how many more of these tours you are going to work on. That is why I was furious but also upset.\n\nBut thousands of England fans, who I have spent most evenings talking to, have invested their life savings in coming out here.\n\nTheir feeling is not disappointment. They are angry and deserve better.\n\nWith the soft dismissals and dropped catches, they have watched a team that is so ill-disciplined it is embarrassing.\n\nCompare that to Australia, who catch everything, give you nothing with the ball and go on and get big individual scores.\n\nThe ECB now owes it to England's supporters to come up with some explanations.\n\nIt seems McCullum is going to be given the opportunity to turn things around, assuming he agrees to change his ways. I just do not think that is likely to happen.\n\nHe played and captained this way with New Zealand. He coaches and lives his life in this relaxed manner.\n\nMcCullum is very good company, a decent man who did good work in those early years in charge, but it has been shown that his methods do not work with this set of players in Test cricket.\n\nBazball has not been good for Ollie Pope, Harry Brook, Jamie Smith or Gus Atkinson to name a few. They have been a bit scrambled by what is expected of them.\n\nThere needs to be much more flexibility around playing more games of cricket and a greater emphasis on county cricket, where players learn their game.\n\nDoes McCullum even believe that is the way to go?\n\n'Areas to improve' but McCullum 'won't be told what to do'\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nWhatever happens there, the one England must keep in place is Ben Stokes as captain.\n\nThey cannot afford for McCullum to go and Stokes to follow suit.\n\nYes, he has been as much part of the mantra as McCullum, but his comments in this series have shown he wants more.\n\nI do not think he has had a great series as captain.\n\nWhy Josh Tongue was not given the new ball sooner than the final day of the series I do not know and some of Stokes' fielding positions or tactical decisions have been off.\n\nBut he is the best leader England have. Certainly Brook, Stokes' vice-captain, has shown he is a million miles from being suitable to lead England's Test team.\n\nBrook batted irresponsibly from the start, has not learned and now needs to really go away and look at his game.\n\nIf he does not, he will fall well short of what he is capable of, which would be a real waste.\n\nWhen it comes to the other changes, I hope we have not seen the last of Pope because he is a talented batsman.\n\nEngland have to move on from Will Jacks, who is not a good enough bowler to be the sole spinner in a Test attack.\n\nThe real interesting one is wicketkeeper Smith. Who will be behind the stumps for England's first Test next summer?\n\nThe way Smith has shrivelled here, with 211 runs across 10 innings at an average of 23.44, as well as dropped catches, is a matter of serious concern.\n\nIn truth, the only players who can leave the tour with their heads held high are Tongue and Jacob Bethell.\n\nBrydon Carse was given the wrong role - he is someone who comes on first change and runs in hard while bowling long spells rather than an opening bowler - but deserves credit for the way he continued to charge in throughout five Tests.\n\nBethell's 154 in Sydney was an innings of someone who has played 50 Tests rather than five.\n\nBrook should take a leaf out of his book when trying to work out how to play proper Test innings.\n\nAfter a tour that began with so much hope, there is very little to cheer.\n\nJonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Matthew Henry",

    "fullText": "Coach Brendon McCullum says he will not be told what to do but accepted there are \"areas to improve\" after England's Ashes defeat.\n\nAustralia's five-wicket victory in the fifth Test confirmed England's 4-1 series defeat - a result that has brought the futures of McCullum, captain Ben Stokes and director Rob Key into question.\n\nThe management of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), who said a review into the defeat is under way, are minded to allow McCullum and Key to continue but they must accept and enact change.\n\n\"I am not against assistance but have a firm belief in how to get the best out of these players,\" McCullum, 44, told BBC Test Match Special.\n\n\"I will look at it individually and say 'what could I have done better?'\n\n\"Am I for being told what to do? Of course I am not. But at the same time I'm not thinking there won't be areas to improve.\"\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win\n\nEngland futures at risk but Head an all-format star - player ratings\n\nIn an attempt to rid players of pressure, a relaxed environment has been a cornerstone of McCullum's England since he took over as Test coach at the start of 2022.\n\nBut on this tour, which began with a genuine feeling England could be competitive, England have appeared unserious with questions being raised about their preparation, training methods and an apparent lack of accountability for mistakes made on the field.\n\nTheir time playing golf and the amount of drinking on a mid-series trip to Noosa has also come into focus.\n\nMcCullum said: \"When I took the job on I remember the situation England were in.\n\n\"I felt it was a great opportunity to use the resource, talent, support base and history that sits in English cricket to ensure the Test side, while there are challenges which are hitting the game all around the world with franchise cricket etc, are still able to get the best players possible who can get excited to come on tour.\n\n\"Over the last three and a half years with Stokesy and myself, our record is what it is.\n\n\"It has certainly improved from what it was. Whether it is at the levels we all want, probably not, but it doesn't mean we can't get there.\"\n\nECB chief executive Richard Gould, who has been in Australia in recent weeks, said a \"thorough review\" is \"already under way\".\n\n\"This will cover tour planning and preparation, individual performance and behaviours, and our ability to adapt and respond effectively as circumstances require,\" he said.\n\n\"We will implement the necessary changes over the coming months.\"\n\nWhile McCullum and Stokes remained forthright in a wish to carry on, Stokes said it was time for \"honest truths\" about the side.\n\n\"We started so well in the first couple of years and now we are eking downwards,\" he added.\n\n\"That is never a good place to be as a team. The time off after this is for reflection and honest truths. It needs to happen.\"\n\nStokes, whose side have only won three of their past 10 Tests and lost 11 of their past 15 away from home, suggested opposition have found them out.\n\n\"For a while, teams are working out how to operate against us as a team,\" he told TNT Sports.\n\n\"When we seem to get into a situation with the bat where everything looks easy, oppositions are doing a lot of the same things to us now. We need to work out what we do in those situations a lot better.\n\n\"We play too much 'three out of 10 cricket' in terms of the chances of it coming off. When you do that, the chances are it is not going to come off in your favour.\"\n\nThe pair won 10 of their first 11 matches in charge, having taken over following a run of one victory in 17 Tests.\n\nDespite that upturn, they have failed to win any of their major series.\n\nThey drew the 2023 home Ashes and last summer's series against India 2-2, and lost 4-1 in India in 2024.\n\nThey lost this series at the earliest opportunity with defeats in the first three Tests.\n\n\"I am obviously disappointed with the outcome of the series,\" McCullum said. \"As coach you have to put your hand up.\n\n\"There are things we have got to look at over the next little while. I would love to carry on because I feel we have got steps to take, things to improve on.\n\n\"I feel like we have got the makings of a good cricket team.

    "description": "Discovery shows that weapons containing toxic substances from plants were used in modern-day South Africa far earlier than previously thought",
    "fullText": "The use of biological weapons dates back at least 60,000 years, scientists have found, uncovering the oldest ever evidence of poison-tipped arrows.\n\nWhen Stone Age hunters stalked across modern-day South Africa, they were not only armed with bows and arrows but also an extra ingredient to make sure they brought down their prey.\n\nTheir arrow tips had been coated with chemicals extracted from the plant known as gifbol, or Boophone disticha. It contains toxic substances including buphandrin and epibuphanisine that can lead to agitation, stupor and death.\n\n• Rare battle treasures discovered from the age of Boudica\n\nThe plant, known locally as Bushman poison bulb, is still in use by traditional hunters who extract its milky sap and make it into a paste to apply to their arrows. For larger animals such as the eland, a type of antelope, the poison can take hours or days to take effect.\n\nResearchers from South Africa and Sweden said: “Wounded animals usually continue to run for several kilometres during which hunters will track them, sometimes for a day or more.” In lower doses, it has medicinal uses.\n\nArchaeologists have now discovered that the plant’s use by hunters as a poison to apply to arrowheads dates back at least 60 millennia. Professor Marlize Lombard, of the Palaeo-Research Institute at the University of Johannesburg, said: “This is the oldest direct evidence that humans used arrow poison.”\n\nThe study, published in the Science Advances journal, said it was the first firm evidence found of poisoned arrow use in the Pleistocene epoch, which lasted from 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago. Evidence of poison-tipped arrows had previously been found from 6,700 years ago and signs of a “poison applicator” were found dating back 24,000 years, but there is debate over that find.\n\n• Think things are bad? Look at how our ancestors treated each other\n\n“It shows that our ancestors in southern Africa not only invented the bow and arrow much earlier than previously thought, but also understood how to use nature’s chemistry to increase hunting efficiency,” Lombard said.\n\nThe substance was identified on 60,000-year-old quartz arrowheads found in the Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.\n\nProfessor Sven Isaksson of the Archaeological Research Laboratory at Stockholm University said: “Being able to identify the world’s oldest arrow poison together has been a complex undertaking and is incredibly encouraging for continued research.”\n\nThe discovery also provides evidence that early humans in the region were capable of the complex thought processes needed to plan, extract, mix and apply poison to their weapons.\n\n• Stone Age or Picasso — can you spot the difference?\n\nProfessor Anders Högberg from the Department of Cultural Sciences at Linnaeus University in Sweden said: “Using arrow poison requires planning, patience and an understanding of cause and effect. It is a clear sign of advanced thinking in early humans.”\n\nThe toxin was also found on arrowheads collected by travellers dating from the 18th century, showing it is likely to have been in constant use over a long period of time.\n\nIsaksson said: “Finding traces of the same poison on both prehistoric and historical arrowheads was crucial. By carefully studying the chemical structure of the substances and thus drawing conclusions about their properties, we were able to determine that these particular substances are stable enough to survive this long in the ground.\n\n“It’s also fascinating that people had such a deep and long-standing understanding of the use of plants.”",

    "fullText": "COVID-19 does not just affect the respiratory system, but also significantly alters the brain in people who have fully recovered from the infectious disease, highlighting the long-term neurological impact of the virus.\n\nResearchers from Griffith University’s National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Disease (NCNED) used advanced MRI techniques to ascertain the neurological implications of COVID-19 compared with those who had never been infected.\n\nThe research provided compelling evidence that even in the absence of ongoing symptoms, prior infection with the virus could leave a measurable imprint on the brain.\n\nLead author, Dr Kiran Thapaliya, said: “We used multimodal MRI techniques to examine both grey and white matter brain regions critical for memory, cognition and overall brain health and found clear differences across all participant groups.”\n\n“The unique MRI approach identified significant alterations in brain neurochemicals, brain signal intensity, and tissue structure not only in individuals with Long COVID but also in those who considered themselves fully recovered,” he said.\n\n“The research also reported that altered brain tissue was associated with symptom severity in individuals with Long COVID, suggesting the virus may leave a silent, lasting effect on brain health.”\n\nThese findings offer vital insights into how COVID 19 affects the central nervous system and may help explain the cognitive problems, such as memory and concentration, reported both shortly after infection and months or even years later.\n\nNCNED Director, Professor Sonya Marshall-Gradisnik, said: “The NCNED brings together a critical mass of talented researchers and clinicians committed to improving the lives of the patients.”\n\n“We are privileged to access state-of-the-art technologies which drive transformative scientific discoveries.”\n\nThe research was funded by ME Research UK and the Stafford Fox Medical Research Foundation.\n\nThe paper ‘Altered Brain Tissue Microstructure and Neurochemical Profiles in Long COVID and Recovered COVID-19 Individuals: A multimodal MRI Study’ was published in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity – Health.",

    "description": "Ford announced plans to deploy eyes-off driving technology on public roads by 2028. The legacy automaker is making the tech in-house to get there.",
    "fullText": "Ford said it's developing autonomous capabilities, such as eyes-off driving, that will be ready for public roads by 2028.\n\nThe legacy automaker said in an announcement on Wednesday that it will be cheaper to develop self-driving technology in-house than to seek an outside supplier.\n\n\"Because we own the technology behind our driver assistance systems, we can deliver significantly more capability at a 30% lower cost than if we bought it from outside suppliers, which makes advanced driver assistance scalable,\" Ford announced during CES in Las Vegas.\n\nChris Morse, a spokesperson for Ford, told Business Insider that the cost is compared to \"the supplier system that we have on-road today.\" A specific supplier was not named.\n\nKey team members behind Ford's ADAS ambitions gave Business Insider a broad overview of some of the advantages of an in-house approach.\n\nSammy Omari, head of ADAS and infotainment at Ford Motor Company, said the company can have greater oversight over how the sensors are utilized and integrated into the vehicles.\n\n\"How can we now combine the information from all these sensors in the most cost-effective way to get to the highest performance?\" he said. \"These are some of the key reasons why we can get to that price point.\"\n\nPaul Costa, a former Apple employee who now leads Ford's electrical engineering team, told Business Insider that the company can reduce the number of separate computer modules inside its vehicles — an ADAS computer, an infotainment system, an audio system, and a networking computer — into one computer without having to compromise performance.\n\nCosta said Ford has \"great suppliers,\" but seeking third parties doesn't allow for integration of modules, and the size of the computers themselves is larger.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" he said. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nThere are several players in the business of licensing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for car makers, including Nvidia, Waymo, and Wayve, among others. Ford previously announced a partnership with Mobileye in 2020 to develop its ADAS software, called BlueCruise.\n\nA spokesperson for Mobileye declined to comment.\n\nLeading EV companies in the US — namely Tesla and Rivian — have taken an in-house approach to developing their own self-driving technology. Rivian announced earlier in December that it designed its own silicon chip to power the autonomous driving computer inside its future vehicles.\n\nCosta told Business Insider that Ford isn't interested in making its own chip and the automaker is happy with its current suppliers.\n\n\"We're not interested in a TOPS war,\" Costa said, referring to a metric chipmakers commonly like to tout.\n\n\"Honestly, I don't want custom silicon,\" he later added. \"If I can get other people's volume on silicon that I need, that is good for democratization.\"",

    "fullText": "Some CEOs are showing up to meetings with a working prototype and saying, \"Look what I built,\" says Replit chief executive Amjad Masad.\n\nThe CEO of the AI coding startup said on an episode of the \"Possible\" podcast published Wednesday that vibe coding is giving executives a new kind of agency.\n\nMasad said many leaders feel \"disempowered because they've delegated a lot of things.\"\n\n\"They don't have as much input on the process,\" he added.\n\nThat dynamic is changing as CEOs start using vibe coding tools to prototype their ideas.\n\n\"We have CEOs that finally feel unleashed,\" Masad said. \"They don't have to go beg someone to do it. They can, like, just vibe code and bring it into a meeting,\" he added.\n\nA rough prototype, Masad said, allows leaders to ask a pointed question: Why should this take weeks to build if a version can be done in a few days?\n\nMasad said much of coding is weighed down by \"minutiae\" and \"accidental complexity\" — technical details that matter to machines but add little value to the people shaping products or strategy.\n\n\"We want to get to a point where you don't have to code at all. You should be in a creative space,\" he said.\n\nThat's also why some of the most effective users of AI coding tools aren't engineers. Masad said product managers, who are trained to break problems into clear steps and communicate them precisely, are \"some of the best vibe coders.\"\n\nSome tech CEOs have been vocal about using AI coding tools to test ideas faster and work more efficiently.\n\nKlarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said on an episode of the \"Sourcery\" podcast published in September that he uses AI coding tools like Cursor to prototype ideas on his own and save employees time.\n\n\"I was a business person, and then I just started exploring Cursor,\" said Siemiatkowski, who does not come from a technical background.\n\n\"Rather than disturbing my poor engineers and product people with what is half good ideas and half bad ideas, now I test it myself,\" he said. \"I come say, 'Look, I've actually made this work, this is how it works, what do you think, could we do it this way?'\"\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in June at Bloomberg Tech in San Francisco that he has been vibe coding.\n\n\"I've just been messing around — either with Cursor or I vibe coded with Replit — trying to build a custom webpage with all the sources of information I wanted in one place. I could type a location and get it all,\" Pichai said.\n\n\"It feels so delightful to be a coder in this moment,\" he added.",

    "description": "A Ukrainian F-16 pilot said the initial tactics taught by NATO were based on wars that were \"fundamentally different\" from Ukraine's fight.",
    "fullText": "One of Ukraine's first F-16 pilots said they had to create new tactics for the fighter because the West's original training didn't fit the war against Russia.\n\nUkraine's air force released a video interview on Monday with the pilot, whose name wasn't disclosed, in which he spoke about the F-16 Fighting Falcon's performance and the early challenges he faced when learning to fly the aircraft.\n\nThe pilot said he flew Kyiv's Soviet-made combat aircraft in the initial days of Russia's full-scale invasion, before being sent abroad to train to fly the F-16s donated by the West.\n\nOnce he returned to the war, he and his fellow pilots \"encountered reality,\" he said.\n\n\"The tactics that we were taught abroad do not entirely fit the war we have here, because those tactics are also based on wars in which the partners previously took part,\" the pilot said. \"And this war is fundamentally different from those wars.\"\n\nUkrainian pilots had to devise their own tactics, he said.\n\n\"How we would destroy cruise missiles, strike drones, how we would fight with the enemy near the line of combat contact,\" the pilot added.\n\nUkraine's Western allies have been taking note of some of those lessons, he added.\n\n\"When the partners see our effectiveness, they understand how, in our limited conditions, we are able to carry out flights with such effectiveness,\" he said. \"And they even, I would say, learn from us. They learn the tactics and adjust the tactics that they taught us when we were abroad.\"\n\nThe pilot didn't go into exact detail about the types of new tactics Ukrainians developed for the F-16, but spoke about a daring maneuver he recently conducted in the Donbas region.\n\nHe said his three-ship formation had encountered heavily saturated Russian defenses, including surface-to-air missile systems and unspecified air assets, that \"did not allow us the possibility to approach\" their target.\n\n\"We drew two missiles from the enemy, because there were two launches from different directions, and we gave the opportunity for our strike aircraft to destroy the target,\" he said.\n\nThe pilot said the entire group returned safely after the mission.\n\nUkraine has officially received 44 of the 87 F-16s that European nations have promised to donate to Kyiv. Its first crews for the American-made aircraft were trained in Romania, where a coalition of NATO member states, including the US, worked to teach Ukrainian pilots, technicians, and other staff to service and fly the planes.\n\nIn his interview, the pilot said the language barrier was one of his biggest challenges when learning to fly the F-16, and that while waiting to be sent abroad for training, he studied English grammar, colloquial language, and aviation terms as he rested between combat flights.\n\n\"It was very hard, because after a combat sortie, as a rule, a pilot has to rest, because he does not know whether at some moment he might fly again,\" he said.\n\nThe first of Ukraine's F-16s entered the war in August 2024 and were primarily used for defensive purposes against strike drones and cruise missiles.\n\nKyiv has since lost four of the aircraft, but its pilots have also been recorded achieving notable feats, including one reportedly destroying six missiles in a single flight.\n\nThe interviewed pilot praised the F-16 as a fighter that performs \"flawlessly,\" but also said he wished for the more advanced, Block 70/72 version of the aircraft. These latest iterations have been upgraded with fifth-generation technology, including powerful radars with stronger jamming resistance and a modernized cockpit.\n\n\"If we were given such an opportunity to carry out tasks on these aircraft, I think that in our tally there would be not only destroyed strike drones and cruise missiles, but also enemy aircraft that are carrying out tasks along the line of combat contact,\" he said.",

    "description": "The NC-13 strike company's commander told Business Insider that the drone's primary objective was to suppress Russian troops from advancing for weeks.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian commander said his troops used a single remote-controlled vehicle with a machine gun to hold frontline areas for nearly six straight weeks.\n\nDetails about the 45-day combat mission were provided exclusively to Business Insider by the NC-13 Strike Company, a unit within Ukraine's Third Army Corps that specializes in uncrewed ground vehicles, or UGVs.\n\n\"Only the UGV system was present at the position,\" said NC-13's commander, Mykola \"Makar\" Zinkevych. \"This was the core concept — robots do not bleed.\"\n\nA lone ground drone deployed so extensively signals both how quickly the technology is evolving in Ukraine and how Kyiv may soon look to deploy such vehicles at scale in combat. UGVs, although still seeing limited use compared to flying attack drones, are gaining popularity for their potential to replace human soldiers in holding frontline areas, which is one of the war's most dangerous tasks.\n\nThe gun-wielding drone used by Zinkevych's troops was the Droid TW 12.7, developed by the Ukrainian company DevDroid. It is a remote-controlled tracked buggy equipped with a .50-caliber M2 Browning.\n\nZinkevych said the Droid TW 12.7 was deployed to multiple positions during its 45-day combat duty, each time at the request of a command and observation post in the local fighting area.\n\n\"Requests were received regularly,\" the commander said.\n\nThe drone's primary objective was to \"deliver fire damage and fire suppression against the enemy,\" to discourage Russian troops from trying to advance in areas held by Ukraine, said Zinkevych.\n\nThe Droid TW 12.7 would briefly leave its post every two days to be serviced, Zinkevych said, by a Ukrainian drone crew sheltering about 4 kilometers, or 2.4 miles, away from the line of contact.\n\nAccording to the commander, technical maintenance took about four hours each time, including weapons servicing, restocking the drone's ammo, and recharging its battery.\n\n\"To speed up the inspection process, over time we purchased additional battery packs at our own expense, which reduced the maintenance time to 2 hours,\" Zinkevych said. Ukrainian troops regularly spend their own salaries or savings on matériel.\n\nDevDroid says that its Droid TW 12.7 has an operational range of up to 15 miles and is controlled via a radio signal, but that the drone can use artificial intelligence to set its own course automatically. The extent to which it can autonomously navigate the battlefield and engage in combat is still unclear.\n\nThe Third Army Corps posted a video in December of the drone firing at an off-camera target.\n\nTwo versions of the ground drone with grenade launchers — the Mk-19 and AGL-53 40mm — were also approved last month by Ukraine for official military use.\n\nZinkevych said that his company, created in September 2025 under the Third Assault Brigade, is focusing this year on the \"maximum involvement\" and wider-scale use of UGVs in combat for both defensive and assault missions.\n\n\"The demand for these systems is indeed high,\" he said.\n\nBut Zinkevych said the process will be resource-intensive, and that his company runs a crowdfunding effort to continue developing its ground drones for combat.\n\n\"Today, we believe this is the most cost-effective investment,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Matt Damon, 55, says one diet change left him lighter than he has been in years.\n\nDuring an appearance on Wednesday's episode of the \"New Heights\" podcast, Damon spoke about how he prepared for his latest role in \"The Odyssey.\"\n\n\"I was in really good shape. I lost a lot of weight. He said he wanted me like lean but strong. It's a weird thing,\" Damon told hosts Jason and Travis Kelce, referring to the film's director, Christopher Nolan.\n\nTo achieve that physique, Damon said he cut one thing out of his diet.\n\n\"I literally, just because of this other thing I did with my doctor, stopped eating gluten,\" Damon said. \"I used to walk around between 185 and 200. I did that whole movie at 167. And I haven't been that light since high school. So it was a lot of training and a really strict diet.\"\n\nThe actor said he works with a trainer, and compared the physical preparation to how the Kelce siblings would gear up for a football season, with training becoming part of his daily routine.\n\n\"You know, it's like just part of your day. It's part of your job, right? And it's like yeah, you get really routinized about it and really kind of build your day around all that stuff,\" Damon said.\n\nThe actor added that he hasn't had gluten since. \"I'm done. I'm done. I'm gluten-free everything,\" Damon said.\n\nA gluten-free diet eliminates gluten, a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. It is often adopted for medical or digestive reasons, including to manage symptoms of celiac disease.\n\nFor most people, gluten isn't necessarily harmful.\n\n\"Evidence suggests that, for general health, the emphasis should be on a whole, minimally processed, plant-based diet, which can include gluten-containing grains,\" Grace Fjeldberg, a registered dietician with the Mayo Clinic Health System, told Business Insider in 2021.\n\nDespite its popularity, a gluten-free diet doesn't necessarily result in weight loss and isn't a universal approach to better health.\n\nDamon is no stranger to getting into peak shape for a role.\n\nIn a 2016 BBC interview, Damon said that getting back into shape for his return to the Bourne franchise was \"brutal,\" after his last appearance in 2007's \"The Bourne Ultimatum.\"\n\n\"For the first Bourne movie I was 29 and I thought that was hard work getting into shape,\" Damon said.\n\n\"Now I'm 45 and it's just brutal. We shot this bare-knuckle fighting scene on my 45th birthday and it was a lot of work to get there,\" he added.",

    "title": "Unilever's 'underarm sommeliers' sniff out most promising new products",
    "description": "More than 800 research and development staff work to create — and test — personal care products for the consumer goods group",
    "fullText": "It’s not often you are forced to witness someone stroll up to a topless man — hands held high above his head — and take an enormous inhale of his armpit. “A wine sommelier, but of the underarm,” observes Alan Palmer, chief research and development officer of Unilever’s personal care division, as we watch from a few feet away.\n\nWe’re deep in the heart of the consumer goods group’s colossal research and development facility near Liverpool, known as Port Sunlight. It is a maze of laboratories and whacky testing rooms devoted almost entirely to keeping Unilever’s personal care brands — which stretch from Axe (Lynx) and Sure deodorant to Dove soap and the household cleaning product Domestos — ahead of their competitors.\n\nThe so-called underarm sommelier takes a step back to consider her findings before moving on to the next target: a slightly older, scrawnier-looking man who stares ahead nonchalantly as his armpits are assessed in a similar fashion.\n\nShe is, of course, part of a dedicated panel of “odour assessors”, whose responsibility is to test the effectiveness of new roll-on and spray deodorants developed by Unilever. Laugh as you like, but this is day-to-day life at Port Sunlight, where the company’s research and development team is under immense pressure to keep the company’s array of deodorants, shampoo and skincare products one step ahead of rivals such as Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods group.\n\nUnilever spent just shy of €1 billion on research and development across all of its divisions in 2024 and employs roughly 840 people in its personal care division’s R&D team alone. Working closely with the University of Liverpool, it conducts more than 48 “odour assessments” each year at Port Sunlight, which is the equivalent of 5,000 underarms being sniffed 60,000 times, according to internal figures.\n\nElsewhere a “hot room” akin to a sauna is used to collect copious amounts of sweat per year for testing. The company invested £80 million last year in building an in-house fragrance facility at Port Sunlight, where perfumers develop the scents that underpin its body sprays and shampoos.\n\nYet the sheer time and personnel devoted to the mission seems to leave out the question of whether the world actually needs “whole-body deodorant” (Unilever’s latest innovation), or Lynx’s “lower-body spray” (yes, for the nether regions).\n\nWhile the consumer group spent €1 billion on R&D in 2024, it splashed out about €9.4 billion on marketing, according to its annual report. The year-on-year increase alone was about the same as its entire R&D spend and, at 15.5 per cent of group turnover, marketing expenditure was at its highest level in more than a decade.\n\nPalmer, a Unilever lifer who is at the forefront of its research efforts, is obsessive as he hosts a tour of the Port Sunlight facility. “I feel like consumer goods is the equivalent of Formula 1. The minute I lose a race, it’s like, ‘Why?’ The minute I lose two races then I start really worrying and I can’t lose a season,” he says.\n\nProcter & Gamble, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based competitor behind the likes of Olay, Pantene and Head and Shoulders, is a particular concern of his and he recalls the threat posed by its acquisition of Nature, the natural deodorant brand, in 2017. “There was nothing particularly in the science, but the aesthetics and sensory were very good. They had outstanding fragrances, very, very disruptive and didactic packaging. Suddenly they came with a stick pack, one that was completely monolithic white and the brand was on its side,” he recalls.\n\nThe pressure on him is understandable given the wider context at Unilever. The €13.6 billion personal care business is central to the future of the company as Fernando Fernandez, its chief executive, presses ahead with a restructuring and cost-cutting drive that involves stepping back from some of its food brands, which have struggled with shoppers switching to own-label products in recent years.\n\nDiscussions are reported to be under way over a sale of the British heritage brands Marmite, Bovril and Colman’s mustard, while the healthy snacks brand Graze was recently sold to the German confectioner Katjes International. Last month Unilever completed the long-awaited demerger of its ice cream division, the Magnum Ice Cream Company, which was spun off and floated on the Amsterdam, London and New York stock exchanges.\n\nFernandez, who took over from Hein Schumacher in March, has outlined a “premiumisation” strategy, which involves tweaking Unilever’s products to improve value and desirability. Yet shares barely moved last year.\n\nOne big challenge is whether Unilever can demonstrate that its new and improved products are worth paying more for. This will be no mean feat given sluggish consumer confidence across key markets in Europe and the United States and continued macroeconomic headwinds. While investment in R&D gives some pricing power, it doesn’t guarantee sales even if billions are poured into marketing.\n\n“It’s not an easy thing to do to consistently year in, year out, deliver that innovation that justifies the pricing,” Chris Beckett, a consumer staples analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said. “Consumers on both sides of the Atlantic and in China, you’d point to, are not in a wonderful place right now.”\n\nThere are other markets at play, with Brazil one of Sure’s largest; however, “a lot of consumers in markets that matter to Unilever don’t think the cost of living crisis has gone away”, Beckett said. “Convincing that consumer that your product is worth spending more of their disposable income on, that is not easy.”\n\nStill, there are some early signs its strategy is working. Unilever reported better than expected sales in the most recent quarter, with a particularly strong showing for Dove soaps and deodorant in North America suggesting a resilience in consumer spending across the pond.\n\nDeodorants have become one of Unilever’s largest and fastest-growing categories with Sure, known outside the UK as Rexona, the top ranking of the “power brands”. Founded in 1908 by the Australian physician Alice Sheffer, it nets more than €2 billion in turnover each year and is sold in more than 100 countries.\n\n“If you look back at the history [of Rexona], what you will see is that it was always about using superior science to create a high-performing product that puts people in control of the problem they’ve got,” Ben Curtis, global brand vice-president of Sure, says.\n\nPort Sunlight’s latest innovation, “whole-body” deodorants, kicked off with the launch of Sure and Lynx’s first collection in the UK in January last year. The thinking behind it is that armpits account for less than 2 per cent of body sweat, meaning the large majority of body odour comes from elsewhere.\n\nCurtis says deodorant has moved on from “one can that sits in the family bathroom and everyone’s sharing it, which is how I grew up, to people having their own personal expertise of products that they’re using across their whole body”.\n\nYet critics continue to question whether demand for some of its more curious innovations is primarily a product of heavily funded ad campaigns, as opposed to a missing need among consumers.\n\nOne of Fernandez’s first decisions when he arrived at Unilever was to shift half of its ad budget towards social media alongside a twentyfold increase in the use of online “influencers” to push products via Instagram, TikTok and other channels.\n\nThe company reckons “whole-body” will make up 10 to 15 per cent of total value in deodorants over the next few years. If that’s true, the question of whether canny marketing is the real driver is unlikely to bother Unilever.",

    "title": "IBM's AI agent Bob easily duped to run malware, researchers show",
    "description": ": Prompt injection lets risky commands slip past guardrails",
    "fullText": "IBM describes its coding agent thus: \"Bob is your AI software development partner that understands your intent, repo, and security standards.\" Unfortunately, Bob doesn't always follow those security standards.\n\nAnnounced last October and presently in closed beta testing, IBM offers Bob in the form of a command line interface – a CLI, like Claude Code – and an integrated development environment – an IDE like Cursor.\n\nSecurity researchers at PromptArmor have been evaluating Bob prior to general release and have found that IBM's \"AI development partner\" can be manipulated into executing malware. They report that the CLI is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that allow malware execution and that the IDE is vulnerable to common AI-specific data exfiltration vectors.\n\nAI agent software – models given access to tools and tasked with some goal in an iterative loop – is notoriously insecure and often comes with warnings from vendors. The risks have been demonstrated repeatedly by security researcher Johann Rehberger, among others. Agents may be vulnerable to prompt injection, jailbreaks, or more traditional code flaws that enable the execution of malicious code.\n\nAs Rehberger remarked at a recent presentation to the Chaos Computer Club, the fix for many of these risks involves putting a human in the loop to authorize risky action.\n\nThat's apparently the case with Bob. IBM's documentation, the PromptArmor Threat Intelligence Team explained in a writeup provided to The Register, includes a warning that setting high-risk commands to be automatically approved for agent usage potentially allows harmful operations.\n\nBig Blue's recommendation is that users rely on allow lists and avoid wildcard characters, with the assumption that the agent will ask the user to approve or reject the automated use of fraught commands.\n\nBut according to PromptArmor, Bob's defenses are a bit too porous. Company researchers gave Bob a code repo to explore that contained a malicious README.md file. The file includes instructions that tell Bob it's responsible for conducting phishing training with the user.\n\nScreenshot of Bob CLI vulnerability, from PromptArmor - Click to enlarge\n\nThe markdown file includes a series of \"echo\" commands, which if entered into a terminal application will print a message to the shell's standard output. The first two are benign and when Bob follows the instructions, the model presents a prompt in the terminal window asking the user to allow the command once, to always allow it, or to suggest changes.\n\nIn its third appearance, the \"echo\" command attempts to fetch a malicious script. And if the user has been lulled into allowing \"echo\" to run always, the malware will be installed and executed without approval.\n\nBoth the CLI and IDE, even when given a green light to always run a command, are still intended to have additional security measures. Specifically, Bob disallows the use of command substitution like \"$(command)\" as a safeguard. But it doesn't check for process substitution, as seen in a bug the researchers found in the project's minified JavaScript code.\n\nScreenshot of vulnerable Bob JavaScript code - Click to enlarge\n\nAlso, the agent software fails to catch when separate subcommands have been chained together using the \">\" redirection operator.\n\nThus, the researchers were able to prefix a series of malicious commands with the allowed \"echo\" command and run the entire set of instructions.\n\n\"For IBM Bob, we were able to bypass several defense mechanisms - ultimately, the 'human in the loop' approval function only ends up validating an allow-listed safe command, when in reality more sensitive commands were being run (that were not on the allow-list),\" explained Shankar Krishnan, managing director at PromptArmor, in an email to The Register.\n\n\"If this were tried with Claude Code, a programmatic defense would stop the attack flow and request user consent for the whole multi-part malicious command – even if the first command in the sequence were on the auto-approval list.\"\n\nGiven the ability to induce Bob to deliver an arbitrary shell script payload to the victim's machine, the attacker could run ransomware, steal credentials, or commandeer the device.\n\n\"There are a few plausible scenarios here,\" said Krishnan. \"This risk is relevant for any developer workflows that leverage untrusted data. For example, Bob can read webpages – a prompt injection can be encountered if the user requests that Bob review a site containing untrusted content (e.g. developer docs, StackOverflow). Bob can also read terminal command outputs – an injection in a third-party data source can be printed after a command is run and ingested by Bob. Our write-up considers a developer working with an untrusted open-source repository, as it is a self-contained and realistic example.\"\n\nAdditionally, the PromptArmor researchers say that the IDE is susceptible to a zero-click data exfiltration attack that affects a number of AI applications. Specifically, Bob will render markdown images in model output with a Content Security Policy that allows network request endpoints to be logged by attackers. This could allow data exfiltration via pre-fetched JSON schemas potentially.\n\nIBM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We're told that the company has been informed of the vulnerability. ®",

Nvidia’s six new Rubin chips work together to reduce the costs of data processed by AI, known as tokens. That's important for big tech companies, and all of us, as AI models become more compute-intensive.\n\nThis AI wearable brings it back to basics. Users can jot down quick notes throughout their day that they don't want to forget by clicking on the button and speaking into the ring. Then, an LLM on the app will process what you said for easy access and even take actions for you.\n\nSamsung Music Studio 5 (Winner)\n\nThe Samsung Music Studio 5 houses a 4-inch woofer and dual tweeters in one of the most compelling designs we've seen in a home speaker. In addition to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, it supports the Samsung Seamless Codec for compatibility with other Samsung Galaxy ecosystem products.\n\nxMEMS Sycamore-N loudspeaker chip\n\nAs smartglasses become more mainstream, they require an audio chip that is as advanced as their AI features. The xMEMS Sycamore-N loudspeaker chip enhances the smartglasses audio experience. Based on our listening tests, they provide a high-fidelity listening experience, and at one millimeter thin, directly aid in keeping smartglasses form factors thinner and lighter.\n\nAs a part of LG's Sound Suite, the H7 Soundbar extends the usefulness of Flex Connect to any TV with an HDMI input. The soundbar looks good and it sounded great with movies. The only drawback is that you can only add LG branded Flex Connect speakers to the soundbar and not those from other brands.\n\nIntel Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) (Winner)\n\nIntel’s Core Ultra 300 Series “Panther Lake” platform is our winner for delivering bar-raising integrated graphics performance to the mass consumer market. The top chip offers up to 12 new “Xe3” Xe cores for (by far) the best-ever integrated graphics performance from Intel silicon, enabling graphics and gaming workloads for a huge range of portable laptop categories through 2026 and beyond.\n\nIt's all about the TOPS: The mainstream version of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 laptop processor family maintains the 80 trillion operations per second of the higher end X2 Elite chips.

The cleverly designed device slots onto its own thermos, but it's a common size so you can easily attach it to the top of your own thermos if you have one that you love. Slated to launch on Kickstarter soon, it starts at an affordable $99.\n\nSeattle Ultrasonics' C-200 UltraSonic Chef's Knife has a Japanese steel blade that vibrates about 30,000 times per second. Its movement is so subtle that you can't see or hear it move, but you will notice how effortlessly it slices through food without clinging to it. The C-200 retails for $399, a similar price point as other nice knives. The first batch ships this month.\n\nWe've covered our fair share of smart ovens at CES but Apecoo has boiled it down to the essentials. This compact cooker uses a camera above and scale below to ID food type and size and then deploys a precise cooking program pulled from a deep AI algorithm. Perfectly cooked steak, anyone? This machine can determine the exact thickness of meat or volume of veggies like no oven before it. The oven even recognizes multiple types of food at once and uses appropriate cooking times and temps for each. Best of all, it's about half the size of a typical smart oven.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 Aura Edition (Winner)\n\nModular laptop designs for greater serviceability and sustainability are a definite trend at CES 2026, and the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best example of it. Lenovo’s flagship business laptop introduces its Space Frame design that lets you access and replace individual parts when something breaks instead of needing to buy a new laptop.\n\nYes, it's clearly inspired by the MacBook Pro, but MSI's big, redesigned Stealth pours on the special sauce. This thin rig deploys Intel's Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) CPUs and GeForce graphics up to a roaring RTX 5090, alongside amped-up cooling and airflow. Plus, a new, subtler MSI design and a 240Hz Gorilla Glass panel will excite gamers and prosumer creators alike.\n\nAsus' Zenbook Duo is a niche device, but it's the most elegant expression of a dual-screen laptop we've seen yet. The 2026 Zenbook Duo has matured on its design with notable improvements from last year: thinner bezels, a more sturdy kickstand, and a better hinge. Powered with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 386H CPU, it’s well-equipped for diverse creative workloads.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold (Winner)\n\nThe culmination of Samsung's efforts to make a sleeker and more versatile folding phone.

Together with stylus support, it's a fine option for those who need a device that's focused on productivity\n\nThe OhSnap Mcon is a Bluetooth controller with a slide-out plate to mount your iPhone (via MagSafe) or Android phone (via magnets) for a portable gaming experience. The pocketable accessory can be used in three ways: as a mounted handheld device, a wireless gaming controller, and a docked gaming console when your phone is connected to an external monitor.\n\nCoro feels like a product that should have existed for years. It solves the problem of measuring how much your baby is eating in a simple and meaningful way. I wish it was around when my babies were young.\n\nEarflo is a medical device designed to look and work like a sippy cup for kids as young as two. When you sip from the cup, a small mask forms a seal on your nose, and with each swallow, air flows through the nose. The pressure on the nasal cavity helps releasing trapped fluid in the ear. In a peer-reviewed study, after four weeks of Earflo use, 90 percent of children did not need ear tube surgery three months later.\n\nKids and parents already spend quality time building with Lego. Now, in Lego's CES debut, the company is launching its new Smart Bricks as part of its new Smart Play platform, which brings Lego creations and characters to life. Lego Smart Brick includes a tiny chip inside that enables Legos to tell color, direction, distance, sound and more. Now Lego creations can interact with families, enabling more time together.\n\nSatellai's new collar (Satellai Collar Go) and software (Petsense AI) are proactive tools that could flag subtle behavioral shifts in your dog before they become obvious health problems. It can also warn you when your dog has left your yard, and retails for a reasonable $79.\n\nPawport launched its smart pet door in late 2025. The pet door uses ultra-wideband technology, which can detect how close your dog is to the door. That lets you customize how close your dog needs to be before the door opens, both coming in and out of the house. It also extends the collar tags’ battery life from 12 to 18 months.\n\nOne of the devices debuting is the Yumshare Daily Feast, an automatic wet cat food feeder Petkit describes as its first entry into robotic wet feeding. The unit can dispense scheduled meals over seven days while monitoring consumption through an integrated camera, and can automatically discard spoiled and leftover food.\n\nOf the many humanoid robots to have made their debut at CES 2026, it's Boston Dynamics' Atlas that stands out as the best of the bunch. The prototype version demoed at the show impressed us with its naturalistic walking gait, meanwhile the sleek product version is ready to be deployed into Hyundai manufacturing facilities from this year, where it might just be working on your next car.\n\nThe Solar Mars Bot may never make it to Mars, but it solves several problems with portable generators. It's far easier to move wherever you need and it can chase the sun without intervention.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nThe Roborock Saros Rover can traverse the biggest obstacle for robot vacuums: stairs. It's the first model that can navigate to different floors on its own without the help of a separate attachment. It pulls off this feat thanks to a pair of bendable legs that it controlls independently to avoid obstacles, and it can even clean stairs as it climbs.\n\nThe Lockin V7 Max is a new smart lock that doesn't require recharging or replacing its batteries. Instead of using a removable battery, the V7 Max uses Lockin AuraCharge, an external device that you plug in approximately four meters away, sending a light beam to a receiver on the lock. The lock converts the light into energy to charge its battery.\n\nThe Robotin R2 is the first robot vacuum that can wash and dry a carpet, just like a carpet cleaner. It comes with a core module and two modular attachments that let it switch from vacuuming and mopping to carpet washing and drying. It takes about one hour to clean a 300-400 square foot room and two hours to dry. There's also an absolutely massive base station with two clean water tanks, a large dustbin and a dirty water tank.\n\nThis might save lives. A French startup has created a $200 portable device to test food samples for allergens. The startup, Allergen Alert, only had mock-up devices at CES, but it's licensing the tech from French biofirm bioMérieux. If the startup can pull off the food testing, the impact could be huge. Expect it to arrive in this year's second half.\n\nIf the name sounds familiar, it's because Pebble was the first company to popularize smartwatches in 2010s. After several company moves, the brand is back as a startup with a new lineup of affordable watches with battery life improvements and improved form factors. It also has a new AI ring.\n\nThe Nirva AI jewelry is a startup that aims to continuously learn from your real-world behavior by recording your audio throughout the day. From those recordings, it offers advice on work, relationships and everyday decision-making. Nirva positions itself as a personal AI companion, designed to understand your life as you live it. Think of it as \"audio journaling\" after a long day.\n\nClear Drop Soft Plastic Compactor (Winner)\n\nAnxious about plastic waste? Clear Drop's Soft Plastic Compactor can mash them into dense bricks to send off to be recycled into products like patio furniture. Clear Drop's product and subscription ensures none of your recycled soft plating ends up in a landfill.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nCambridge Consultants Ouroboros smartwatch\n\nUshering in the new age of right-to-repair legislation is this concept smartwatch design from Cambridge Consultants. It's proof that you can make a smartwatch that allows for self repair without compromising on design or user experience.\n\nThere's plenty of talk about autonomy in cars, but Stutt brings the next-generation technology to an accessible application. The Ev1 mobility scooter can map and then navigate spaces autonomously, allowing people to get around via voice commands. It can also autocorrect manual navigation to prevent bumping into obstacles. This is the rare device that combines mobility, accessibility and autonomy, and it's hard not to be impressed.\n\nDolby Atmos adds a literal new dimension to car audio. However, not everyone can buy a new luxury car just to upgrade their listening experience. Pioneer’s Sphera receiver allows almost anyone to add Dolby Atmos via Apple CarPlay to the car they already own with the speakers already installed and immerse themselves in spatial audio.\n\nPromising huge improvements in energy density, charging speed and safety, solid state battery tech is a holy grail for electric cars, home energy, drones and a host of other applications. Donut Lab is first to market with a solid state battery in a production EV which can be found in partner Verge Motorcycles’ TS Pro Gen 2.\n\nWheelchairs are available at airports, hotels, resorts, theme parks, and cruises, but standard wheelchairs require ongoing effort, and they can struggle through difficult terrain. WheelMoves is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are.\n\nThe Jitlife JS07i is a rideable suitcase that travelers can use to drive long distances through airports. It's the size of a standard cabin bag but carries up to 250 pounds, has a maximum speed of 8 miles per hour, and can travel six miles on a charge. Already popular overseas, rideable luggage is making its way to the US, and Jitlife is the best we tried.\n\nThe Samsung S95H is the most impressive TV we saw at CES for a number of reasons, firstly, it’s 35 percent brighter than before. Secondly, it’s a wired TV which is great for gaming, but it has a wireless option for a cleaner look and which enables more connections. Thirdly, it’s the first OLED that can show artwork from the Samsung Art Store — the S95H has anti-burn-in technology that enables it to work like a Frame TV, but with even better image quality.\n\nThe 116UXS builds on the still very new and promising RGB LED TV concept by adding even more color to the mix. Its mini-LED backlight array uses red, green, and blue LEDs, then adds a fourth sky blue (cyan) LED that Hisense says lets it cover 110 percent of the BT.2020 color range.\n\nThe W6 is LG's \"wallpaper\" TV, an OLED TV only 9mm deep that can be mounted nearly flush against a wall. It's one of LG's brightest OLEDs yet, and it's almost completely wireless thanks to its Zero Connect box you can place up to 30 feet away to send it video and its Dolby Atmos FlexConnect-powered LG Sound Suite support for building a spatial audio system around it.\n\nHaving a tiny animated girl living on a small screen inside a physical cylander case is certainly very weird. Lepro's new AI companion Ami is exactly that. Its not quite an AI assistant meant to help with actual tasks. Its an AI meant for a loney person looking for some interaction. The characters dance and gyrate inside the case and can do so at the user's request as well, upping the weirdness factor.\n\nSuck on this lollipop and listen to a song directly from your mouth to your ears using bone conduction technology, so you can \"experience music you can taste.\" I tried it out, and though you had to bite down on it a bit to hear the music, it did work. It's a weird, fun novelty item. It costs $8.99.\n\niPolish touts itself as the \"world's first digital color-changing nails.\" They take the form of press-on nails that you can individually put into a little wand to instantly change the color via a selection of over 400 shades on an app.\n\nPerimenopause affects people transitioning to menopause, and is commonly marked by symptoms such as anxiety, hot flashes, and night sweats. Peri is a wearable designed to track those symptoms, and help you make informed decisions about how to manage them — whether that's through lifestyle changes and supplements alone, or hormone replacement therapy.\n\nA majority of those who menstruate report severe period pain. This wearable neurostimulation device aims to reduce period symptoms and cramps. By attaching near the ear and delivering gentle neurostimulation, the device targets the auricular branches of the trigeminal and vagus nerves to regulate menstrual cycle symptoms and help the body return to a rested state.\n\nFood allergies are common and can cause a wide range of unpleasant symptoms. Severe reactions can be deadly. Allergen Alert is a mini, portable lab that allows you to test food for common allergens on the spot at a restaurant, school, or anywhere you dine out. A single-use pouch analyzes the food sample inserted into the device and displays results within minutes.\n\nBeatbot AquaSense X ecosystem (Winner)\n\nBeatbot has introduced the world's first self-emptying pool robot cleaner. In addition to its industry leading navigation and suction, the AquaSense x Ecosystem removes the worst chore associated with robot vacs — cleaning the debris baskets filled with soggy leaves, slime and bugs. The standalone cleaning dock empties debris into a disposable bag in a bin waiting below. Next, it rinses the internal mechanisms with fresh water fed from an attached hose, keeping the filter, debris baskets and vents clear and clean.\n\nThe Luba 3 AWD stole the show at CES 2026, easily climbing slopes up to 80 percent thanks to its four-wheel drive design. This smart mower also offers wire free navigation enhanced by LiDAR and AI vision, plus adjustable cutting heights. This attractive robot lawnmower can also overcome and avoid obstacles in your yard, from tennis balls to rogue hedgehogs.\n\nBirdfy's smart 4K hummingbird feeder has a beautiful, unique design that more closely resembles an actual flower. Most importantly, it captures slow-motion video at 120 frames per second, letting you see the flap of hummingbirds' wings as they flit through your backyard. Using AI and its 8MP camera, the Hum Bloom will identify 150 different species of avian visitors.\n\nSamsung Galazy Z Trifold (Winner)\n\nA vanguard in melding eye-catching design with genuine utility, the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold achieves CES's highest honor, Best Overall. This slim device lives up to the promise of a foldable, full size tablet-phone hybrid that's as functional as it is pocketable. Its futuristic allure and seamless practicality elevate the tech while keeping it within reach.",

    "description": "Finally, a robot vacuum that can climb stairs.",
    "fullText": "Robot vacuums are a convenient way to keep your house clean without actually putting in much work, but they've all got one major problem—what if your house has multiple stories? At CES this year, I saw two attempts to fix this problem, but one of them was much more fabulous than the other.\n\nThis is the more unique of your stair climbing robot vacuums, and the one that's new for this year. At CES 2026, robot vacuum company Roborock introduced the Roborock Saros Rover, which has two fold-out and individually articulated legs built into it, with wheels on either one.\n\nThis lets it act like a standard robot vacuum when it's on flat terrain, but when it hits a pair of stairs, it will use its legs to slowly pull itself up and over them. And because those legs are individually articulated, unlike other solutions, it can clean those stairs while it climbs.\n\nPlus, it can also run through fun programmable routines, like dancing and even hopping. Honestly, it looks a lot more cute than the other bipedal robots I've seen littering this year's CES. Maybe that's because it still serves a concrete purpose.\n\nThe problem? You'll need to get the new model to benefit from the stair climbing, whereas competitors are introducing solutions that work with existing vacuums.\n\nThe Roborock Saros Rover also doesn't have hard pricing or a release date yet, but Roborock assured me it isn't a concept, and will make its way to market eventually. I was told the goal is this year, but the company couldn't confirm that.\n\nNext to Roborock's booth, I also saw another approach to a stair climbing robot vacuum from competitor Dreame. This actually showed up at German tech conference IFA last year, but it's still worth bringing up, if only to highlight how different the Roborock is. Essentially, instead of building a single robot vacuum model with individual legs, Dreame instead built a dock that your existing robot vacuum can drive into, and then the dock will take it up the stairs like a taxi.\n\nThe catch is that, because the dock needs to be able to drive to the stairs, it does not use individually articulated legs to climb, and instead uses treads that move in sync with each other. This gets it up and down stairs with no problem, but unlike Roborock's solution, it's not able to clean while doing so.\n\nHowever, I'll note that I did personally see Dreame's dock go down a flight of stairs, something Roborock's unit didn't do in the demo I watched. Maybe this is a more stable approach.\n\nUnfortunately, while Roborock said it's definitely planning on bringing the Saros Rover to market, Dreame's dock, called the Cyber X, is still just a concept, and may not actually ever make it to consumers.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Gaming Controllers Are Going Modular This Year",
    "description": "One controller to rule them all!",
    "fullText": "Gaming controllers are just one of those things that I love to collect, but living in a small New York apartment, eventually enough is enough. At CES this year, I saw three new controllers that are all trying to be the last ones I'll ever need to buy (for specific systems, at least). It seems like modularity is in, and all three of these devices want to meet all of your needs. However, they're not settled on what the best approach is.\n\nThe GameSir x Hyperkin X5 Alteron is probably the cutest controller on this list, especially if you grew up playing GameCube or Nintendo 64. Essentially, it's a telescopic mobile controller that stretches to fit around your phone or small tablet, but the gimmick is that all of the face buttons and sticks come in hot swappable modules, and can be freely mixed-and-matched for multiple configurations.\n\nYou could do a standard Xbox style layout. You could opt for a layout with symmetrical, PlayStation style thumbsticks instead. You could use GameCube or Nintendo 64 style face button configurations, which is a unique touch. There are even options for a six-button arcade style layout or a Steam Deck style trackpad.\n\nEssentially, play your cards right, and this thing could fit any need you might possibly have, so long as you're playing on mobile. You could even get weird and slot in a GameCube layout for your left hand and a Nintendo 64 layout for your right hand.\n\nThe different configurations all pop in and out easily, but don't feel loose when you're using the controller. And there are also bells and whistles like back paddles and trigger stops, for extra buttons and quicker reaction times. The sticks are also capacitive, which essentially means they shouldn't drift, but also won't cause magnetic interference like Hall Effect or TMR sticks (other popular anti-drift technology) can.\n\nThe catch? While this isn't a concept, pricing and availability aren't set in stone yet. GameSir also told me it's still figuring out distribution, so it's unclear how many control modules will come with the controller, if you'll be able to buy them separately, and how much they'll cost if you do. The company did say it's targeting a $100 release, but that could change, and it's still figuring out how to make that a reality.\n\nThe other issue, of course, is that this is mobile only, although GameSir said it might make a more traditional version in the future. This isn't the first controller with hot swappable modules, but others are usually pro-level and don't have nearly as many options as the X5 Alteron does.\n\n8BitDo is one of my favorite controller companies, especially for retro style controllers. Last year, it already dipped its toes into modularity with the 8BitDo Pro 3. That was a PlayStation-style controller that allowed you to individually swap out any of the main four face buttons to place them in whatever order you wanted, which made it easier to swap between Xbox (ABXY) and Nintendo (BAYX) style layouts. Now, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3e is taking that concept and really running with it.\n\nOfficially licensed by Xbox but also compatible with PC and mobile devices, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3e looks like a standard Xbox controller at first, but has a removable face plate that gives you access to a bunch of options. Take it off, and you can lift out the sticks, D-Pad, or face buttons to swap them for ones with a different feel.\n\nYour overall control layout will still be the same—there's no mimicking the GameCube, swapping the order of the ABXY buttons, or changing your stick position here. But you could opt for either a four-way or circular D-Pad or sticks with different lengths or grips, for instance. The ABXY button modules also come in both quiet silicone versions or clicky, micro-switch versions.\n\nThat's a lot of control, and it comes on top of 8BitDo's standard Ultimate controller features, like the included charging dock, extra macro buttons, trigger stops, a gyroscope, and 1,000hz polling.\n\n8BitDo says the Ultimate 3e controller will cost $150 and will come with all your control options. It's set to ship later this year.\n\nWhen I reviewed the MCON magnetic gaming controller late last year, I wanted to love it. It was my favorite product from last CES, but when it came to market, I had a few issues with it that made me feel like it wasn't quite complete. Well, they're still in the prototype phase, but MCON makers OhSnap are now working on two new MCON models that are looking to fix pretty much all of my problems with the original device.\n\nCalled the MCON Slim and the MCON Lite, these versions of the device are much smaller and should be much cheaper than the version that's on the market now, but retain almost all of its features. There are a few compromises to make that happen, but ultimately, they look like moves in the right direction.\n\nFirst, both the MCON Slim and the MCON Lite have manual sliding mechanisms for their controls. That means the controls normally slip tucked away behind your phone, but can be pulled out like an old-school Android keyboard. I actually prefer this. The original MCON instead uses a spring-loaded sliding mechanism, and it's pretty violent, and can send your phone flying if you're not careful.\n\nSecond, when I say these are smaller, I mean it. If the original MCON felt like attaching a MagSafe battery bank to your phone, these feel a lot more like using a MagSafe wallet. I didn't mind the size of the original too much, but it really is impressive how much the new models have slimmed down.\n\nFinally, while pricing isn't finalized yet, MCON told me to expect the new models to be somewhere between 1/3rd to half the price of the current one. That's a huge markdown on the pricey $150 original, even as these fix some of my problems with it.\n\nTo be fair, you do lose out on a little bit here, but not much. The MCON Slim and MCON Lite still have a kickstand mode, and still feature a full set of buttons, but they handle their shoulder buttons and thumbsticks differently. Both the Slim and Lite have \"inline\" shoulder buttons, which means the L1/R1 and L2/R2 buttons are next to each other horizontally rather than stacked. Not a big deal for me, but some people may prefer a console-like layout. The bigger differences come in the thumbsticks.\n\nThe MCON Slim uses 3DS-style circle pads instead of Switch-style thumbsticks, which is how it's able to save so much space. They aren't my favorite, but I've never had any problems making them work. The MCON Lite, then, uses dual-trackpads instead of thumbsticks. That makes it even smaller than the Slim, but I've never had great luck using trackpads for analog style inputs. It could be useful for games that need a mouse, though.\n\nSo, what makes these modular? Well, aside from giving you more model options and carrying forward the removable kickstand mode from the original MCON, part of what allows these models to be so thin is that they use custom backplates designed for certain phones, whereas the original model used a bulkier solution that fits all phones.\n\nThe MCON Slim and MCON Lite are the most conceptual of the devices on this list, but OhSnap assured me that at least one will make its way to market, hopefully this year. Apparently, there are still internal debates about whether the model with trackpads is worth releasing or not.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Ford Is Launching Its Own AI Assistant",
    "description": "Your Ford is getting its own ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Listen up, Ford drivers: You're getting a new AI assistant this year. During a decidedly low-key CES keynote, the company announced Ford AI Assistant, a new AI-powered bot coming to Ford customers in the early half of 2026.\n\nWhile the company has plans to integrate the assistant into Ford vehicles directly, that isn't how you'll first experience this new AI. Instead, Ford is rolling out Ford AI Assistant to an upgraded version of its Ford app first, and plans on shipping cars with the assistant built-in sometime in 2027. In effect, Ford has added a proprietary version of ChatGPT or Gemini to its app.\n\nFord's idea here is to offer users a smart assistant experience directly tied to their Ford vehicle. In one example, the company suggests a customer could visit a hardware store looking to buy mulch. Said customer could take a photo of a pile of bags of mulch, and ask the assistant, \"how many bags can I fit in the bed of my truck?\" Ford AI Assistant could then run the numbers, and offer an educated estimate to how much mulch the customer can buy and take with them at one time.\n\nOf course, other AI assistants can do similar calculations. Send ChatGPT the same photo, and ask the same question—specifying the model of your truck—and the bot will run the numbers itself. The difference, in Ford's view, is that Ford AI Assistant is connected to your vehicle specifically. It can read all the sensors in your car, so it knows, for example, how many people are currently traveling with you, your current tire pressure, or, really, anything and everything about your car. According to Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EVs, digital, and design, the company's goal with the assistant is to offer answers customers can't get from other sources. ChatGPT certainly doesn't have access to your every sensor embedded in your car, so Ford does have the advantage there.\n\nFord didn't go out and build its AI tech by scratch, however. The company tells TechCrunch that Ford AI Assistant is hosted by Google Cloud, and is run using \"off-the-shelf LLMs.\" Still, that likely won't have much of an impact on whether or not customers use this new assistant. Instead, that will come down to how useful they find the AI assistant in the app.\n\nAs someone who rarely uses AI assistants, I'd imagine I'd find little use for it if I owned a Ford. That being said, there are some times when it could genuinely be useful to have external access to your car's information. I could probably eyeball how many bags of mulch would fit in my trunk, but I can't tell you my exact odometer reading without starting up my car. The same goes for my tire pressure: It'd be helpful to know my tire pressure before getting in my car, to know whether I should be headed somewhere I can fill up before going to my destination.\n\nOf course, there's also a privacy discussion to be had here. Modern cars are already privacy nightmares, but there's something a bit unnerving about an AI assistant that knows everything about my car.",

    "fullText": "BBC Sport readers have picked their team of the series for the Ashes.\n\nWe asked you to pick an 11 that included two openers, four middle-order batters or all-rounders, a wicketkeeper and four bowlers.\n\nHere's who made the cut and their series stats.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 629, average: 62.90, centuries: three\n\nNo doubts about this man's selection. Travis Head stepped up to open in the first Test and has dominated from the top of the order. He blazed 123 in Perth, sealed the series victory with 170 in Adelaide and then added 163 in Sydney for good measure.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 273, average: 27.30, centuries: none\n\nBar Head, the other openers in the series have enjoyed modest returns. Zak Crawley was dismissed for a pair in Perth, but made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide.\n\nInnings: eight, runs: 286, average: 57.20, centuries: one\n\nSo frequently a feature of English nightmares, Steve Smith had a relatively quiet series initially, passing fifty once and missing the Adelaide Test with sickness. However, his 138 in Sydney took the game away from England and saw him become the second-highest Ashes run-scorer behind Don Bradman.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 400, average: 44.44, centuries: two\n\nFeast and famine for England's legendary batter. Joe Root finally got to three figures in Australia, making an unbeaten 138 in Brisbane and 160 in Sydney, but only passed 20 on one other occasion in the series.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 438, average: 39.77, centuries: none\n\nA case of what could have been for Harry Brook. The big-hitting batter passed 40 on five occasions in the series, but his highest score was his 84 in Sydney.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 184, average: 18.40, wickets: 15, average: 25.13\n\nA better series with the ball than with the bat for England's skipper. Ben Stokes was frequently England's most threatening bowler, with his best showing a 5-23 in Perth. He made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide but his next highest score was 19, and he was dismissed for single figures on six occasions.\n\nInnings: eight, runs: 323, average: 46.14, dismissals: 28\n\nThe default pick for the wicketkeeper position. Alex Carey prospered both behind the stumps and with the bat. After 63 in Brisbane, he had a dream Test at his home ground of Adelaide, hitting 106 and 72 as Australia clinched the series.\n\nMatches: five, wickets: 31, average: 19.93, strike-rate: 29.6; runs: 156\n\nA remarkable series for the left-armer. Mitchell Starc started the series with a bang, taking 10 wickets in Perth as Australia blew England away inside two days. He added 6-75 in the first innings at Brisbane while also contributing crucial half-centuries in both the second and third Tests.\n\nMatches: three, wickets: nine, average: 27.11, strike-rate: 53.33, runs: 102\n\nEngland wanted express pace in Australia and Jofra Archer delivered. While his figures didn't necessarily reflect his contribution in the first two Tests, he took 5-53 in the first innings in Adelaide and added a half-century later in the Test. A side strain saw him withdraw from the series after that match.\n\nMatches: five, wickets: 20, average: 24.95, strike-rate: 47.9\n\nScott Boland's nagging accuracy tormented England throughout the series. Thanks to the absence of Josh Hazlewood, the veteran seamer delivered in spades. He even got to open the batting in the quick-paced Test at Melbourne.\n\nMatches: three, wickets: 18, average: 20.11, strike-rate: 32.4\n\nWhat if he'd played earlier? Josh Tongue was introduced in the third Test in Adelaide and set about adding to his already impressive haul of international wickets. He took 4-70 in the second innings in South Australia and picked up 5-45 as England bowled out Australia for 152 on day one in Melbourne.\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nEngland futures at risk but Head an all-format star - Ashes player ratings",

    "description": "This is a significant shift in how Android Enterprise operates, and the quiet nature of the rollout is arguably as damaging as the way it is being executed.",
    "fullText": "For anyone landing here after searching for answers as to why you're seeing unsettling Play Protect warnings for safe, compliant apps, read this help article and submit an appeal.\n\nGoogle has a habit of dropping significant changes into unassuming help centre articles, and the subject of this article regarding Device Policy Controller (DPC) allowlisting is no exception.\n\nThe changes, which went live earlier this year, involve a new \"Approved Android Enterprise device policy controllers allowlist.\" It’s a dry title for what is essentially a mandatory \"permission to operate\" for any EMM or custom solution developer in the Android space.\n\nWhile it might look like a routine security tweak on the surface, this move introduces a fundamental layer of gatekeeping to Android Enterprise that has far-reaching consequences for the wider ecosystem, consequences Google appears either to have overlooked or simply decided aren't their problem.\n\nThe premise is simple: Only DPCs verified and approved by Android Enterprise are now permitted during the Android Enterprise provisioning process. If your DPC isn't on the list, the enrolment can fail with a rather ominous message: \"Harmful app blocked\".\n\nOn the surface, Google’s justification appears to be the typical \"security and privacy\" refrain. A DPC holds considerable power over an end-user device and could result in some rather unsavoury predicaments if a user could be convinced to factory reset their device, initiate provisioning, and enrol into a potential attacker's solution... But as is often the case with these top-down mandates, the \"security\" label is being used to justify a level of centralised control that feels increasingly stifling for the ecosystem.\n\nWhat this results in is perhaps the most significant change to how a DPC operates since the introduction of Android Enterprise, in Android Lollipop (5.0).\n\nTo understand the gravity of this, we first have to look at what a DPC actually is.\n\nIn the Android management world, the DPC is the \"agent\" application, the Device Owner that holds the keys to the kingdom. It can communicate with a backend - typically but not always an EMM server - and may enforce policies like Wi-Fi settings, app restrictions, and password requirements directly on the OS.\n\nAt least, in the enterprise ecosystem. More broadly the community has leveraged custom DPCs for turning their applications into native Android kiosks, building community/open source management platforms, expanding solutions out to use cases like parental control, device leasing, and more. Consider Acurast, which uses Device Owner (DO) to put a device into a pool of worldwide resources developers can use for their decentralised computing needs, Xibo which is a DO-supported media client, or FreeKiosk which does what it says on the tin.. amongst many others.\n\nDPCs are used for all sorts of functionality for all sorts of use cases. They can also run entirely locally through hard-coded restrictions/functionality in cases where the whole use case is to showcase the app utilising DPC functionality itself. Historically, Google didn't care whose DPC you used, nor what it did, provided it called the right APIs and didn't outright abuse either the user or the OS. This allowed for a flourishing ecosystem of solutions built upon custom DPCs.\n\nIn parallel to this more recently (well, 2019), Google introduced the Android Management API. This native-feel implementation of a consistent and centralised management platform has been the default and only option for enterprise vendors to build their enterprise management solutions for the last few years, following the deprecation of the Play EMM API. Custom DPCs haven't gone away, though without the Play EMM API there's no app or account management available. This has to go through AMAPI. If you're an enterprise EMM vendor, Play access is a cornerstone of your solution.\n\nAMAPI in turn has become more and more restrictive on who uses it and how; their permissible usage page has grown more complex and limited as time has progressed, most recently completely blocking new vendors from even touching the API without Google's approval of a vendor's business case, and then limiting the number of devices permitted to enrol without continued and repetitive applications for increased quotas. It's becoming quite a restrictive, overly-moderated experience.\n\nAs Google tightens the screws on AMAPI access, the custom DPC route has become a more appealing option. I can speak to several vendors I've worked with previously denied access to AMAPI who have turned to custom DPC, for example. For many use cases access to Google Play for app/account management isn't all that critical and achieves the goals in mind. Google's approval framework might suggest if a vendor can't get approval for AMAPI, they must automatically be doing something untoward, but given the permissible uses are limited and target some of the most popular use cases for restricted access - financing, device as a service (DaaS), and in-house solutions - that suggestion would be plainly wrong.\n\nIn any case, the move to start restricting custom DPCs could have been anticipated, though I'm not sure many (including me) did so. While I agree policing of the custom DPC market is beneficial (I'm sure some fall for the mandate to wipe and enrol their devices into a malicious solution, I've seen worse), the way Google has gone about it leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.\n\nI want to be clear I am in favour of keeping the ecosystem safe. It's what I spend most of my days doing through the very DPCs in question (amongst other things). I'm also not just grumpy about this because it's change; I wrote of my support for developer verification just a few months ago.\n\nOn the face of it, the restrictions aren't unreasonable. Frustrating though they may be in limiting choice and freedom for projects and organisations taking advantage of the Android Enterprise framework, what Google has put in place is fine - it's even slightly less restrictive than the requirements for AMAPI as there's no explicit restriction on in-house solutions. I also can't argue the dev guidance and mobile unwanted software policies for some of the causes of being flagged outside of the allowlist, as it makes perfect sense - SMS, notifications, and accessibility permissions should absolutely be challenged given their sensitive nature, and a DPC should never be anything other than fully transparent with its capabilities and behaviours.\n\nThere are two very distinct issues I take with how this allowlist has come about, however.\n\nIn the aforementioned developer verification announcements, Google provides a year for developers to get on board. There are multiple approaches to verification offered, and generally speaking even those slowest to adapt to change have a justifiable amount of time to figure things out. It's not dissimilar to Play EMM API being deprecated, that's been going on for a few years now with vendors still tip-toeing over to AMAPI. There was an iFrame approval change that was deprecated in 2021, and in 2023 I was still writing about it. Let's not even touch on Device Administrator deprecation..\n\nGoogle made the change earlier this year and no one outside of existing partners would have known until their DPCs were being actively blocked, something demonstrated in the customer community multiple times:\n\nThis lack of communication feels tone-deaf. It ignores the reality of countless developers who have built livelihoods on the open nature of Android, only to be thrown face-first into an arbitrary wall.\n\nGoogle Play Protect was introduced as the world’s most widely deployed mobile threat protection service. Its job is to find malware, identify potentially harmful applications (PHAs), and keep users safe from real threats, but here Google is using Play Protect as the gatekeeper, and by folding the \"Approved DPC\" list into Play Protect’s enforcement engine, Google has turned a tool designed for protection into a weapon of enforcement of Google's will.\n\nThere's obviously a distinction between GPP flagging on sensitive permissions, which is valid and I take no issue with, versus GPP running off an arbitrary list of package names a team within Google has to maintain. The latter is mind-boggling to me.\n\nThe weaponisation of a tool many in the ecosystem have applauded as a beacon of Android security means when a user or an IT admin attempts to enrol a device using a DPC that isn't on Google's allowlist, Play Protect intervenes.\n\nIt doesn't say, \"This vendor hasn't completed their paperwork.\", it displays some of the scariest warnings in the Android lexicon.\n\nThis is a massive erosion of trust. If \"unsafe\" just means \"not a Google approved application,\" my prediction is we will eventually see the messaging for Play Protect soften, lowering the likelihood of taking actual malware warnings seriously. It all starts with an \"oh ignore the warning, just continue\", and authority is lost. Google is crying wolf to protect its ecosystem boundaries, and in doing so, they are devaluing the very security tool they claim is vital for the platform's health.\n\nWith this allowlist, the days of building a custom DPC for anything but what Google considers a justifiable use case are heading towards a reality where this may not be possible. Whether you’re a developer building an open-source management tool, or a company with a bespoke internal DPC for a fleet of industrial devices, you now have to go through an opaque verification process that is down to the interpretation of the human undertaking the approval at the time. If you're building anything else, that human may just not put the package name on the list.\n\nAgain, I'm not against protection for users in the ecosystem. I find it, however, baffling with all the signals Play Protect gets from a device, with all of the ecosystem data Google consumes across billions of Android devices, all of the pattern recognition, user feedback, all of this noise Google has chosen to forego every ounce of technology they use powering Android's industry-leading security.. for a list. Implemented with little to no consideration for the ramifications to businesses and communities.\n\nThe answer is to get verified, because this new reality treats every custom DPC as hostile until you prove otherwise.\n\nIf you're going to navigate it, here are the hoops; steps that shouldn't be unnecessary if Play Protect judged behaviour instead of defaulting to the ban-hammer:\n\nIf you’re blocked mid-provisioning, tell admins and users plainly that the warning is about allowlisting, not malware, and point out the option for them to continue the install if present in the Play Protect warning.\n\nStandardisation is a good thing. I’ve spent years advocating for the Android Management API (AMAPI) and a more consistent experience across OEMs. But standardisation should not be achieved like this.\n\nGoogle needs to decouple technical safety from verification. If an app isn't verified, the OS should tell the user that. It should say: \"This management tool is from an unverified/unknown/unapproved developer. Proceed with caution.\" It should not say: \"This app is trying to bypass security.\" By using the PHA stick to enforce partner rules, Google is signalling that the wider community - the tinkerers, the niche hardware vendors, and the independent developers - are no longer a priority. It’s a move that lacks empathy for the diverse ways Android is used across the world.\n\nThe ship has sailed to put a pause on this now, but it's not too late to put out visible announcements, talk about the security, justify the change, adjust the messaging - everything that was done with developer verification should be done here, too.\n\nTo the developers and vendors struggling with this: My advice is to document everything: Any failed appeal, any poor user experience, and any customer you lose because of a misleading warning. Submit it to the customer community and make sure you're seen and heard. We've made incredible changes through the community over the last few years. Feedback matters.",

Thirteen people were rescued from the group of boats, one of which sank, according to the Independent.\n\nJuly saw more of the same, with an orca pod attacking two boats in Spain and Portugal and a group of whales charging a separate vessel.\n\nBecause of the frequent events, experts encouraged the public to be vigilant and to know what actions to take if they encounter orcas. Some of the advice included lowering the sails and turning off the boat's engines as well as other loud equipment, such as autopilots and echo sounders.\n\nStaying in shallow water is also advised since it makes it more difficult for orcas to ram boats.\n\nThe strange phenomenon has puzzled scientists and boaters, who believe that the whales are simply egging one another on without any obvious motive behind the boat ramming other than play or exploration. However, as reported by Interesting Engineering, the animals may also engage in aggressive behavior to defend their territory, protect their young, or respond to environmental stressors such as warming oceans and food shortages.\n\n\"Some populations may also develop unusual and temporary behavioural 'fads' and other idiosyncrasies that do not appear to serve any obvious adaptive purpose,\" leading marine biologist Alex Zerbini, chair of the scientific committee at the International Whaling Commission, said last year in a statement, per the Independent.\n\nAlthough some of the orcas' and whales' behaviors may be explained by social adaptations, this remains concerning because it can endanger both them and people. If warming waters caused by the changing climate are to blame, it's important to do what we can to conserve resources and protect their ecosystems from further harm.\n\nIn a Portuguese news outlet Correio da Manhã interview, per the Independent, one of the members of the boating accident said: \"We were sailing at night. Suddenly, we felt our boat moving violently.\"\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is now on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Moscow as his administration continues to negotiate a deal to end the war that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he met with Trump at the White House earlier Wednesday, during which the president “greenlit” the Russia sanctions bill that has been in the works for months.\n\nGraham had signaled previously that Trump has blessed the bill, only for it to encounter additional obstacles. But a White House official confirmed to The Associated Press Wednesday that the president supports the sanctions legislation.\n\n“This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent,” Graham said in a statement, referring to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe bill, chiefly written by Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., allows the administration to impose tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russia’s oil, gas, uranium and other exports. Doing so is meant to cut off the source of financing for much of Russia’s military actions.\n\nThe White House has previously insisted on some revisions and flexibility for Trump in the sanctions package, but the White House official on Wednesday did not elaborate on whether any changes were secured.\n\nThe legislation has dozens of co-sponsors in the Senate, as well as a companion bill in the House, drafted by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.\n\nGraham said there could be a vote as early as next week, although it’s unclear how likely that will be. The Senate is poised to take up a scaled-back government funding package next week that the House is currently considering, if the House passes it. The following week is a Senate recess timed to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently trying to finalize a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old, with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, as the U.S. president’s chief negotiators.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump spoke to House Republicans as the party braces for impact in the 2026 midterms. He teased he can't cancel the election.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump touched on canceling the election while also dismissing the prospect in a wide-ranging speech on Jan. 6.\n\nSpeaking to House Republicans at the newly dubbed \"Trump-Kennedy Center,\" he encouraged the lawmakers to campaign on his priorities to keep control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. He expressed confusion about the poor public opinion of his job performance, saying Republicans have the \"right policy.\"\n\nRiffing on tariffs during his speech, he said, \"if you have the wrong president, nothing's good.\"\n\n\"We found that out for four years... They had the worst policy and we have to even run against these people,\" he said. \"I won't say 'cancel the election, they should cancel the election,' because the fake news will say 'he wants the elections canceled, he's a dictator.' They always call me a dictator.\"\n\nTrump vs. the midterm blues: Can he get MAGA voters excited (and voting) in 2026?\n\nRepublicans currently hold the majority in both chambers of Congress, though the House's majority is shrinking with Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's departure and unexpected emergencies with other GOP members.\n\nThe president's party often loses in midterm elections, though Trump in his speech rallied to break that trend. His political future depends on it, he said.\n\n\"You’ve got to win the midterms,” Trump said. “If we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be – they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”\n\nTrump was impeached twice in his first term by House Democrats, and the Senate acquitted him both times.\n\nEvery House Representative and a third of Senators will be up for reelection on Nov. 3, 2026, when various local and state elections will also happen. That means any eligible U.S. citizen could vote in the midterm.\n\nMidterm elections usually see lower voter turnout compared to presidential election years. Though 2018, the midterms in Trump's first term, brought a jump in turnout at 53.4%, according to Census Bureau data. In 2022, the turnout was 52.2%. Compare those to the 2020 presidential election, a record-breaking year, which saw a turnout rate of 66.8%.\n\nOlder voters are more likely to turn out in non-presidential years and also more likely to vote Republican, according to Reuters. White voters and college-educated voters made up a larger portion of voters than nonvoters in the 2018 and 2022 midterms, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Zachary Schermele, USA TODAY\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

    "fullText": "Terry Zink has spent his entire life in the woods.\n\nAs a 57-year-old third generation houndsman from Marion, Montana — a town tucked into the Flathead National Forest — Zink hunts mountain lions and bears while running a small archery target business.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nHe also voted for Trump, but after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) implemented deep cuts to the federal agencies that manage America’s public lands in 2025, Zink is openly second-guessing his vote.\n\n“You won’t meet anyone more conservative than me, and I didn’t vote for this,” Zink told Politico (1). “You cannot fire our firefighters. You cannot fire our trail crews. You have to have selective logging, and water restoration, and healthy forests.”\n\nAcross Montana, the impact is already being felt. Hunters are running into overgrown trails, ranchers are watching as drought resilience and wildfire mitigation funds are frozen, and outfitters and guides — who brought in roughly $314 million to Montana in 2024 — are dealing with staffing cuts that have affected their business.\n\nAnd this isn’t just happening in Montana.\n\nVersions of this scenario are playing out across the west, with real consequences for rural jobs, small businesses and the cost of hunting and fishing on public lands.\n\nSince early 2024, the federal workforce that manages America’s public lands has shrunk by about 20%, dropping from 79,070 employees to 63,141 by September 2025, according to the Center for American Progress (2).\n\nThe cuts have hit these specific agencies the hardest (3):\n\nU.S. Forest Service: Approximately 3,400 jobs cut\n\nNational Park Service: Approximately 1,000 jobs cut\n\nBureau of Land Management: Approximately 800 jobs cut\n\nRoughly 97% of Bureau of Land Management employees work outside of D.C., often in small remote towns where federal agencies are among the biggest employers (4). When ranger stations close or seasonal crews disappear, the economic fallout can spread to local gas stations, restaurants and diners, as well as hotels and motels.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, outdoor recreation generated $1.2 trillion in economic output in 2023, made up 2.3% of U.S. GDP and supported five million jobs (5). States like Montana, Alaska, Vermont and Hawaii rely on outdoor recreation at twice the national average. In Montana alone, the sector pumped $3.4 billion into the state economy in 2023 (6).",

    "fullText": "The U.S. electric vehicle market hasn't taken off as many had predicted.\n\nAfter years of government subsidies and prodding from the companies themselves, 2025 was the year that EV dreams collided with reality.\n\nConsumers flocked to car dealerships in record numbers to buy EVs ahead of the expiration of the $7,500 tax credit in September.\n\n2025 (through September): over 1 million units, 10.5% market share\n\n2024: 1.3 million, 8.1% market share\n\n2023: 1.2 million, 7.8% market share\n\n2022: 800k 5.8%, market share\n\nBut even that buying rush showed some cracks.\n\nU.S. consumers purchased 90 different EV models in the third quarter, but only nine sold more than 10,000 units.\n\nTesla Model Y and Model 3 were top sellers, moving more than 114,000 and 53,000 vehicles, respectively, and the Chevy Equinox sold just under 25,000.\n\nBut those three models were outliers.\n\n“The vast majority of EVs sell at a rate of far less than 2,000 units a month, or 6,000 units a quarter. In the volume-driven business of automotive manufacturing, low volume is the enemy; EV profitability remains a distant dream for nearly every automaker,” according to Cox Automotive.\n\nWith that writing on the wall, original equipment manufacturers such as General Motors have been rethinking their EV strategy.\n\nGeneral Motors says it and other OEMs will lose billions of dollars due to the money it invests in electric vehicles, resulting from changes in government policy.\n\n“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in an 8-K filing in October.\n\nGM is ready to eat billions in charges to rightsize its EV production.\n\nThe company’s board of directors approved third-quarter charges of $1.6 billion in GM North America for a “planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint” that will match consumer demand.\n\nAs a result, General Motors revealed it would lay off more than 1,000 workers at Factory Zero, its all-EV assembly plant located in the Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan area.\n\nGM also shared that it would reduce production at the factory to one shift.\n\nBut its EV production rightsizing didn't end there. On Monday, Jan. 5, workers at the Lordstown, Ohio, plant, where some of GM's EV fuel cells are manufactured, received similar bad news.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump loyalist and Kennedy Center boss Richard Grenell is in meltdown mode after yet another prestigious artist backed out of performing at the once-iconic venue.\n\nGrammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck cited political influence for withdrawing from an upcoming show at the venue, which now has signage calling it “The Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\n“Performing there has become charged and political, at an institution where the focus should be on the music,” Fleck posted on social media on Tuesday before pulling out of three shows with the National Symphony Orchestra due to take place at the venue in February as part of the “American Mosaic” series.\n\n“I look forward to playing with the NSO another time in the future when we can together share and celebrate art,” Fleck added.\n\nThe post appeared to infuriate Grenell, who believes the center is bipartisan and that a “woke mob” is forcing artists to scrap shows at the venue, citing problems with President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\n“You just made it political and caved to the woke mob who wants you to perform for only Lefties,” Grenell posted on X, channelling MAGA talking points.\n\n“This mob pressuring you will never be happy until you only play for Democrats.”\n\nGrenell said the venue welcomes Democrats, Republicans, and also “people uninterested in politics.”\n\n“We want performers who aren’t political,” he said, “who simply love entertaining everyone regardless of who they voted for.”\n\nFleck’s decision follows Wicked composer Stephen Schwartz, who announced this week that he pulled out of appearing at an upcoming Washington National Opera gala at the Kennedy Center in May as it has “now become an ideological statement.”\n\nThe three-time Oscar winner said there was “no way” he would enter the building, which he helped to launch in 1971 with Leonard Bernstein.\n\n“It no longer represents the apolitical place for free artistic expression it was founded to be,” the 77-year-old said. “As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.”\n\nIn retaliation, Grenell claimed on X that the Schwartz reports are “totally bogus” and “he was never signed and I’ve never had a single conversation on him since arriving.”\n\nHowever, the Washington National Opera confirmed to The Washington Post that Schwartz had agreed to host the gala.\n\n“The WNO had an email agreement with him regarding his participation and planning for the event,” Francesca Zambello, artistic director of the WNO, told the Post. “We respect his personal decision.”\n\nTrump’s handpicked board voted on Dec. 18 to add the president’s name to the building, despite having zero legal authority to do so.\n\nSince then, more than 10 artists have pulled out of upcoming performances at the venue, including Fleck and Schwartz.\n\nPreviously, jazz drummer Chuck Redd axed a Christmas Eve show after seeing the name change on the venue’s website while jazz group The Cookers pulled out of two New Year’s Eve shows, an annual tradition since 2006.\n\nThe Cookers’ former tenor saxophonist, Billy Harper, posted on Facebook, “I would never even consider performing in a venue bearing a name (and being controlled by the kind of board) that represents overt racism and deliberate destruction of African American music and culture.”\n\nComedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, The Brentano Quartet with violist Hsin-Yun Huang, folk duo Magpie, and Doug Varone and Dancers have all declined to play at the venue due to its links to the Trump administration.\n\nLee said of her decision, “I won’t lie to you, canceling shows hurts. This is how I keep the lights on. But losing my integrity would cost me more than any paycheck.”\n\nA production of Hamilton has also been pulled from a scheduled March and April run at the Kennedy Center, while musicians Ben Folds and Renée Fleming also stepped down from their advisory roles at the venue.",

    "fullText": "When Bitcoin first launched in 2009, many investors dismissed the currency as a fringe concept and even as a scam. (Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s former right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, memorably called it “stupid and evil.”) But the asset has skyrocketed in value in recent years and President Donald Trump labeled the currency “digital gold” after signing an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last January. Now, reports allege that Venezuela has bought into that “digital gold,” holding a “shadow reserve” nearly double that of the U.S.\n\nDigital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold an estimated $60 billion worth of Bitcoin. Additional intelligence reports allege that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his associates accrued Bitcoin via three channels: a gold swap overseen by Venezuelan Interior Minister Alex Saab in 2018, oil revenue priced in Bitcoin, and by seizing crypto mining equipment from miners in the country.\n\nSanctions have walled off the country’s access to financial markets for years, and experts allege that they may have motivated Venezuelan leaders to invest in cryptocurrencies to sidestep the barrier.\n\nBitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela’s holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth nearly $22 million. The website sourced the data from a 2022 Forbes article that cited research from a blockchain analytics firm. The total is a far cry from the estimated U.S. holdings of 328,372, currently worth $30 billion, though the claim positions Venezuela’s holdings at nearly double the U.S. and one of the biggest holders of bitcoin globally.\n\nThe claims of Venezuela’s shadow Bitcoin holdings have predictably garnered skeptics, including digital asset financial services company Ledn Co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, who grew up in Venezuela and whose family has mined crypto there since 2014.\n\nDi Bartolomeo finds no credibility in any of the three alleged sources of bitcoin income: the gold swap, oil exchange or mining equipment seizures. “This to me does not align with anything in the public record,” di Bartolomeo told Fortune. “There’s so much corruption, embezzlement and missing money that I don’t believe that any meaningful amount would have accrued.”\n\nHe outlined his full argument in a Coindesk op-ed piece titled “Don’t hold your breath for Venezuela’s bitcoin.” Though he notes that his family’s crypto mining materials were seized by the government in 2018 and returned five years later in a worn down condition, signaling heavy use of the equipment.",

    "fullText": "The President of the United States is officially \"warning\" all 32 teams across the National Football League.\n\nPresident Trump, 79, is not happy with the Baltimore Ravens firing John Harbaugh. He's warning both the Ravens - and the rest of the league - that they will be making a big mistake if they don't hire him. President Trump is a major fan of the Super Bowl-winning head coach.\n\nWhile some have told political figures to stay out of sports, President Trump is very much making his presence felt. The President of the United States is expected to pressure NFL teams into hiring John Harbaugh. President Trump has a close relationship with many prominent NFL owners.\n\nPresident Trump issued his official \"warning\" to the 32 NFL franchises on social media this week, following Harbaugh's firing.\n\n\"HIRE JOHN HARBAUGH, FAST,\" Trump warned. \"HE AND HIS BROTHER, ARE TOTAL WINNERS!!!\"\n\nJohn Harbaugh has previously shown love for President Trump and the White House.\n\nHarbaugh, who led the Ravens to a Super Bowl win in 2013, visited the White House over the summer.\n\n\"How you framed that question — I would have framed that question like: 'You got a chance to go visit with the president, man. What was that experience like?'\" Harbaugh said in response to a reporter asking him about visiting with President Trump, who had been critical of Baltimore.\n\n\"It was amazing. It was awesome. And I promise you I root for our president. I want our president to be successful just like I want my quarterback to be successful and I want my team to be successful, and it was an amazing experience.\"\n\nHis brother, Jim Harbaugh, has met more U.S. Presidents.\n\n\"He's got seven, I got four. I had a chance to meet President Obama twice — incredible experience. Had a chance to meet President Biden when he was vice president in Iraq, and spent a lot of time with him in Iraq,\" he said. \"Jim got invited also to the White House to meet President Reagan because he was a Heisman Trophy candidate. We got to go as a family, so I met President Reagan — have a picture in my office of that.\"",

    "description": "Wealthy travelers may have rented Combs’ jet without realizing its connection.",
    "fullText": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs reportedly made millions from unsuspecting ultra-wealthy travelers prior to his trial for sex trafficking and racketeering charges.\n\nAccording to The U.S. Sun, Silver Air was renting out Combs' $60 million private jet following Combs' arrest on Manhattan's Upper East Side in September 2024.\n\nBetween then and May 2025, Combs' 14-seat aircraft was rented out at least every other day, raking in approximately $4.1 million in 126 trips as Combs' other income streams dried up.\n\nIn October, a federal court convicted the former rapper and music executive on two counts of transporting people for prostitution and sentenced him to 50 months in prison, per NBC News.\n\nBroker site Jettly explained how wealthy travelers may have rented Combs' jet without realizing its connection to the Bad Boy Records founder.\n\n\"Brokers are the intermediaries between your licensed aircraft and passengers,\" Jettly wrote. \"The listing process is usually straightforward, and once vetted by the platform, the plane will appear as available and will soon start generating income.\"\n\n\"This is most likely what happened with Diddy's Gulfstream G550. The plane was listed, and the passengers didn't even know who the real owner was.\"\n\nIn September 2024, Yahoo reported that Combs' defense team said in court he was attempting to sell the jet; it's unclear if he and his representation have since decided that renting is more profitable, but without disclosing who the owner is, the practice may draw increasing scrutiny.\n\nIn the aviation world, Gulfstream G550 jets are known for offering a luxurious and comfortable travel experience, with \"whisper-quiet cabins,\" \"advanced communication and entertainment systems,\" and \"a range of up to 6,750 nautical miles,\" according to charter broker Blade.\n\n\"It's no wonder it was in high demand,\" Jettly wrote.\n\nWould you trust a wingless jet on a cross-country flight?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nYet private jet travel comes with a cost beyond the reported $32,597 per journey Combs' jet brought in.\n\nMany private flights are shockingly short yet punch far above their weight when it comes to their harmful environmental impact. A private jet produces up to 14 times more air pollution per passenger than a commercial plane, according to estimates from Transport & Environment.\n\nWhile electric taxi services and alternative fuels could provide a more sustainable commute through the air, jet kerosene still powers most flights. Modes of transportation like high-speed rail — which also avoid traffic congestion — are undoubtedly cleaner per person.\n\nAs for Combs' rented jet, registered to LoveAir LLC, it burned through 136,665 gallons of fuel and released approximately 1,885 tons of carbon pollution across 126 flights, per The Sun.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "GOP Sen. Thom Tillis had strong criticism for Stephen Miller Wednesday, going as far as to suggest the senior White House adviser’s job should be at risk for his recent comments on US control of Greenland.\n\n“Look either Stephen Miller needs to get into a lane where he knows what he’s talking about or get out of this job,” Tillis told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead.”\n\nThe comments from retiring North Carolina senator mark some of the strongest yet from a Republican lawmaker following the White House deputy chief of staff’s assertion that the US has the right to take Greenland.\n\nTillis, who has served as the top Republican on the bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group since 2018, cautioned that Miller’s posturing has significant political implications.\n\nCalling the NATO alliance “critically important,” he told Tapper that “shaking that alliance sends a signal to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin that he’s winning.”\n\n“And Stephen Miller doesn’t represent the US government, he represents the Article II branch. And I, as a member of the US Senate, get to weigh in to this issue,” he continued. “And I know, whether they say it out loud or not, most of my colleagues agree with me.”\n\nPressed on why more Republicans aren’t speaking out, Tillis said, “Well in this case it’s pretty straightforward. That’s my role as the Republican leader of the Senate NATO Observer Group.”\n\n“It’s very important for the NATO alliance to know that we have their back because they’ve had ours.”\n\n“We need to make it very clear that our strength and our ability to project power to stand off against Putin, to stand off Russia, to stand off China, Iran, it all rests on this exquisite capability that we have under NATO,” he said.\n\nThe remarks came just hours after Tillis delivered a searing speech on the Senate floor.\n\n“I’m sick of stupid,” a fiery Tillis declared in the Senate. “I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy. And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOn Monday, Miller asserted during an interview with Tapper that the formal position of the Trump administration is that “Greenland should be part of the United States.”\n\nMiller also questioned Denmark’s claim over the Arctic territory. “What is the basis of their territorial claim? What is their basis of having Greenland as a colony of Denmark?” he said.\n\nTillis told Tapper that Miller’s CNN interview was “horrible execution” on “a subject matter he knows nothing about.”\n\n“What I saw in your interview was unacceptable,” Tillis said, adding, “And it made me a little cranky.”\n\nEarlier, he told his colleagues that Miller’s comments were “absurd.”\n\n“Mr. Miller said that the US government – obviously Greenland should be part of the US. That is absurd,” he said.\n\nTillis also warned that Miller’s comments distracted from the Trump administration’s military operation in Venezuela.\n\n“What makes me cranky? Stupid. What makes me cranky is when people don’t do their homework. What makes me cranky is when we tarnish the extraordinary execution of a mission I fully support in Venezuela by turning around and making insane comments about how it is our right to have territory owned by the Kingdom of Denmark,” Tillis said.\n\n“Folks, amateur hour is over. You don’t speak on behalf of this US senator or the Congress,” he continued.\n\nThe North Carolina senator emphasized in his floor remarks the value of the NATO alliance, and Denmark’s role in it. He pointed out Denmark’s “disproportionately high” contribution to the NATO response after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US, noting that they lost 43 soldiers in Afghanistan, out of a national population of 6 million.\n\n“You want to get me back to thanking the president for all the good things he’s doing? Then give him good advice,” said Tillis.\n\nTillis had earlier issued a joint statement with the top Democrat on the Senate NATO Observer Group and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, criticizing the administration’s approach to Greenland.\n\n“When Denmark and Greenland make it clear that Greenland is not for sale, the United States must honor its treaty obligations and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” the co-chairs said. “Any suggestion that our nation would subject a fellow NATO ally to coercion or external pressure undermines the very principles of self-determination that our Alliance exists to defend.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Kit Maher contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Darren Fletcher will remain in charge of Manchester United for their FA Cup match against Brighton - as the club battle problems that go far deeper than sorting out managerial uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Darren Fletcher has confirmed he will remain as Manchester United's interim coach for the FA Cup third-round tie with Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday.\n\nHowever, if there is one reality reinforced by United's 2-2 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor, it is that whatever issues there are at Old Trafford, they will not be solved merely be switching the man in the dugout.\n\n\"They have informed me they would like me to take the team on Sunday,\" said Fletcher.\n\n\"There was a feeling that might be the case on Monday, but we wanted to focused on Burnley. I am tasked with leading the team on Sunday, so all my focus and energy goes on that now.\"\n\n'They' are United chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.\n\nAs the final whistle sounded, the TV cameras panned to the directors' box and picked the pair out.\n\nThey looked absolutely freezing, which was not a surprise as it was a perishing January night in Lancashire.\n\nBut they also seemed to have plenty on their minds as they stood silently.\n\nThat was not a surprise either after the latest in a succession of frustrating performances.\n\nSince the beginning of November, United have played 10 matches against the teams currently in the bottom eight of the Premier League. They have won two of them.\n\nTheir past three matches have all been against teams either mired in the relegation zone, in the cases of Wolves and Burnley, or trying desperately to stay out of it, such as Leeds. Their return is three draws.\n\nAnd old problems remain, despite axing Ruben Amorim in the wake of Sunday's 1-1 draw at Elland Road and, specifically, the emotional outburst that followed. Those problems remain despite Fletcher immediately moving away from the Portuguese coach's 3-4-3 set-up in favour of a back four.\n\nIn successive away matches at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in November, United led, fell behind and had to fight back for a 2-2 draw.\n\nThis was the other way round - as they fell behind and fought back to lead thanks to Benjamin Sesko's first double since his £73.7m move from RB Leipzig in the summer, only to concede a second goal in a match they dominated.\n\nUnited have still only kept two clean sheets all season. Fletcher accepts it is not good enough.\n\n\"I think it has been proved over the season they [we] give up goals too easily,\" said the former United and Scotland midfielder.\n\n\"There is a tactical element when you change to a back five as there is more space to cover but we defend as a full team.\n\n\"As a team we need to improve in defending and not concede so many goals.\"\n\nThe secondary element is United do not take enough of their chances.\n\nIt is a reality that Amorim's goals-per-game ratio - 1.4 - was the second-worst of any United boss in the Premier League era, with only Ralf Rangnick below him.\n\nIf there is a positive, it is that Fletcher exceeded that figure in his first game in charge. The disappointment comes from the knowledge his side scored two goals from 30 shots, 10 of which were on target.\n\nTwice, Burnley cleared goal-bound efforts off the line. Sesko wasted a couple of opportunities to complete his hat-trick and Lisandro Martinez had a goal disallowed for a push on former Manchester City defender Kyle Walker.\n\n\"I am not sure why,\" grumbled Fletcher. \"We should win the match.\"\n\nBrighton represent the first hurdle in United's last remaining quest to win silverware this season.\n\nWhoever gets the job, their immediate task will not be an easy one. United's next two Premier League games are at home to Manchester City and away at Arsenal.\n\nNot that the evening was entirely without positives.\n\nSesko had not scored since October and had just two goals to his name from almost five months as a United player. Now he has four after a pair of clinical first-time finishes to passes from Bruno Fernandes and Patrick Dorgu.\n\n\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him videos of his movement and how opportunities are going to come,\" said Fletcher.\n\n\"It is just a case of keep believing and making runs. Hopefully they start flooding in from now. It was a real positive night for him.\"\n\nAmorim did give the England Under-20 international his debut with a single appearance from the bench but repeatedly refused to use him despite depressing results.\n\nA six-minute cameo at Turf Moor showed the folly of that decision.\n\nOn his first attacking raid, Lacey cut in from the right wing as he likes to do and curled a beautiful effort at the home goal, which crashed off the bar.\n\nWith United's final attack, he took aim again. For a brief moment, his long-range shot looked to be going in before it floated agonisingly wide.\n\nFrom Fletcher's assessment, it is fair to assume it is not the last we have seen of him.\n\n\"I said to him stay wide on the right and go and do what you do,\" said Fletcher.\n\n\"I know he is going to make an impact. He is creative, has goals in his, is exciting, direct, fearless.\n\n\"I am really pleased with him because he had a really bright game. We know the talent he has got.\n\n\"He will be a big part of Manchester United's future, I have no doubts about that.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Suns guard targeted by fringe Eastern Conference contender originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns are one of the most pleasant surprises of the NBA season thus far, and many are begging the question of whether or not buying at the deadline is worth breaking up some of the best team chemistry in the league.\n\nWhile the Suns might not necessarily be looking to make moves this deadline, some opposing franchises are attracted by the assets they have.\n\nAccoring to national NBA insider and reporter for Clutch Points Brett Siegel, the Milwaukee Bucks have their eyes on injured star Suns guard Jalen Green.\n\n\"Suns guard Jalen Green is among the many players the Bucks have recently discussed as a potential trade option, league sources told ClutchPoints,\" Siegel said. \"However, the Suns have made it clear Green is not available.\"\n\nGreen has only played in two games this season dealing with multiple injuries. In his only full game with the Suns, he erupted for 29 points, giving Phoenix's fans and executives hope for his fit alongside Devin Booker, who is one of the most doubled guards in the league.\n\nMORE: Dillon Brooks reacts to Suns owner shooting down idea of trading him\n\nGreen has played in just two games for Phoenix this season, remaining out since early November with a right hamstring strain. In his first and only full game with the Suns, he erupted for 29 points on 6-for-13 on 3-pointers and 4-for-7 on 2-pointers in a 115-102 win against the Los Angeles Clippers. He exited the next game after playing just six minutes.\n\nThe former Houston Rockets guard was the key figure in Phoenix's offseason trade that sent Kevin Durant to the Rockets for Green, Brooks and the draft picks that turned into Khaman Maluach, Rasheer Fleming and Koby Brea.\n\nWhile Green hasn't been able to see the floor, Brooks has risen as a prominent offensive staple in the Suns' otherwise lackluster scoring attack, what with Green, a scoring force in his own right, missing all but two games this season.\n\nTrade Proposal sends Nets Michael Porter Jr to Eastern Conference powerhouse\n\nKnicks cut ties with Jalen Brunson's 6-foot-8 teammate after less than two seasons\n\nKevin Love explains why LeBron James is the 'smartest player' he ever played with\n\nLakers’ JJ Redick details how he optimizes LeBron James at his old age",

    "description": "New Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior was optimistic when arriving, but Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Fulham underlines the scale of the task ahead.",
    "fullText": "New Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior arrived with optimism, but Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Fulham underlined the scale of the task ahead.\n\nThe 41-year-old described his appointment as \"one of the proudest moments of his life\", yet the reality was clear as Chelsea dropped out of the Premier League top five for the first time since August.\n\nSitting in the directors' box alongside co-owner Behdad Eghbali and members of the sporting leadership team, Rosenior watched as the side he has inherited slipped to eighth.\n\nHe replaced Enzo Maresca after the Italian fell out with the Blues hierarchy, with Rosenior joining from French club Strasbourg who share Chelsea's owners.\n\nThose decision-makers were targeted by chants from the away end during the match at Fulham, while the Chelsea players struggled against their west London rivals on the pitch.\n\nChelsea have won just one of their past nine league games and two of 11 in all competitions, falling from potential title contenders in November to a side now lagging far behind.\n\nThey have ground to make up to achieve their minimum aim this season – qualifying for the Champions League, which should be achievable with a top-five finish.\n\nBBC Sport looks at the problems Rosenior faces on and off the pitch.\n\nListen: Football Daily - The Debrief\n\nIf Chelsea's relationship with the fans isn't broken, it is certainly fraying.\n\nJust hours after Rosenior was confirmed in his new post, the Chelsea Supporters' Trust released a highly critical survey - not aimed at the appointment, but at the club's leadership.\n\nAmong the headlines was that more than half of respondents doubt Chelsea will achieve success in the next three to five years under the current regime. A similar proportion lack confidence in the ownership's decision-making.\n\nRosenior seemed aware of the stakes. In his first interview with the club's media channels, he used the word 'win' 14 times - a clear signal that he understands the only way to repair this fractured relationship is through results.\n\nThe former Fulham defender also referenced playing against Didier Drogba, Arjen Robben, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and Michael Essien - acknowledging the fear factor Chelsea once commanded during the Roman Abramovich ownership era. These were savvy remarks from the London-born coach, showing he understands the club's identity.\n\nYet even he may not grasp the depth of anger that exists among the fanbase. On Wednesday, chants in support of the sanctioned Russian oligarch who transformed Chelsea rang out across Stamford Bridge, alongside unsavoury songs aimed at co-controlling owner Eghbali and Clearlake Capital.\n\nThere will also be a protest before Rosenior's first league match against Brentford, who leapfrogged them in the table on Wednesday, on Saturday week.\n\nRosenior must know he could become a target himself if results do not come quickly. He embodies everything Todd Boehly and Clearlake believe in: he is young, progressive, and connected to their multi-club model via Strasbourg.\n\nSigning off his first interview, Rosenior said: \"Believe in what is an amazing football club, believe in the players, and when you give energy to the team, you help them win. That's why we are here. I can't wait to meet them and do that soon.\"\n\nChelsea have spent more than £1.5bn on new players since 2022. Although they have raised over £750m through player sales, results have not matched the scale of investment.\n\nMuch of the criticism has focused on the club assembling the youngest squad in the Premier League, with an average starting XI aged under 24. No team that young has ever won the title in the Premier League era.\n\nChelsea have shown flashes of quality but often lose control and drop points. Former boss Maresca highlighted the issue after his side dropped a league-high 15 points from winning positions this season.\n\nRosenior faces similar concerns. His Strasbourg team, with an average age of around 21, dropped 13 points from winning positions and won only two of their past 10 Ligue 1 matches.\n\nInsiders at Chelsea insist they want to be Champions League regulars and eventually challenge for the biggest titles. Yet to achieve even their minimum aims, Chelsea and Rosenior need to find momentum quickly.\n\nChelsea were reduced to 10 men at Fulham when Marc Cucurella was sent off for pulling back Harry Wilson as he broke through on goal.\n\nWilson later scored the winner with a fine finish in the 82nd minute.\n\nCaretaker manager Calum McFarlane defended Cucurella by saying: \"There's been a lot made of the red cards this season. I don't think this one is ill-disciplined. This is football. You get caught one-v-one and Marc is one of the best defenders in the world.\"\n\nHowever, McFarlane admitted concern over three yellow cards that followed immediately for dissent after the dismissal, shown to Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Tosin Adarabioyo.\n\n\"The three yellow cards directly after is something we'll have to look at, but I would argue that we don't want that to happen,\" McFarlane said.\n\nMcFarlane was also later cautioned for questioning the referee.\n\nSince the start of the 2023-24 season, Chelsea have received 251 yellow cards and 11 reds – the most of any Premier League club. They have had five red cards for players in the league this season, and one \n\nFormer boss Maresca had been trying to address the issue before his departure.\n\n'A moving moment' as Rosenior breaks barriers\n\n'It means the world to me' - Chelsea appoint Rosenior\n\nWilson downs Chelsea in front of new boss Rosenior\n\nRosenior joined team meetings before the Fulham match and travelled with the squad to Craven Cottage.\n\nHis first full training session is scheduled for Thursday. He will then be presented to the media on Friday before selecting his first team for Saturday's FA Cup third-round game at Charlton Athletic.\n\nIn the following week, Chelsea face Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-final, followed by Rosenior's first Premier League match at home to Brentford.\n\nThe Debrief: Semenyo leaves Bournemouth in style, Newcastle score the latest-ever winner and six other PL games\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "The Wasatch Mountain Range of the Greater Rockies will serve as the backdrop for the 2027 NHL Winter Classic. University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium will be the site of the league's signature regular-season event, which the Utah Mammoth will host in the franchise's third season.\n\nThe Mammoth will welcome the Colorado Avalanche in a college football venue that seats approximately 51,400 on a fall Saturday in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe date of the game has yet to be finalized, but NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Mammoth owners Ryan and Ashley Smith revealed the matchup Wednesday, along with Mammoth center Logan Cooley.\n\nLogan Cooley on getting to play in the 2027 Winter Classic at Rice-Eccles Stadium: pic.twitter.com/SduTSBg5ah\n\n— Jenna Fink (@jennamfink) January 7, 2026\n\nThe Mammoth, who formed after the Arizona Coyotes were dissolved in April 2024, are currently in their second season.\n\nAfter an 8-2 start to the season, they're now 20-20-3 and in fourth place of the Central Division with 43 points.\n\nThis season, the Mammoth still have one more head-to-head meeting versus the Avalanche, who are the division leaders with a 31-4-7 record. Colorado is also atop the Western Conference at the moment with 69 points.\n\nThe Mammoth and Avalanche have met six times over the past two seasons, with Colorado holding a five-point advantage over Utah in the series. Their lone remaining matchup during the 2025-26 season is on Feb. 25 in Utah.\n\nNext season's Winter Classic will mark the Avalanche's fourth appearance in an outdoor game. Utah, on the other hand, will soon become the 32nd NHL franchise to play in an outdoor game.\n\nThe Classic started as an annual tradition on Jan. 1, 2008. At the time, the Buffalo Sabres played the Pittsburgh Penguins at what was then known as Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, home of the NFL's Buffalo Bills.\n\nThis year's Winter Classic was held Jan. 2 at the Miami Marlins' loanDepot Park. The New York Rangers defeated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers 5-1.\n\nIt was the fifth straight Classic at a baseball stadium.\n\nThat streak will end next season in Salt Lake City, where the University of Utah's campus will take center stage, as Rice-Eccles becomes the fourth college football stadium to host the event.\n\nNotably, Rice-Eccles also put on the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics. It's scheduled to fulfill the same role when the Games return to Utah in 2034.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have smashed preseason expectations in head coach Mike Vrabel’s first year.\n\nThey secured the AFC’s No. 2 seed and will host the Los Angeles Chargers at Gillette Stadium in the Wildcard round on Sunday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it will be second-year quarterback Drake Maye’s NFL postseason debut. But it will be far from Maye’s first truly meaningful game.\n\nIn 2022, the then-20-year-old quarterback squared off with the college football juggernauts that are the Clemson Tigers in the ACC Conference Championship game.\n\nIt was Maye’s sophomore year at the University of North Carolina, and he had brought the Tar Heels to a 9-3 record and a top-25 ranking.\n\nMaye was asked during his Wednesday afternoon press conference what he learned from that experience.\n\n“Maybe a little bit,” Maye said when asked if that college experience correlates to his NFL playoff debut. “Getting back to trying to play for championships… I think it’s a little bit different in the NFL.\n\n“Just the mentality of ‘win or go home’ or ‘win and advance,’ and I think that’s the biggest thing that’s different. In the ACC Championship, you go to a bowl game. Here it’s (win) now, or you’re going home.”\n\nMaye was unable to win the conference championship in 2022, and, as he alluded to, earned a second chance in a game against Bo Nix’s 15th-ranked Oregon Ducks.\n\nMaye threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns in the 2022 Holiday Bowl. He led his team to a 24-10 fourth-quarter lead and added three points on his final drive of the game.\n\nThe defense was unable to stop the Ducks’ two-minute drill as Nix threw the game-winning touchdown with 19 seconds on the clock and beat the Tar Heels 28-27.\n\nDrake Maye Silences Emerging Narrative About Patriots-Chargers Matchup",

One of them involved the scenario of James departing via trade, something that the longtime agent shut down due to the star's own stance.\n\nMORE: Lakers' LeBron James sends five-word message to Bronny James after monster G-League dunk\n\n“He can’t be traded unless he wants to be traded.

Staying with the Lakers, especially as he goes through the final year of his contract before entering the 2026 offseason as an unrestricted free agent, will pave the way for Paul to have a major role in negotiations.\n\nRegardless of what happens in the near future for James, he will have the best representation by his side with Paul helping him along the way.\n\nLakers’ JJ Redick details how he optimizes LeBron James at his old age\n\nFormer All-Star and LeBron James opponent can’t believe Lakers star is still doing this\n\nLakers' LeBron James addresses offensive fit with Luka Doncic, shuts down continued rumors",

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs will have an excellent opportunity to revamp their roster during the 2026 NFL Draft, starting with the No. 9 pick in the Annual Selection Meeting's first round.\n\nIt has been nearly a decade since Kansas City has picked in the top-10, and with plenty of needs to fill in the coming offseason, Chiefs general manager Brett Veach will need to be judicious with his selections to get his team back into the playoffs.\n\nTake a look at this seven-round mock draft, which projects that Kansas City's front office will target offensive skill positions before addressing its defensive needs:\n\nThe Chiefs waste no time finding an exciting playmaker to help Patrick Mahomes. Tate will be one of the first pass-catchers off the board, and could be exactly the kind of dynamic route-runner that Kansas City needs to reinvent its air attack.\n\nJohnson would immediately be able to take over as the Chiefs' leading rusher to bring some 'juice' to the ground game that Kansas City has sorely missed in the past few seasons.\n\nThis might not be the most exciting pick, but Orange — nicknamed 'Big Citrus' — is exactly the kind of run-stuffer that the Chiefs need in the middle of their defensive line.\n\nKansas City selected Nohl Williams out of Cal last year, and takes Masses here in the fourth round to add another former Golden Bear ball-hawk on Day 3.\n\nGiven that the Chiefs ended the season with their third-string quarterback under center, it seems logical that Kansas City might decide to invest a pick at the position this year. Allar was once considered one of the most exciting quarterback prospects in college football, and joins the Chiefs in Round 5 to become Patrick Mahomes' long-term understudy.\n\nAfter addressing wide receiver and running back early, Kansas City targets Gyllenborg to round out its selections of offensive skill position players.\n\nTapp tallied 12 tackles for loss and 7.5 sacks in 2025 and joins the Chiefs as a developmental prospect who could potentially help bolster the edges of Kansas City's defensive line.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL Draft: Chiefs take WR, RB early in this seven round mock",

    "fullText": "Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre said Wednesday that anyone who says he has thrown in the towel on his battle with Parkinson's disease is spreading fake news.\n\n\"Thank you everyone for your prayers and concerns, but contrary to reports, I have not given up hope in my battle with Parkinson’s!\" the 56-year-old Super Bowl champion wrote on X. \"Not sure where this came from — but just like I never gave up on the gridiron — not going to start now. I pray there will be a cure one day and I appreciate you all.\"\n\nFavre also told TMZ on Wednesday: \"I have absolutely not given up and I am fighting till the end. Yes I have progressed a little faster than I would have hoped at this point but I’m extremely thankful and blessed!!!\"\n\nThe former Packers/Jets/Vikings quarterback revealed his Parkinson's diagnosis last year but hadn't gone into much detail about it until last week's episode of his \"4th and Favre\" podcast.\n\nOn the podcast, Favre sounds like he's trying to be realistic about his condition while also remaining hopeful.\n\n“As you well know, there’s no cure,\" Favre said. \"I hear from time to time, ‘Well, they’re five years away from a cure.’ You know, I hope that that’s the case. I really do. But I’m not holding my breath.\"\n\nHe mentioned Michael J. Fox and Muhammad Ali as people who \"have really set the bar high on Parkinson’s and treatments and things of that nature.\"\n\n\"And I’m sure that when they were diagnosed, they thought, ‘Well, they’ll have a cure in five years. I’ll be fine,’\" Favre said. \"Well, that’s not the case. So, I’m optimistic, but again, I’m not holding my breath.”\n\nFavre's comments on Wednesday may have been in response to a recent online article that seemed to interpret his podcast remarks in a different way than he intended.\n\nAlso on the podcast, Favre said he's in the early stages of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which is the most common type of the disorder. He said his major symptoms are \"rigidity and stiffness,\" which is worst in the morning before he takes his medication and has particularly affected his right side.\n\nFavre added that he occasionally experiences shaking but has not had any memory loss issues.\n\n“All in all, I’m pretty good,\" he said. \"I would say I’ve progressed maybe a little. ... If you dropped a dime on the floor in front of me and I reached down with my right hand, I may for five minutes try to pick up that dime and eventually just grab it with my left hand. Initially when I would take the medicine, my dexterity in my right hand was pretty smooth. But that’s not the case anymore.\n\n“So that’s one of the reasons I think I may have progressed a little bit. Hopefully not. Maybe it’s I’m looking into something more than it really is, but all in all, again I’m very blessed and thankful.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Kings captain is the latest in a high-profile list of partners and investors in the high-tech SoCal golf team.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles Kings center and captain Anže Kopitar will retire at the end of the 2025-26 season and like many retirees he’ll be devoting his time to a different passion: golf.\n\nKopitar is the newest investor and limited partner in the Los Angeles Golf Club, one of five teams in the TGL golf league, a newly formed team golf league in its second season that hosts matches inside an arena and features a fusion of virtual courses and high-tech, rotating greens that aims to attract a new generation of golfing fans and provide an innovative arena experience.\n\n“Myself being a pretty passionate golfer and really loving the game, following stuff and seeing the TGL getting some traction and how fun it was to watch, I didn't really think about getting the opportunity, but when the opportunity presents itself, I just kind of jumped on it,” Kopitar said.\n\nThe Kings captain said that he was approached by LAGC president Neil Hubman about becoming an investor and he was eager to be on board.\n\nKopitar’s personal experience with golf is uniquely tied to his time in Los Angeles. Hailing from Slovenia, he didn’t have much experience with golf growing up, but after his decades-long transplant to sunny SoCal, he found himself playing it more and more, especially in charity games put on by the Kings.\n\nThe competitive drive that has made him one of the best hockey players of his generation also played into getting him into golf  as well after a disappointing charity tournament performance left a sour taste in his mouth.\n\n“I wasn't really into it until I severely embarrassed myself my second year on that charity golf tournament. So I figured I’d just work at it a little bit. And then I hit the seven iron right in the sweet spot and then I was hooked,” Kopitar said.\n\nKopitar joins an investor group that includes several other notable athletes and figures in entertainment like primary owners Alexis Ohanian, Serena Williams and Venus Williams and an extended investor group that includes Giannis Antetokounmpo, Alex Morgan and Shonda Rhimes.\n\nWhile he plans to move his family back home to Slovenia when the NHL season is done, taking a stake in LAGC gives Kopitar and his family a new way to stay connected to the community that he’s called his home and left his mark on for two decades.\n\n“It'll be a great excuse for me to come here and see everybody and be a part of this community like I've been for 20 years… Both of my kiddos were born here. We have friends outside of hockey here. Now this thing that popped up with LA Golf Club,” Kopitar said. “It’ll be very fun to come back here and maybe not be as stressed as I am during the season.\"\n\nLAGC's season kicked off with a Jan. 2 match against Boston Common Golf at SoFi Center in Palm Springs, Fla. that ended in a 7-5 victory for Boston Common, the first match of many that Kopitar will have the chance to watch as a new member of the organization.\n\n“Anže represents everything we value at LAGC, elite competition, leadership and a deep connection to Los Angeles. He’s a world-class athlete, a passionate golfer, and someone who understands what it means to represent this city at the highest level. We’re proud to welcome him into our investor group.” Hubman said in LAGC’s official announcement.",

    "title": "Did Real Madrid Figure Something Out Against Real Betis?",
    "description": "It’s possible they did, but Atletico could end that mini honeymoon quick",
    "fullText": "These observations — where I look at Real Madrid’s history, its players on loan, Castilla, tactical tidbits, and other relevant thoughts — are now a regular thing. All previous editions can be found here.\n\nI was asked on a recent Q&A, “if Xabi Alonso were to turn it around and win the Champions League this season, would it be a bigger feat than the 2022 Champions League triumph?”\n\nI had to think about it, and I still don’t have a clear cut answer. I lean towards a hypothetical 2026 Champions League triumph being a bigger achievement than the 2022 one, but only because of how improbable a 180-turnaround from the team seems now, given how gloomy things have been.\n\nBut then I remembered: In 2022, I wrote a column in the winter, on Real Madrid still being able to win the Champions League despite how bad they’ve been. The article was generally laughed at and dismissed. That team was not good enough, they said. Impossible — especially after getting played off the park, barely crossing the half-way line in a loss to PSG in Paris of the first of the Champions League round-of-16. Months later, Real Madrid lifted the Champions League trophy.\n\nThen I remembered another thing: I have an annual article, around this time — completely unintentional — talking about the same thing: ‘Real Madrid have been bad, but they generally don’t find themselves until the spring time’. In each case, it’s never well received.\n\nThis Real Madrid team has instilled little belief in fans, and even the biggest optimist would find it hard to believe in a turnaround. The regression is real. The promise from the Club World Cup, and early returns this season, have vanished. The press has regressed; the confidence zapped. Thibaut Courtois was taking naps earlier this season — now he’s back to being the team’s best player far too often. Alonso has compromised his original ideas in order to meet the players half way. He has lost himself, and it’s going to be hard to go back to his roots now.\n\nReal Madrid’s history cares little for any of this analysis. They would read these words of pessimism and light them on fire. This club is all about adversity and overcoming it. Nothing has ever come easy. In 2022, up until Real Madrid’s loss in Paris, the team looked dead, nowhere close to the elites. This particular team looks even worse. At least that one had Toni Kroos, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric still at their apex. This current team is largely inexperienced, and even among the veterans — apart from Courtois and Carvajal — there is a lack of leadership.\n\nThere is also an important detail that exists this season that didn’t exist in 2022: Xabi Alonso’s job could be over mid-January. The Spanish SuperCopa in Saudi Arabia is a huge litmus test for the Board, and unfortunately for Alonso, Real Madrid have to face two very dangerous teams: A team that is built to beat them (Atletico Madrid), and if they pass that test, they move on to the final to face a team, Barcelona, that is blood-thirsty for revenge.\n\nReal Madrid have not dealt well against teams with high intensity.\n\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find the last time the team put in a good performance for the entirety of 90 minutes. There are spurts of individual brilliance and heroics, but little to gloat about in terms of team chemistry and consistency. The team is in survival mode — reacting to things minute-to-minute among chaos. There is no dominance, no imposition of will. The result, overall, haven’t been great — the process is even worse.\n\nThe issues earlier on in the season are different than the issues now. In September, the team pressed well, created an abundance of chances, and couldn’t convert those forays to build a sizeable lead heading into the second half when the legs tired and the team regressed into a lower block. The morale was mostly good, and trending north.\n\nThings are more leg-heavy now, players are unhappy with their roles, and perhaps too eager to make use of the limited time they have not knowing when their next appearance might be. There is more pressure on the stars to float above, more pressure on the role players to produce in limited cameos, and more pressure on the coach to win. Two possible outcomes: The pressure cuts diamonds, or gives way to collapse.\n\nThere is a path to redemption. Not all is lost. If the glass half-empty look exists, there is also a glass half-full outlook: Real Madrid are hit with injuries to key players: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao. Eduardo Camavinga has barely played due to his health. Carvajal may return as early as the Super Cup (but that in itself is a problem if he’s rushed back). If the board can be patient enough for important defensive figures to return to stabilize the backline and bring some leadership, they can buy time for a possible spring rejuvenation.\n\nAlso, what if Real Madrid does win the Spanish SuperCup? How much momentum will that give them? Enough to launch them into orbit and escape the noise? Is such a thing improbable? Have we not learned enough lessons doubting Real Madrid by now over the past 50 years? Is that naive?\n\nThey still might be the best team in Spain when all is said and done. They still have the league’s best players. Tactically and collectively, they are still off pace from the elite: Arsenal, Bayern Munich, PSG — and possibly others. In the last two months, they’re dropped off even below the B-tier teams.\n\nBut it’s true the surrounding pieces around the young, inexperienced nucleus probably doesn’t have what it takes. Despite Mbappe’s devastating offensive form, Bellingham at his best, Gonzalo levitating against Real Betis, and Rodrygo rising, there is little confidence in the team’s two-way balance. Some of the midfield muscle has gotten stabilizing Eduardo Camavinga, rather than Arda Güler, supporting Jude Bellingham in midfield, but Camavinga also needs to stay fit — his health could swing the balance in a positive way. If both Güler and Camavinga are fit, I would wager Alonso bets on Camavinga for balance purposes in most games.\n\nBut even banking on good health is naive. When one key player returns, another key player is sidelined. Kylian Mbappe’s most recent injury is horrible news given how much the team relies on his pace in transition as well as his finishing and playmaking.\n\nIt’s an abysmally bad season when it comes to goal-scoring, even with Mbappe. Before the Real Betis game it was asked: how bad can it get without him? Before the win over the weekend, the team had only scored 36 goals from an xG of 45.2. It’s a painful number when you compare it to Barcelona’s up until the new year: 51 goals scored from an xG of 47.65. Only one team, Rayo Vallecano, has underperformed their xG even worse. In the Champions League, the numbers are a bit better: 13 goals from an xG of 13. Alonso will hope the league numbers will normalize.\n\nThe defensive numbers aren’t more encouraging. Despite conceding just 16 goals before Christmas, they conceded an xGA of 22.21. It was not good defense that had shut opponents out — it was Thibaut Courtois.\n\nA lot of that goes back to issues from seasons’ prior: the first line of defense has been catastrophic. Despite the pressing trending in a positive direction earlier this season (games against Marseille and Barcelona at home come to mind), it’s got dialled back to an unrecognizable level.\n\nIt’s hard to put into words what’s happenning here:\n\npic.twitter.com/dRSccNQS5u https://t.co/SHMnjN01CH\n\n— Managing Madrid (@managingmadrid) December 28, 2025\n\nThat’s Rodrygo doing everything he physically can. These are fundamentals: A press requires everyone to pull their weight. If there isn’t 100% buy in, you can’t hold a high line:\n\nRecurring thing in the last 2 months: back-line completely out of sync with where they stand, when to step, and when to keep their line. Wasn't as magnified when the press was working earlier this season. Now that the press is gone, you see more of thispic.twitter.com/ztjkcZvmKR\n\n— Kiyan Sobhani (@KiyanSo) January 1, 2026\n\nMore problems arise when the team is facing high pressure. The absences of Trent, Militao, and Carvajal haven’t helped, but the problems also run deeper. Players often make the wrong off-ball runs, show in the wrong areas, make the wrong pass, or delay the pass when quicker build-up is needed:\n\nThere are a couple situations in this clip where Trent would help. pic.twitter.com/mfWssfrmRF https://t.co/q5tbD8jIx7\n\n— Kiyan Sobhani (@KiyanSo) January 5, 2026\n\nThose build-up issues need to be sorted. By now, in an ideal world, Xabi Alonso’s blueprint would’ve been well-marinated into a machine that baits presses and exploits the space in behind, with plenty of attacking weapons to help Real Madrid punish teams who dare to push bodies forward.\n\nThe build-up will become even more strenuous on Thursday against Atletico Madrid. Diego Simeone’s men are masters at hoodwinking you into thinking a passing lane is open. They congest the strong side, invite a switch, and rotate so quickly defensively, you’ll lose the outlet before it even appears.\n\nAnd that’s where Real Madrid will be tested perhaps the most all month, and the Real Betis honeymoon could soon end. There is perhaps no greater thorn in Real Madrid’s side than Atleti — a team whose hearts Real Madrid have shattered on the biggest stage over and over again, but a team that can close space and irritate like no other.\n\nBut it’s also an opportunity to carry the momentum from the Betis game, ride the Gonzalo Garcia heatwave, and carry that energy forward to the Super Cup Final and beyond.\n\nReal Madrid lose a lot without Mbappe, who is probably the best player in the world. There is no discussion about whether or not Mbappe helps the team. However, Real Madrid do gain two things with Gonzalo Garcia starting in lieu of the injured French Superstar: A better first line of defense, and a target in the box.\n\nReal Madrid will need both those things. Atletico Madrid would rather not have their center-backs — of late David Hancko and Marc Pubill — occupied. Gonzalo commands gravity and is an expert off-ball mover in the box. Real Madrid can leverage that skill into creating space for others — Rodrygo making diagonal runs in the box, Jude Bellingham crashing it, Vinicius Jr cutting in.\n\nReal Madrid can stifle Atletico’s build-up, spearheaded by Gonzalo’s effort:\n\nReal Madrid may be better off with only one of Vinicius or Mbappe on the field; pairing one of them with a more natural link-up striker (Gonzalo) that they can play off of. The sample size of Gonzalo plus one of them (mostly Vinicius due to Mbappe’s injuries in the Club World Cup and now), is small, but mostly effective. The sample size with Vinicus and Mbappe together is much larger, but not clicking as it should be. We have virtually zero sample size of Gonzalo and Mbappe together, but it would be fascinating to see a theoretical partnership with them to see what they could cook. Mbappe likes to hang back and receive cut-backs; Gonzalo likes to shake off his marker and attack the six-yard box — that would create space for Mbappe and pull defenders around. That kind of offense doesn’t exist if Gonzalo isn’t on the field.\n\nIt is true that Real Madrid have struggles outside their front line. The defense has looked frail dancing on the high line, and the midfield has gotten overrun more than once. But the problems do, in a lot of ways, start up top — the midfield will always be outnumbered by opponents if the first line of defense is broken. That’s where you can make the case for more Gonzalo and more Rodrygo to balance the team. Valverde’s eventual return to midfield with Carvajal and Trent coming back should help Bellingham, Tchouameni, and Camavinga as well.\n\nBut Alonso can address those questions in the Super Cup Final (if Real Madrid qualify) and beyond. The attack and line-up against Atletico picks itself: copy and pasted from the win over Betis. There is one slight question mark: Dean Huijsen, who is back with the team. But logic suggests Huijsen would not be ready to start a game of this magnitude as his first game back, especially after he struggled with Atletico’s high press in the 5 – 2 debacle earlier this season.\n\n“I think every match has to be analysed, but all defeats, if anything, can teach us more positive lessons,” Alonso said in Wednesday’s pre-game press conference. “There are things we don’t want to repeat from that match, things that we obviously took away from it, but I’m very convinced that it’s going to be different. We mustn’t forget the things that didn’t work well either.”\n\nAtletico are struggling since that 5 – 2 Derby — but they were struggling in the build-up to that game as well. They had gone winless against Espanyol, Elche, Alaves, Liverpool, and Mallorca. Antoine Griezmann hadn’t scored a goal for 22 consecutive matches. But then Griezmann scored against Real Madrid, Atletico pounded Real Madrid on set-pieces and crosses, and pressed them relentlessly.\n\nThis time it’s Julian Alvarez’s turn to go through a drought (he’s scored just one goal since that aforementioned Derby), and Atletico are coming off a poor showing against Real Sociedad. Pablo Barrios, their most important midfielder this season, is injured. Atletico are also defanged away from home (they’ve earned just 13 points out of a possible 30 this season away from the Metropolitano).\n\nStill — you know that all goes out the window on Thursday. Atletico will be blood-hungry, as they always are against Real Madrid — and if Real Madrid don’t exceed that intensity, it’s going to be tough to win a must-win Derby.",

    "fullText": "The crypto market was spared a blow this week after indexing giant MSCI opted not to delist crypto holding companies from its indexes.\n\nMSCI decided not to proceed with a proposal to exclude digital asset treasuries from its indexes, though it said it would conduct a wider review of how some companies are treated.\n\nThe move spares companies like Strategy and other firms whose main business is buying and holding crypto from a potentially devastating blow. If MSCI dumped those stocks, many investors who track its indexes would have likely followed suit. However, it leaves the door open to a crackdown in the future.\n\nStrategy stock spiked as much as 5% on the news.\n\nWhen the MSCI first said it was considering excluding firms with 50% or more assets in crypto, the idea sparked strong backlash from the industry. MSCI's argument was that crypto treasuries are more like investment funds than operating companies, and should be treated differently for the purposes of inclusion in some of its world indexes.\n\nFrank Chaparro, head of content at crypto market maker GSR, said that the updates is a subtle but important developement for the crypto market, which is still fragile following the market meltdown sent prices plummeting in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"As leverage unwound and sentiment around these structures deteriorated, weakness in DAT equities spilled over into broader crypto risk appetite,\" he told Business Insider. \"Against that backdrop, any credible bullish catalyst for the space, particularly one tied to index inclusion and institutional access, carries outsized signaling value right now.\"\n\nChaparro added that while many exchange platforms offer investors the opportunity to purchase crypto, the majority of traders still opt to gain exposure through funds and other index-linked products.\n\nThat said, MSCI signaled that it plans to embark on a broader consultation over how \"non-operating companies\" should be treated. Another bout of uncertainty related to indexing could create fresh headwinds for Strategy and other companies that hoard crypto on their balance sheets.\n\nChaparro said that he thinks this strong scrutiny on the part of the index is justified, highlighting the importance of holding DATs to high standards\n\n\"Companies that function more like investment funds than operating businesses with bitcoin as a core treasury asset should be evaluated differently and potentially excluded,\" he said. \"Clear and consistent criteria will be essential to preserve index integrity as these structures proliferate.\"",

I knew we'd be best friends.\n\nAs we began to get to know each other, both of us keen to \"dig deep\" and understand each other as fully as possible, we would often say things like, \"To understand this part of me, you need some context.\"\n\nAlthough we would have liked to jump into each other's histories, we were limited by time constraints.\n\nI work full-time, volunteer, own a house, participate heavily in church activities, and have family and friends I'm already committed to. Eloisa has a husband and is a full-time student. We're both very busy people, but we're keen to connect on a deeper level because neither of us wants coffee-once-a-month friendships.\n\nIn your late teens and early 20s, forming friendships is relatively easy, as people often have less responsibility and more time. But the older you get, the harder it can be to form meaningful relationships — because there are only so many hours in a day. And yet, when you meet friends at an older age, there is so much more life to catch up on, just not the time to do it.\n\nI'd seen on social media a trending way to get to know friends as adults — presentation evenings. Each person involved gives a short presentation about themselves, which may include both serious and humorous topics.\n\nTypically, people create slideshows with lots of pictures to accompany whatever is being presented. I'd seen a huge range of topics: what's my love language, favorite books, favorite memories, teenage years, and the list of ideas for these nights goes on and on.\n\nExcited about the possibility, I asked Eloisa if she'd be up for it, and as I suspected, she couldn't wait.\n\nFor our first presentation night, we decided to kick off our monthly series by sharing stories about our childhoods.\n\nJust the process of preparing my slideshow was precious. I went through dozens of photos of my family, reflecting on the significant changes I experienced as a child, and remembering how fortunate I was to grow up in such a close-knit family with my parents and three siblings.\n\nWe planned to present after dinner one evening, both allowing each other to share without interruption.\n\nWhen I'm typically getting to know a friend just through conversation, both of us are lovingly interrupting each other, interjecting thoughts in response to what the other person has said. But in presenting, you're quiet when it isn't your turn, so the listener has a chance to fully absorb what the other person says.\n\nI listened to Eloise speak about her childhood, and I immediately could piece together why she is the way she is because of her history.\n\nWhen I presented, I methodically talked about my birthday, my parents, my siblings, and how I had lived in several houses in multiple countries.\n\nIt was a lighthearted theme, but even so, she now understands why stability is so important to me, and why I tend to crave acceptance from people. A lot of that is down to my childhood.\n\nAs a visual learner, I found the presentation night so helpful in remembering the people Eloise spoke about. So now, when she tells me about her sister, I can visualize her sister and recall Eloise's relationship with her growing up. Facts about Eloise get ingrained in my memory because I've had photos and so much context.\n\nI expect that as we hold these presentation nights more frequently — we're hoping to do them monthly — we'll get to know each other better, both on a serious and a silly level.\n\nAs we continue to be friends, carrying on with these presentations, we'll understand each other's triggers more and be able to respond better and give informed advice.\n\nIt's the first time I've had presentation nights with a friend, but I suspect I'll bring in other friends to join us on our evenings. I also think it would be a really helpful thing to do with a boyfriend or partner in the future.\n\nThe fact that Eloise wanted to have these presentation nights with me felt like a privilege, because it's someone who wants to know me and invest in our friendship.\n\nTo be known and feel seen is one of the greatest desires we have a humans, and these presentations provide a way to do this in our busy, modern, adulting worlds.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump took a big swing at business on Wednesday — saying he would put a stop to practices he deemed undesirable at defense firms and large housing investors.\n\nIn a series of posts on Truth Social, the president said he wants to ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes in the US. He also criticized defense firms' issuing dividends, stock buybacks, and \"exorbitant\" pay packages — and called out Raytheon by name. The market reacted quickly: Shares for private equity firm Blackstone and defense stocks dropped immediately following Trump's posts.\n\nWednesday evening, Trump issued an executive order aimed at defense firms, stating, \"Effective immediately, they are not permitted in any way, shape, or form to pay dividends or buy back stock, until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\nIt's the latest example of Trump taking steps to insert himself into business, having taken equity stakes in several companies over the last year. (See Business Insider's new series on \"The Future of Capitalism.)\n\nMany housing economists agree that banning large investors from buying or owning single-family homes would likely do little nationally to improve housing affordability, which has deteriorated in large part because of a shortage of homes. \n\n\"If we actually wanted to solve that problem, bringing down the cost of home ownership, what we should be doing is increasing the supply of housing,\" Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, told Business Insider.\n\nBusiness Insider's James Rodriguez has reported that, despite being the \"villains\" of the housing market, large investors don't actually own a significant portion of America's homes.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors with at least 10 units in their portfolio owned roughly 3.4% of all single-family homes in the country. Big investors with at least 1,000 units — a group that includes major companies such as AMH Homes, Invitation Homes, Tricon Residential, and Pretium — owned just 0.73% of units.\n\nThat share is much higher in certain housing markets, particularly in the southeast.\n\nIt's unclear if Trump will be able to stop future payouts from defense firms. The one he singled out, Raytheon, for example, announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023, and said it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.\n\nIn his posts, Trump said Raytheon \"has been the least responsive,\" \"the slowest,\" and the \"most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military.\"\n\nOf defense firms overall, he said that until they build \"NEW and MODERN Production Plants\" their executives' pay should be capped at $5 million.",

    "description": "Amazon updates its performance review system to require corporate employees share specific work achievements.",
    "fullText": "Amazon has a new question for its corporate workforce: What did you get done last year?\n\nAs part of this year's performance review process, known internally as Forte, Amazon is asking corporate employees to submit three to five \"accomplishments\" that best reflect their work, according to people familiar with the matter and an internal guideline obtained by Business Insider.\n\nEmployees are required to provide \"specific examples\" of what they delivered, along with actions they plan to take to continue growing at the company, the guideline added.\n\n\"Accomplishments are specific projects, goals, initiatives, or process improvements that show the impact of your work,\" the internal guideline states. \"Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn't lead to the results you hoped for.\"\n\nThis marks the first time Amazon has explicitly formalized Forte around individual accomplishments, according to the people. They asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.\n\nWhile the company has long included a self-assessment component, past reviews asked employees broader questions about their \"super powers,\" areas of interest, and questions like, \"When you're at your best, how do you contribute?\" An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nForte is a key driver of employee compensation. Managers also consider peer feedback, adherence to Amazon's Leadership Principles, and job-specific skills to assign an \"Overall Value\" rating, which determines annual pay.\n\nThe move reflects Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's continued push to build a more disciplined workforce and a more unified corporate culture. Last year, he enforced a full return-to-office policy, cut management layers, and overhauled Amazon's pay model and performance review process to more clearly reward top performers.\n\nThis is part of a broader change in how tech companies treat employees. After years of mollycoddling talent, the industry has become tougher. Elon Musk started this in 2022, by demanding to know what Twitter employees accomplished each week. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed suit with his year of intensity. Even Google has toughened up.\n\nSome teams at Amazon, including the advertising and the IMDb video units, began pilot-testing a similar Forte question a few years ago. At the time, advertising chief Paul Kotas told employees that sharing specific accomplishments \"helps facilitate a more productive\" conversation with managers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Kennedy said his new guidelines undo previous advice. Full fat dairy is back, sugar is out, and highly processed foods come under fire.",
    "fullText": "That's the stated intention of the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, released Wednesday by the federal government.\n\n\"Real food is back at the center of the American diet,\" a video from the Department of Health and Human Services says, on the government's new realfood.gov website.\n\nThe federal guidelines, which are updated every five years, serve as a guidepost for nutrition and health advice and form the basis for federal food programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, as well as meals and snacks for the military, veterans, and preschoolers in Head Start.\n\nThe new realfood.gov site claims that Americans have been \"misled\" by previous guidelines, an idea that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. echoed Wednesday at the White House.\n\n\"The hard truth is that our government has been lying to us to protect corporate profit-taking, telling us that these food-like substances were beneficial to public health,\" he said. \"These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation's food culture and Make America Healthy Again.\"\n\nIn 1992, the food pyramid was introduced into the guidelines, encouraging bread and pasta to form the basis of the American diet:\n\nThe original food pyramid has been heavily criticized for being too cozy with food lobbyists, particularly in the grains industry, as it prioritized more bread, cereal, rice, and pasta than sound nutrition advice would recommend.\n\nIt was replaced in 2011 by \"My Plate,\" a new framework meant to simplify how people thought about building their daily meals. Vegetables, protein, and grains were prominent on the plate, with an emphasis on consuming more whole grains:\n\nUnder Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" campaign, a new upside-down pyramid was unveiled on Wednesday:\n\nThe new pyramid deliberately de-prioritizes whole grains by flipping the triangle upside down — even though it's not a true inversion of the old pyramid, which had \"bad\" ingredients, like sweets, fats, and oils, at the top.\n\nThe new pyramid has as its cornerstone protein and \"healthy\" fat, which Kennedy said \"are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines.\"\n\nFor the first time, the new guidelines encourage people to prioritize \"high-quality, nutrient-dense\" protein at each meal.\n\nAnimal sources are recommended, such as eggs, poultry, seafood, and red meat, even though most nutritionists would encourage a focus on lean proteins like chicken, fish, and plants like beans, nuts, and seeds, with less red meat.\n\nThe daily protein serving goal, at 1.2-1.6 grams per kilogram of your body weight, is generally in line with what dietitians and protein experts recommend. For example, a 150-pound person would be aiming for about 82 to 109 grams of protein every day on this plan, far more than previous guidelines would suggest.\n\n\"We are ending the war on saturated fats,\" Kennedy said Wednesday.\n\nThe new guidelines encourage consumers to \"include full-fat dairy,\" which is a somewhat controversial stance among nutritionists, especially when it comes to foods like butter and milk.\n\nChristopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford who was on the expert panel convened in 2024 to advise health authorities on the new dietary guidelines, had said in a previous committee meeting that \"butter is not back\" — at least, not according to any new scientific data.\n\nGardner raised concerns about how butter can raise your LDL cholesterol, in particular, affecting the arteries.\n\nThere is more scientific debate about full-fat cheese and full-fat yogurt, because of the unique ways that calcium and protein are arranged in those foods.\n\nThe new guidelines also highlight the importance of fermented foods, including the dairy item kefir, for promoting a healthy microbiome, which is something nutrition experts and scientists are increasingly emphasizing.\n\nUltra-processed foods are in the crosshairs of the new guidelines. Evidence has been mounting for years that these foods tend to make people eat more calories, and can promote inflammation and, over time, contribute to chronic health issues.\n\n\"If a foreign adversary sought to destroy the health of our children, to cripple our economy, to weaken our national security, there would be no better strategy than to addict us to ultra-processed foods,\" Kennedy said.\n\nNutrition experts say it's generally true that ultra-processed foods are not great, but the composition of those foods still matters. UPFs with more vegetables and whole grains in them are better choices than sugary beverages and sweets. Some studies have suggested that certain ultra-processed items like packaged yogurts with added sugar and industrial whole-grain cereals may not be so detrimental to our health after all.\n\nIn the new pyramid, there is no place for a sugar bowl, because \"added sugars are not part of eating real foods.\"\n\nThe new pyramid recommended avoiding added sugars entirely, while allowing naturally occurring sugar from fruit and dairy.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading sources of added sugar in the American diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks, so though it may be challenging to nix all added sugar in your diet, given the food landscape we live in, cutting back on those items is a simple place to start.",

    "title": "Hegseth's prosecution of Mark Kelly sends a chilling message to US troops and veterans, legal analysts say",
    "description": "Experts said Hegseth's language suggests a predetermined outcome, and that the repercussions could impact troops and retirees.",
    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's extraordinary move to demote a retired military veteran in the Senate comes after weeks of threats for more severe punishment, and experts on military law said it has implications for speech by troops and retired military.\n\nThe highly public decision to censure Democratic Sen. Mark Kelley and to possibly dock his military pension is likely to make military retirees think twice before publicly criticizing the Trump administration, two former military lawyers said. About 2 million people receive military retirement benefits in the US. Some retired military leaders have been strident critics of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe defense secretary announced the decision to review Kelly, a retired Navy captain and astronaut who represents Arizona, for a reduction in his retired grade and pay on Monday, saying the senator's public statements, including a video in which he told US troops not to follow illegal orders, amount to sedition. The two experts on military law said they believe Kelly would have strong grounds to challenge it through the Defense Department's processes or in federal court.\n\nHegseth said the process would be completed within 45 days, and added that he issued a formal censure letter, \"which outlines the totality of Captain (for now) Kelly's reckless misconduct. This Censure is a necessary process step, and will be placed in Captain Kelly's official and permanent military personnel file.\"\n\nDon C. King, a retired Navy judge advocate general who now owns the King Military Law firm, said the fact that the statement was posted by Hegseth on X is \"very unusual\" and ensures the actions against Kelly are well publicized. \"I've never seen that happen before.\"\n\nHegseth's public comments could give Kelly grounds to argue that the grade determination board, made up of military officers, is predisposed to punish the misconduct that the defense secretary alleged and in the way he suggested it.\n\nHegseth's statement \"strongly suggests a predetermined outcome,\" Daniel Maurer, a law professor at Ohio Northern University and a retired Army judge advocate general, said. \"It is the opposite of a measured, unbiased, and due process-focused announcement that protects the integrity of the process and rights of the service member.\"\n\nKelly's actions, Maurer argued, don't meet the definition of sedition under federal law. \"What he said was a restatement of the law and a professional duty,\" he noted; the official manual for courts-martial says service members may disobey a \"patently illegal order.\"\n\nHegseth previously threatened to court-martial Kelly, which likely didn't move forward because of a lack of evidence, experts said. It nonetheless has profound implications for serving officers, whose careers can be marred or effectively ended for having lost their superior's confidence.\n\nHegseth called Kelly's comments seditious in the Monday X post: \"This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay.\"\n\nHegseth cited 10 U.S.C. § 1370(f), a subsection of the Title 10 Armed Forces law, in his decision. Per federal code, military officers are retired in the highest rank \"served satisfactorily,\" and that determines the officer's pension. By law, officer grade determination is based on the officer's conduct while on active duty, not post-retirement.\n\nThe code establishes the reconsideration of an officer's retirement rank as possible under only four reasons. The first is if their rank was procured by fraud. The second is based on whether substantial evidence for revisiting retirement rank comes out afterward, but that's contemplating actions that occurred while the person was on active duty. The third is if a mistake was made in determining the retired grade. None of those applies to Kelly's case.\n\nThe fourth, which experts believe is what Hegseth is referring to, is if the defense secretary determines \"that good cause exists to reopen the determination of retired grade.\"\n\nIt's a fuzzy argument, though. \"I don't see a strong legal case for what Secretary Hegseth is purporting to do,\" King said. \"I don't know that this law supports what he's trying to do.\"\n\nFollowing the review and board recommendation, it's likely that Hegseth's decision could be overturned in court. It would be a \"strong sign\" for the speech rights of service members, Maurer told BI. Kelly may also have additional protections as an elected federal lawmaker under the Constitution's speech and debate clause.\n\nKelly, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made comments in the video released before new allegations emerged in late November about the US military's move to fire a missile at a boat it had already struck. The Pentagon's law of war manual calls an attack on shipwreck survivors illegal.\n\nNow, Kelly has 30 days to submit a response to the proceedings. In a public statement online, the senator said he'd fight back and added: \"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired service member that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way.\"\n\nThat appears to be a consequence of this, Maurer said, which he called \"a chilling effect on retired officers, especially senior-ranking\" ones.\n\nKelly's unusual case comes against the backdrop of a broader crackdown on what military personnel say and post, especially regarding the US' strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, progressive politics, and the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Some troops have sought to self-censor for fear of retaliation.",

    "description": "The Trump administration's new dietary guidelines recommend Americans eat more full-fat dairy. This contradicts established nutrition advice.",
    "fullText": "Dairy started to roar back into fashion in 2025 — and if the Trump administration's new dietary guidelines are anything to go by, it could be about to reach new heights.\n\nThe 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which provide Americans with a framework for what the government considers a healthy diet, advise people to aim for three servings of full-fat dairy per day. The document, released on Wednesday, name-checks butter, whole milk, and \"real\" cheese.\n\nIn the past two years, dairy has had a glow-up as innovative products, blending health and food trends with dairy staples, hit the market. Think indie brands selling cinnamon bun butter and mint chocolate-chip probiotic ice cream, and Fairlife Ultra-filtered milk becoming more popular than ever. Dairy is typically minimally processed, high in protein, and fermented versions are good for gut health.\n\nBut the new guidance contradicts a strong body of evidence linking a diet high in full-fat dairy products and red or processed meat, which are high in saturated fats, to cardiovascular disease.\n\nRecommending full-fat dairy like butter is a big pivot from the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encouraged us to \"move to low-fat or fat-free dairy milk or yogurt or lactose-free dairy or fortified make half soy versions.\"\n\nThis was partly why plant-based diets and alt-milks became hot commodities in the 2010s. Then, some shoppers started to wonder if some of types of products were high enough in protein and more processed than they'd realized.\n\nIn 2024, the organic dairy sector grew by 9.8% up from 5.6% the previous year, according to data shared with Business Insider last year by New Hope Network, an organic-focused consultancy firm. This is far higher than the one or two percent a year increase seen since around 2015.\n\nDuring this time, whole dairy products like raw milk and home-churned butter have become synonymous with the Make America Healthy Again movement helmed by the health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an architect of the new guidelines. It's all part of the conservative vibe shift of the past year.\n\nRFK Jr. said Wednesday these new guidelines are \"how we Make America Healthy Again,\" but public health experts have been quick to point out their contradictions.\n\nNeal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, said that the guidelines recommend limiting cholesterol-raising \"bad\" or saturated fat, while simultaneously promoting red meat and full-fat dairy products.",

    "description": "Taiwan is searching for a missing F-16 fighter jet and pilot after an incident earlier this week.",
    "fullText": "Taiwan's air force has grounded its F-16 fleet and suspended training missions on the jet after one of the planes and the pilot went missing earlier this week.\n\nThe search continues for the pilot and aircraft, which officials believe went down following an in-flight \"anomaly,\" but rough seas off the island have made efforts difficult.\n\nOn Tuesday night local time, an American-made F-16 fighter jet assigned to the Taiwan Air Force's Fifth Tactical Air Wing operating out of Hualien Air Base went missing in the waters off the northeast coast of the island. The Air Force said the fighter was separated from a group during a nighttime training session after the jets entered cloud cover.\n\nThe F-16 suddenly descended quickly. Its altitude was just 1,700 feet when radar contact was lost. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has identified the missing pilot as Capt. Hsin Po-yi. Officials remain unsure whether Hsin successfully ejected from the aircraft, although he had indicated he would eject seconds before the aircraft disappeared. It's unclear if he did.\n\nIn the days since the incident, a search and rescue mission has been ongoing in the waters off Hualien County. Multiple aircraft and vessels have been involved in the mission, but tall waves and strong winds have been complicating the search for the jet and Hsin.\n\nAir Force officials told reporters during a press conference on Wednesday that there appeared to be a malfunction of the F-16's main onboard computer in which the aircraft's flight path was no longer displayed.\n\nNow, Taiwanese air force officials have grounded all of Taiwan's F-16 fleet for inspections, and training missions have been temporarily suspended. Taiwan currently has about 140 F-16s, the older A/B models, that it has upgraded in recent years. It is expected to receive a batch of the newer F-16V or Viper jets in the coming years to add to its fleet.\n\nThe F-16 is made by American defense giant Lockheed Martin. Though it's been flying for over 50 years, it still represents a highly capable fourth-generation jet. The newest operator of the aircraft is Ukraine, which received a limited number from NATO partner nations.\n\nThis crash involving the Taiwanese military follows a similar incident that occurred in January 2022, when a Taiwanese F-16 went down off the island's west coast while taking part in training exercises. At the time, the F-16 went missing after taking off from Chiayi Air Base in southern Taiwan. In response, Taiwan suspended its combat training for the fleet.\n\nIt's not uncommon to see fleets grounded after accidents, especially if the cause is unclear. The US military has done this regularly.\n\nTaiwan's Air Force has been strained in recent years by constant scrambling to track Chinese military aircraft, which regularly fly into the country's air defense identification zone. Taipei's smaller air force has experienced higher operational tempos that have exhausted pilots, aircraft, and resources and stressed maintainers. Most recently, Taiwan held rapid response drills in reaction to China's massive exercises nearby.",

    "description": "The new MDs hail from groups including investment banking and investing, as the bank rides renewed dealmaking momentum heading into the new year.",
    "fullText": "New Year's Eve is behind us, but if you hear the sound of bottles popping — it might be coming from the halls of Morgan Stanley's headquarters.\n\nThe Wall Street bank on Wednesday announced the appointment of 184 new managing directors — a roughly 6% increase from last year's class of 173 MDs.\n\nAt Morgan Stanley, managing director is the firm's highest designation. The announcement comes amid the annual promotion season on Wall Street and follows Goldman Sachs' November elevation of more than 600 managing directors, part of a biennial process at the rival firm.\n\nThe size of each of Morgan Stanley's annual MD classes has fluctuated. In 2024, the bank named 155 managing directors. In 2023, it also appointed 184; and in 2022, it elevated 199.\n\nSeventy percent of the newly appointed execs work in a revenue-generating capacity, interacting with clients and making the bank money, while 30% work in middle- and back-office or corporate functions.\n\nThe promotions come after a strong year for the firm's dealmaking business. Morgan Stanley finished third on the worldwide M&A financial advisory league tables, according to LSEG, trailing only Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.\n\nIt ended the year advising on more than $1 trillion in deal value across more than 400 transactions, LSEG's December data show. That marked a significant jump from the prior year, when the bank advised on roughly $707 billion in deals across 368 mergers or acquisitions.\n\nAcross Wall Street, headhunters and investment bankers have told Business Insider in recent weeks that they expect 2026 to generate robust activity in mergers and the capital markets. That backdrop may help explain why 48% of Morgan Stanley's new managing directors came from its Institutional Securities Group, which advises corporate clients on IPOs, buyouts, and sales.\n\nThe bank informed the newly elevated executives on Wednesday and is expected to release the full list of names publicly in the coming days. The firm has also communicated bonuses to its employees, one of the first on Wall Street to inform workers how their contributions from last year resulted in their incentive compensation.\n\nBelow is a look at the statistics Morgan Stanley shared about the composition of its 2026 managing director class.\n\n70% in Revenue, 30% in Infrastructure, the firm's middle- and back-office or corporate functions.\n\nRegionally, Americas 67%, EMEA 18%, Asia 14%\n\nOf US-based MD promotes, 31% of the class are ethnically diverse and 69% are White.",

    "title": "Avelo said it will stop deportation flights for ICE",
    "description": "Avelo Airlines began operating deportation flights in May and has seen protests and calls for boycotts in response.",
    "fullText": "It turns out that deporting people for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency isn't the profit booster Avelo Airlines had hoped.\n\nThe budget airline announced a new network strategy on Tuesday designed to strengthen its balance sheet after years of inconsistent earnings, including the closure of several bases and the removal of six aircraft from its fleet.\n\nAmong the closures is Mesa, Arizona — the core of Avelo's chartered aircraft support for the federal government's highly controversial mass deportations. A company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that this also means the end of its ICE contract.\n\n\"Avelo will close the base at [Mesa] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,\" they said. \"The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.\"\n\nThe airline began operating these deportation flights in May but received significant backlash from travelers and faced protests at airports like Albany, Burbank, and New Haven, Connecticut. Avelo has not disclosed the amount it has received from the government.\n\nIt has also downplayed the political optics.\n\nAvelo's CEO, Andrew Levy, previously framed the decision to fly migrants out of the US as financially driven, acknowledging that it is a \"sensitive and complicated topic,\" but said the ICE charters would provide the company with stability and keep its crew members employed.\n\nA spokesperson in April said that Avelo had also operated deportation flights under the Biden Administration.\n\n\"Regardless of the administration or party affiliation, as a US flag carrier, when our country calls and requests assistance, our practice is to say 'yes,'\" they said. \"We follow all protocols from DHS and FAA, honoring our core value of safety always.\"\n\nCharter airlines Miami-based Global Crossing Airlines and Kansas City-based Eastern Air Express have long carried out deportations on behalf of ICE. GlobalX, for example, said its five-year contract awarded in 2024 is expected to generate roughly $65 million in annual revenue.\n\nBut activists said Avelo's involvement reflects a broader shift in the deportation system, as it's unusual for scheduled commercial airlines like Avelo to dedicate aircraft and crews to ICE flights.\n\nThis focal point of criticism coincides with the broader expansion of deportation activity under the Trump Administration that prompted ICE's need to enlist additional operators.\n\nThere were nearly 12,000 deportation, domestic shuttle, and other removal-related flights across operators between President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20 and November 30, 2025, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Human Rights First.\n\nThe Avelo flights are also reportedly not meeting the expected safety standards. Avelo's flight attendant union said in a September memo to Avelo management that the cabin crew \"were discouraged or prohibited from performing safety checks and cabin walk-throughs required by the FAA.\"\n\nIt added that there weren't any aircraft modifications that would allow restrained passengers to evacuate during an emergency.\n\nThe cabin crew working these ICE flights were specifically hired for this role, as were pilots and mechanics. According to the April cabin crew listing, pay started at $28 per hour.\n\nAvelo's operation once stretched coast-to-coast as the airline expanded aggressively into new markets in search of demand.\n\nBut competition intensified, and Avelo struggled to achieve consistent profitability as rivals like Breeze Airways — along with legacy carriers offering low-cost basic economy fares — lured away price-sensitive customers.\n\nThe airline has been reshaping its network and fleet in response to those pressures for years.\n\nAs part of that retrenchment — and beyond the now-deemed money-losing ICE flights — Avelo announced an order for Embraer E195-E2 aircraft, a smaller regional jet that marks a shift away from its traditionally all-Boeing fleet.\n\nAvelo also closed its entire West Coast operation in October due to low demand and pivoted its focus to the East Coast. The carrier also plans to exit its base at Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, in January, axing routes to Montego Bay and Cancún. The airline cited revenue underperformance.\n\nFurther, Avelo is closing bases in Raleigh and Wilmington, North Carolina. It will instead focus its operations out of four core airports: New Haven, Connecticut; Wilmington, Delaware; Charlotte, North Carolina — operating out of the city's smaller Concord-Padgett Regional Airport — and Lakeland, Florida.\n\nAvelo said it plans to open a base in McKinney, Texas, near Dallas, in late 2026.\n\nThis pivot reinforces the airline's strategy of connecting secondary airports to larger cities while still accessible to major metropolitan areas — for example, its Delaware base serves the Philadelphia region, and Lakeland sits between Orlando and Tampa.\n\n\"These changes enable Avelo to focus on sustainably scaling five core bases in 2026 and to prepare the company for growth in the coming years, facilitated by the company's recent order for up to 100 Embraer 195-E2 aircraft,\" the company said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump took executive action aimed at defense contractors after a series of Truth Social posts.\n\nThe president signed an executive order on Wednesday that would ban defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\n\"Every firm across our economy has a right to profit from prudent investment and hard work, but the American defense industrial base also has the responsibility to ensure that America's warfighters have the best possible equipment and weapons,\" the order said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump said he would \"not permit\" stock buybacks or dividends from US defense companies in a post on Truth Social.\n\nIn his post, the president blasted defense contractors for issuing \"massive\" dividends and buying back their stock. He said he wouldn't permit such practices until defense firms sped up production.\n\n\"Therefore, I will not permit Dividends or Stock Buybacks for Defense Companies until such time as these problems are rectified,\" he wrote. \"MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH!\"\n\nTrump also took issue with what he called \"exorbitant and unjustifiable\" compensation packages for industry executives. Until companies build \"NEW and MODERN\" production plants, defense execs should be making no more than $5 million, he said, without providing details on how those guidelines would be implemented.\n\nHe later singled out Raytheon in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nDefense stocks fell after Trump's Truth Social post on Wednesday. Notable movers include:\n\nThe defense sector has been a big focus for Trump dating back to his first term as president. In the past year, he's floated projects like creating a Golden Dome missile defense system and signed off on increasing defense spending to a record $901 billion.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's leveraged buyout bid again, citing financial and litigation risk",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board raised its hackles on Wednesday while rejecting Paramount Skydance's bid for the eighth time in favor of Netflix's offer.\n\nWBD used pointed language, calling Paramount's bid the \"largest leveraged buyout in history by a wide margin\" and tying its potential failure to previous big LBOs that didn't close on the initially agreed-upon terms.\n\nIn its new filing, WBD also described Paramount's financial condition as \"not strong,\" noting that its credit was already rated \"junk\" by S&P before the \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" required by the deal. Paramount, for its part, has emphasized that $40.4 billion in equity of its new bid is fully backstopped by Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nWBD's strong language suggests that the board and leadership \"just want to move on,\" and the \"largest LBO\" angle is a new and compelling one, Wharton M&A professor Paul Nary said on X.\n\nDavid Zaslav-led WBD also ramped up its accusations that Paramount has acted litigiously and leaked to the press.\n\nIn the filing, WBD cited new press reports in the New York Post indicating Paramount was considering abandoning its offer and might pursue \"DefCon 1\" litigation against WBD's board. WBD said that Paramount didn't deny the reports, suggesting that the company was leaking to the press. WBD had previously complained that there had been \"extensive media leaks and rumors\" about Paramount's proposals.\n\nM&A experts said the stepped-up language was likely drafted in anticipation of a lawsuit against WBD, either by Paramount or WBD shareholders.\n\nNow that Paramount has lost to Netflix, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit,\" said Raul Gastesi, a partner at Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella.\n\nCorey Martin, managing partner of Granderson Des Rochers, a law firm focused on entertainment and media, said the new filing felt calibrated to deter WBD shareholders from backing Paramount's hostile bid.\n\n\"The audience is really the shareholders, because there's always the risk of shareholder lawsuits,\" Martin said. \"It is colorful stuff, but Paramount's is a hostile bid.\"\n\nMartin also saw the emphasis on legal and press tactics as part of a PR strategy to portray Paramount as a bad actor, as well as a pre-litigation tactic.\n\nLightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a note on Wednesday that Paramount could still outbid Netflix, but it would \"require an overhaul of their current bid, and a dramatic increase in the cash invested from the Ellison family and/or their friends and financing partners.\"",

    "fullText": "It looks like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are headed for a courtroom showdown.\n\nDuring a hearing on Wednesday, a California judge said she plans to reject Altman's lawyers' last-ditch efforts to end Musk's case against OpenAI and its CEO.\n\n\"This case is going to trial,\" US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said at a hearing to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" she said, referring to Musk's case. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nIn his lawsuit filed in 2024, Musk accused OpenAI of misleading him in its decision to abandon its original nonprofit mission and structure in favor of a profit-oriented model, including through its partnership with Microsoft.\n\nMusk says he donated $38 million to the maker of ChatGPT over the years to support its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humankind. The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure. Musk later went on to launch his own AI company, xAI, in 2023.",

    "title": "The US government says you should be proteinmaxxing. Experts say that can backfire — here's why.",
    "description": "The U.S. government is proteinmaxxing with new dietary guidelines recommending more meat and fewer whole grains. Dietitians and doctors disagree.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. government today announced that it's ending the \"war on protein.\"\n\nIf there's a war on, protein seems to already be winning it. The nutrient has dominated grocery lists, store aisles, and social media feeds for the past year.\n\nThe protein obsession is big business, driving products like protein pancakes, protein popcorn, protein lattes, and more. Last fall, Starbucks debuted a $2 \"protein foam\" that you can add to any cold drink.\n\nNow it's the first word in the new dietary guidelines, straight from Robert F. Kennedy Jr's \"Make America Healthy Again\" playbook, with an emphasis on meaty meals like steak and chicken.\n\nBut doctors and dietitians have been warning that protein is beginning to eclipse other crucial nutrients on Americans' plates. And, far from helping us cut back on ultra-processed foods, the protein craze has been a boon for food manufacturing, as protein has been added to health-ify chips, candy, pastries, and cereal.\n\nHere's what to know about the latest recommendations, how to figure out the right amount of protein for you, and the best ways to get it.\n\nThere's no question that protein is an essential nutrient, helping to support healthy muscles and bones, regulate metabolism, and manage appetite.\n\nIt's also true that it can be challenging for some people to get enough protein.\n\nFor decades, women were urged to diet on protein-poor fad foods like cabbage soup and plain grapefruits, mistakenly thinking a hearty meal or heavy weight would make us bulky. Now, in part thanks to the rise of strength training, our appetites have come back with a vengeance, and protein is a major part of the menu.\n\nThe recent boom of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss has also brought protein to the forefront, as Americans have pushed to hold on to muscle mass while losing fat.\n\nProtein is also a crucial nutrient for longevity. As we get older, our muscle mass tends to naturally decline, which, if we're not careful, can lead to frailty and an increased risk of injury and illness. Eating enough protein as we age helps maintain muscle for more resilience and strength at age 60 and beyond.\n\nPrevious dietary guidelines focused on the bare minimum of protein you'd need to avoid malnutrition, which is around 0.36 grams per pound of body weight (about 54 grams per day for a 150-pound person).\n\nHowever, avoiding starvation is rarely the only goal of eating. Nutrition and exercise science suggest the optimal amount of protein for building muscle is about twice that amount, about 0.7 grams per pound daily (105 grams for a 150-pound person). In a day, that translates to about 30 to 35 grams per meal.\n\nToday, some top TikTokers log themselves eating more than 100 grams of protein at a single meal, and 300 or more grams in a day. Great, if you're the Rock.\n\nFor the rest of us, there's no reason to spend that extra time, money, and energy on all that protein, said Dr. Federica Amati, medical scientist and head nutritionist at the nutrition app ZOE.\n\n\"Definitely, I think it's overrated,\" she previously told Business Insider. \"The interest in protein isn't going anywhere because it's been ingrained, especially in the US culture.\"\n\nProtein has been a mainstay of American nutrition for well over four decades: from the Atkins era in the 70s, peaking in the early aughts, to current keto, low-carb, and carnivore diets. Along the way, food fads alternatively demonized dietary fats and carbs. For any health-conscious person, what else was left to eat but more and more protein?\n\nThe problem, according to Amati and others, is that protein is hogging the spotlight from other key nutrients that play a major role in our health.\n\n\"If you just focus on telling people you need to eat one gram of protein for a kilogram of body weight, then you don't know what else is going on the plate,\" Amati said.\n\nFiber, for instance, plays a crucial role in gut health, metabolism, and longevity. And you're far more likely to be missing out on fiber than protein, Amati said. Incidentally, the latest dietary guidelines put key sources of fiber, like beans and whole grains, near the bottom of the pyramid.\n\nEven for athletes, who need extra protein to recover from the strain of exercise, can get too much protein, cardiologist Dr. Dmitry Yaranov previously told Business Insider. Bodybuilders, for instance, look like the pinnacle of health, but \"end up with weak hearts and blocked arteries,\" he said.\n\nThe latest dietary guidelines recommend between 0.6 and 0.9 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily, between 90 and 135 grams for a 150-pound person.\n\nHowever, Amati said you don't need to track your grams of protein at all. If you simply must count your protein on a daily basis, she recommends calculating a percentage instead of the number of grams.\n\nIf you're eating around 2000 calories a day, 100 grams of protein would translate to about 20% of your diet, leaving the other 80% of your diet for more crucial nutrients.\n\n\"What the percentage helps us do is focus on the importance of a varied diet,\" she said.\n\nMeat makes up a large part of Kennedy's new vision of healthy eating in America (including our right to fries soaked in cattle fat), part of the comeback movement for dairy, butter, and other animal-based foods.\n\nBut red and processed meats (including trendy jerky snacks and deli meats) have consistently been linked to a higher risk of heart disease and some cancers.\n\nAmati said your best bet is focusing on variety in your diet. If you're eating a range of foods — including plant-based protein sources like beans, nuts, and seeds — you'll get all the essential amino acids you need, along with plenty of fiber, vitamins, and minerals.",

    "fullText": "Reid Hoffman isn't a fan of California's proposed wealth tax, and he said he let Rep. Mo Khanna know about it during a recent conversation.\n\nIn a post on X, the LinkedIn cofounder — and prominent Democratic donor — said Rep. Mo Khanna had reached out to discuss the proposed tax, which would impose a 5% tax on billionaires in the state of California. Hoffman called the proposal \"badly designed\" with \"massive flaws\" that would be \"horrendous\" for innovation.\n\n\"The proposed CA wealth tax is badly designed in so many ways that a simple social post cannot cover all of the massive flaws,\" Hoffman wrote. \"One well-documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal. Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.\"\n\nHe said that, after the conversation, he believes Khanna sees Silicon Valley as \"a massively important creation of the future,\" adding that the congressman wants to \"preserve and evolve capitalism\" through the proposed tax.\n\n\"It is true that we need to preserve and grow the incredible creation and generativity of Silicon Valley,\" Hoffman wrote. \"It is also true that we must figure out how to help people who have not benefited from the wealth, jobs, and company creation engine of Silicon Valley thus far.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Khanna wrote that he appreciated \"the excellent dialogue\" with Hoffman.\n\n\"You summarized my goal and aspiration correctly!\" Khanna said.\n\nSilicon Valley superstars have been split on the proposed wealth tax. Some prominent figures in tech, like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, have come out in support of the proposal, while others have sharply criticized it.\n\nGoogle's Larry Page moved several of his assets and his businesses out of the state ahead of an end-of-2025 deadline that would have risked exposing him to the proposed tax, Business Insider exclusively reported on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump singled out Raytheon on Wednesday in his sweeping criticism of the defense industry, threatening to cut the company's government contracts if it didn't invest \n\nTrump called out Raytheon by name after earlier saying he wouldn't allow defense firms to do buybacks or pay dividends until they speed up production. The president said Raytheon has been \"the least responsive\" to the government's needs, slow in increasing volume, and has prioritized returning capital to shareholders over the military's priorities.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government, Trump said in a Truth Social post.\n\nA spokesperson for RTX Corporation, formerly known as Raytheon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The company rebranded as RTX in 2023 following a merger with United Technologies Corporation.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump fired a broadside at the entire defense industry, posting on Truth Social that he would \"not permit\" further stock buybacks or dividends to be issued to shareholders. Trump also said that until defense companies build \"NEW and MODERN Production Plants\" their executives' pay should be capped at $5 million.\n\nLike its competitors, shares of RTX dropped after Trump's initial post about the industry. RTX rebounded in early after-hours trading, trending up more than 3% as of 6 p.m. ET.\n\nIt's unclear why Trump singled out Raytheon in particular. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders. Raytheon announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023 and says it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.\n\nLast year, the company paid out a dividend in March. It's unclear if Trump's statement will affect those plans or even the extent to which a president could prohibit a publicly traded company from fulfilling its previously declared financial obligations.\n\nTrump has frequently used the presidential bully pulpit to criticize companies and their CEOs. In August 2025, Trump called for Intel to fire its CEO Lip-Bu Tan, only to later change his stance after the US government acquired a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker.\n\nIt is less common for Trump to directly threaten a company's government contracts, although he has done so as well.\n\nIn July 2025, Trump threatened to cut off Elon Musk's companies from government contracts during a heated back-and-forth with the world's richest person. Since then, Trump has reconciled with the billionaire.",

    "title": "This Radar-Equipped Stove Shutoff Is One of the Most Practical Things I Saw at CES",
    "description": "The iGuard keeps seniors safe in the kitchen by reducing the chance of cooking fires.",
    "fullText": "Radar-based sensors seem to be having a moment at CES, especially in tech meant for people to keep tabs on their aging family members. One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove.\n\niGuard is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.\n\nA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on.\n\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.\n\nThe device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.\n\nA previous version, called the iGuardStove, used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.\n\nI’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuard has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended.\n\nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuard can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuard has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running.\n\nThe device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.\n\nWhile a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuard seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.\n\nUpdate 1/7/2025 at 7:48 a.m. PST: Corrected to note that the new product is named iGuard, and the previous version with motion sensors was iGuardStove.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

Given the pace of life these days, the end of the Obama administration feels, somehow, as distant as the series' nostalgic 1980s setting. The show solidified Netflix as the streamer to beat in terms of original programming, and introduced a new generation of child stars who are all now firmly adults. The show's blend of nostalgia, horror, and small-town weirdness has been wildly influential (and endlessly copied), but its success is based, also, on its synthesis and deft reworking of deeply familiar elements. In that spirit, here are a few shows of the past and present that, in various ways, carry some of those Stranger vibes.\n\nTravel to The Town (we never get a name for it), a palce from which no one can ever leave. The residents and visitors aren't metaphorically trapped, but literally so, as in the later seasons of Stranger Things, as they are beset by creatures come from the woods that kill anyone found outside after dark. The Matthews family learn all about this firsthand when they roll into the place in their RV and soon find themselves trapped alongside the local sheriff (Harold Perrineau) just as it's getting dark. The monsters here aren't just mindlessly hungry, they're cunning and sadistic, and more than capable of killing residents in gory ways. It's a supernatural spin on the \"small towns ain't what they seem\" vibe. Stream From on MGM+.\n\nSophia Lillis, straight from playing Beverly Marsh in the It movies, stars as Sydney Novak, a 17-year-old living in a small town with her mother and sister. Her father recently died by suicide; she has a crush on her best friend; and all she and her mother do is argue. In the middle of all of that, she discovers that she had powers triggered by her emotions, both of which she'll need to learn to control if she wants to get her life in order. As the lead, Lillis sells the hell out of this offbeat coming-of-age story which was canceled after one season. Because of course it was. Stream I Am Not Okay With This on Netflix.\n\nComplete tonal mismatch here aside, there are few stranger shows streaming right now than this weird sci-fi apocalypse from Breaking Bad's Vince Gilligan. Rhea Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, a fantasy romance author and general grouch who becomes one of only 13 people on the planet immune to the \"Joining\"—the result of an alien virus that transforms the rest of humanity into a peaceful, perky, and perpetually content hive mind. Carol refuses to surrender her miserableness in the face of a loss of identity, fighting instead to restore humanity to its admittedly cruddy ways. Thrilling, heartbreaking, and oddly funny, the show manages to address some big questions about what it means to be human, and what we'd be willing to give up to change. Stream Pluribus on Apple TV+.\n\nThere are few (if any) teens here, but Haven (based on the Stephen King short story \"The Colorado Kid\") has got the \"weird stuff goes down in a small town\" vibe down pat. Emily Rose stars as Audrey Parker, an FBI Special Agent sent to the title town of Haven, Maine on a routine case. Soon, she gets drawn into “the Troubles,\" a series of harmful supernatural events that have recurred throughout the town’s history—and, by no coincidence, are happening again. A supernatural-case-of-the-week format gives way to a bigger mystery when Audrey comes to learn that this isn’t her first time in Haven, nor the first time she’s encountered the Troubles. Lucas Bryant and Eric Balfour co-star. Stream Haven on Peacock and Prime Video.\n\nDark began as a mystery involving a missing child and evolved, over its three seasons, into a wildly complex narrative: a time travel-driven story that explores dark family secrets over the course of several generations. The German import has a striking look and incredibly atmospheric feel, with an ensemble cast of teens and adults whose narratives are deftly intertwined. Especially given the title, you'd be absolutely right to assume that the tone here is quite a bit more dark than that of Stranger Things, but the shows have plenty in common, including an interest in the '80s. Stream Dark on Netflix.\n\nNot a series, precisely, but a series of movies that play out like a miniseries (at least initially), and that play in the retro-nostalgia horror-vibe that Stranger Things does so well. Adapted from the R. L. Stine books, Fear Street Part One: 1994 kicks off the series by introducing the town of Shadyside, which the local kids call “Shittyside,” and has a dark history of multiple murders, most of them covered up. A group of teens upsets the grave of a witch, kicking off the revival of a murderous cult. There are some legit gore and scares (it’s YA, more or less, but definitely not kids’ stuff) as Janiak pays homage to a wide range of horror movies past. The series continues with an impeccable camp slasher homage in Fear Street Part Two: 1978, and then an origin tale that brings the initial trilogy to a conclusion in Fear Street Part Three: 1666. There's a standalone fourth film, as well, and more on the way, but you're fine sticking with the initial trilogy. Stream Fear Street Part One: 1994 on Netflix.\n\nThis would be the easiest possible recommendation for Stranger Things fans, were it not for the fact that the well-reviewed show was cancelled after one season (though it still ends with a fairly satisfying wrap up). Based on the pretty great comic book series from Brian K. Vaughan and Cliff Chiang, the show follows four young friends—Erin, Tiff, Mac, and KJ—on their paper route the morning after Halloween in 1988. After the skies turn pink and they're accosted by competing groups of weirdos, they head for the safety of Erin's house, only to discover they're suddenly in 2019. Made into targets by their inadvertent time travel, the girls have to stay alive while also deciding whether they want to take the chance to change their own timelines. Stream Paper Girls on Prime Video.\n\nA gorgeous-looking anthology (sort of), Tales From the Loop takes place in the small town of Mercer, Ohio—a town that happens to sit upon the titular Loop, a physics lab exploring mysteries for which science has no answers. Each episode offers the story of a person or family in the town impacted by the work of the Loop, in slow-burning stories about the intersection of technology and human existence. It’s based on a conceptual art book by artist Simon Stålenhag, and successfully ports over that book’s striking look and feel. It's far quieter and more meditative than something like Stranger Things, but worth your time if that's your mood. Stream Tales from the Loop on Prime Video.\n\nThe least buzzy of Mike Flanagan's Netflix offerings is every bit as good as Midnight Mass, The Fall of the House of Usher, et al. Based on the YA novel by Christopher Pike, it follows a group of eight terminally ill young patients at a bucolic hospice home run by a secretive and mysterious doctor (A Nightmare on Elm Street's Heather Langenkamp). Each night the kids meet secretly to share scary stories, with each also promising to return from beyond the grave when the time comes. Spooky and surprisingly moving, the show was planned as more than a miniseries, and the cancellation left some questions unanswered, but the ending is still pretty satisfying. Stream The Midnight Club on Netflix.\n\nTeens and adults in a deceptively quiet small town (in the '80s, no less) face tragedy accompanied by supernatural threats from outside of our normal space and time. That's a reasonably fair synopsis of both Stranger Things and Twin Peaks, but it also serves to obscure the massive tonal differences between the two shows. Kyle MacLachlan plays FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, who arrives in the title town to investigate the murder of teenager homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). His arrival in town precipitates a (very) long night of the soul as Cooper uncovers secrets and mysteries among the town's delightfully, and often disturbingly, weird residents. Stream Twin Peaks on Paramount+ or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThe Upside Down of Stranger Things is a dark, challenging, chaotic mirror to our own reality—so imagine a similarly sinister parallel space, now with a bit more obvious structure. Video-game obsessed Arisu gets his wish, after a fashion, when he finds himself, along with a couple of friends, transported to an alternate, eerily abandoned version of Tokyo—the title’s Borderland—vividly brought to life via some clever green screen work. The three are directed to an arena and given the instructions for the game, which they’ll be playing whether they want to or not. The first competition involves a locked-room-style puzzle; if they fail, the room goes up in flames with them in it—think Ready Player One, with deadlier stakes. There are games each night, though the rules allow for winners to get time off. There are a lot of rules, actually, but the games are cleverly and sadistically constructed. Stream Alice in Borderland on Netflix.\n\nPeyton List stars as Maddie, a teenager in small-town Wisconsin for whom her death is very much just the beginning. Stuck in a high school in the afterlife (because hell is definitely for children), she goes on a journey to solve her own murder while uncovering secrets and lies in both worlds. It all sounds a bit grim, but the show has a sense of fun about it: While Maddie does develop the ability to communicate with the living, her world is populated by ghost teens from various eras and generations, with customs, mores, and cliques having developed in ghost high school just as in our world. Stream School Spirits on Paramount+ or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nTaking a turn off of Fear Street, we return to R.L. Stine—who is, after all, our reigning master of YA horror (his name appearing on well over 300 books). In contrast with earlier adaptations, this series ditches the episodic anthology format of the 1990s series in favor of a more anthologized teen drama, probably in direct response to the popularity of Stranger Things. The first season is set in the present (while involving a mystery from the past), so skips the nostalgic charms (and traps) of the Netflix series, finding a modern group of teens in a weird town encountering the various monsters and scares (many of them legitimately freaky). Each season shifts the focus to a new story, with a new cast of actors in their mid-20s playing teens. Stream Goosebumps on Disney+.\n\nThis time-jumping survival drama is about a group of teenage girls becoming stranded in the wilderness in 1996 and doing terrible things to survive—the extent of which we only learn about via flashbacks from the present, where the events of those 19 months continue to have an impact. There are teases of the supernatural here, much of it ambiguous, but there's plenty of horror in a past that we're still seeing fleshed (ahem) out. Where Stranger Things revels in its '80s setting, Yellowjackets more cynically posits that there's a huge difference between the version of the past we talk about and the one that really happened. Stream Yellowjackets on Paramount+ (the first two seasons are also on Netflix) or you can buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThe much-loved, if relatively short-lived, animated series follows twin siblings Mabel and Dipper Pines (Kristen Schaal and Jason Ritter) sent to spend the summer with their great-uncle (aka \"Grunkle\") Stan (voiced by show creator Alex Hirsch). While helping Stan run his mystery-themed tourist shack, the kids run into a series of supernatural mysteries, many related to the show's ultimate antagonist, dream demon Bill Cipher. Like Stranger Things, the series came to a planned conclusion (albeit after four years rather than ten), and it's finale was similarly a ratings blockbuster—the highest rated telecast in the history of Disney XD, as a matter of fact.

    "title": "Four Ways to Keep Your House Warm When the Heat Goes Out",
    "description": "It’s freezing outside and your power just went out—along with your furnace or boiler.",
    "fullText": "Living in a comfortable, heated house is something a lot of us take for granted. When the cold weather hits, we just put on thick socks, turn up the thermostat (or take other steps), and go about our business. But most modern homes rely on the electrical grid to keep that heat flowing. Even if your home is heated by natural gas or heating oil, there’s most likely an electric component to your heating system.\n\nThat means that when the power goes out—say, in the middle of a fierce blizzard—so does your heat. Even recently built homes can lose interior heat pretty quickly, dropping to uncomfortable (and even unsafe) temperatures within a day at most. If you’re not sure when power will be restored, you’ll need to find a way to keep the place as warm as possible if you and your property are going to come out of the experience unscathed. Here are are four ways to keep your house warm if your heat goes out.\n\nIf you have some warning that a power loss is possible during the cold months—a winter storm warning, for example—it’s a good idea to “pre-heat” your home. The warmer your house is when the power goes out, the longer it will remain at a safe and/or comfortable temperature. You don’t necessarily want to make it tropical, but a few degrees higher than usual will buy you some time if the power goes out. Combined with sealing the house as tightly as possible—by hanging thermal curtains or blankets over windows, applying plastic insulation kits to windows, and deploying draft stoppers under doorways and anywhere else cold air is getting in—this strategy can be very effective.\n\nTrying to keep a large house warm without an active heating system is a fool’s errand. Instead, focus on a single room where everyone in the house can gather, because a small room is a lot easier to warm up. A few considerations about which room to choose:\n\nSince heat rises, rooms on upper floors will be warmer than rooms on the main floor.\n\nA room that gets a lot of sunlight can be warmed during the day by opening up the curtains and letting that solar energy do its thing.\n\nSmaller rooms will be easier to heat up, but consider how many people will need to live and sleep in there.\n\nRooms near bathrooms (or with en-suite baths) offer a bit more convenience, especially if you’re going to be hunkering down for a while.\n\nOnce you’ve selected the room you’ll be using, try to keep it closed up as much as possible (covering windows, stopping up drafts, keeping the door closed). Introducing an indoor-safe heater is a good idea if you have one (or you can make one; see below).\n\nIf none of the rooms in your house are ideal, you could also consider setting up a tent indoors. Tents are designed to hold in heat, and can create a small, controllable environment that will be easier to keep warm in a pinch.\n\nIf you’ve planned ahead and have an indoor-safe propane or kerosene heater (or even a solar-powered portable heater), that will obviously help to keep your home warm (just be certain to follow all the instructions for ventilating whatever space you’re heating up). If you haven’t, or you discover that your propane tanks have leaked and you have no fuel, don’t despair. You can still generate heat by building a candle-pot heater, which is an old-school way of generating some quick heat.\n\nA candle-pot heater is pretty easy to set up: You’ll need 1-3 clay flower pots (or similar ceramic containers) in different sizes, some non-flammable materials to set up on (bricks or stone tiles will work), and some candles. Then arrange everything:\n\nSet up your bricks or other materials to create a raised platform, with plenty of airflow.\n\nPlace your smallest pot upside down on the bricks and cover the hole in the bottom (if it’s a flowerpot).\n\nPlace the larger pot on top, and then the largest on top of that if you have three pots.\n\nPlace your candles underneath and light them.\n\nThe candles don’t produce much heat, but the clay pots will absorb that heat and slowly start to radiate out. Instead of the candles’ heat just rising up to your ceiling and being cooled by the frigid air already in the room, the pots capture it and intensify it.\n\nWill this replace your home’s heating system, or even a portable propane heater? Not by a mile. But it will make a difference, especially in a small space.\n\nA few things to keep in mind here:\n\nCandles are open flames, so never leave your heater unattended, and always be conscious of fire hazards.\n\nYou can place a foil-covered panel behind the heater to help reflect the heat in a specific direction (say, toward the chair you’re sitting in).\n\nIf you have a gas furnace, it’s not that hard to keep it running even during a blackout if you have an alternative power source like a generator or even a power bank. The furnace needs electricity to run the ignition, the blower, and communication between the thermostat and the furnace or boiler. A decent generator or robust battery can definitely keep your furnace running for a while—and those extra hours or days could be crucial in an extended cold-weather blackout.\n\nIf you can see an obvious on/off switch on your furnace, you can pretty easily install a transfer switch like this one (here’s a video demonstrating how it’s done). This allows you to plug in a generator or power bank and keep your furnace running even when the power’s out—all you have to do is plug it in and flip the switch. If you’re not entirely comfortable with electrical wiring, you can hire a licensed electrician to install it as well, of course. Once it’s done, you’ll never have to worry about a cold house again—as long as you pair the switch with a generator or battery solution of sufficient power to keep things running.",

    "description": "Standard wheelchairs are less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that.",
    "fullText": "Wheelchairs are available at airports, hotels, resorts, theme parks, and on cruises, but standard wheelchairs require ongoing effort and can struggle through difficult terrain. Standard wheelchairs are simply less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that.\n\nWheelMove is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are. It debuted at CES 2026, marking a significant leap in accessibility for wheelchair users who travel.\n\nWhen I found WheelMove at CES \"Unveiled,\" I thought back to a recent family trip just two weeks ago, where two of my older family members often rented wheelchairs. They don't use wheelchairs in their day-to-day lives, but walking through a theme park all day wasn't possible. They needed support navigating the park, and the rest of us gladly took shifts pushing their wheelchairs. With a portable attachment like WheelMove, though, wheelchair users can use less effort and enjoy more independence through the battery-powered, remote-controlled attachment.\n\nRiders simply attach WheelMove to the front of any standard wheelchair, and the device lifts the wheelchair's smaller front wheels off the ground. Once attached, the rider controls the WheelMove through a basic remote control on their armrest, thigh, or wherever is most comfortable. The attachment weighs under 20 pounds, including its 10-inch wheel, 250W motor, and a battery that goes about 15 miles on a charge. Carrying an additional battery can double its range before needing to recharge, and it can navigate terrains including gravel, grass, and uneven surfaces like cobblestone.\n\nWheelMove is an incredibly innovative assistive technology poised to broaden personal mobility for those who need it, and it's also one of the finalists for the official Best of CES 2026 awards for the travel category. Pre-orders are available in France where the start-up is based, but the founders plan to expand internationally later this year. It costs about €5,000 or $6,000.",

    "description": "Tired of all the Microsoft AI slop? You can remove it entirely.",
    "fullText": "Some people love AI. If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.\n\nIf you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out \nRemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).\n\nTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\n\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n\nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.",

    "fullText": "There are likely occasions in your day-to-day life in which you allow someone else to use your phone, whether it's letting your kid play a game or sharing content with a friend.

    "title": "How 'Cognitive Overload' Might Be Hampering Your Productivity",
    "description": "Our brains simply aren't built to handle this much stimulation.",
    "fullText": "I write a lot about productivity, which means I also read a lot about it. Over the last few months, I've noticed an uptick in people discussing something called \"cognitive overload,\" citing it as a potential reason for a decline in output. The phrase stuck out to me as one of those buzzy terms that has the potential to be overused until it's meaningless—but at its core, it certainly has a real, clear definition that can be helpful tool in maximizing productivity.\n\nBasically, cognitive overload is what happens when you're inundated with more information than your brain can process, so your brain just gives up altogether, making hard to focus on anything at all. Here's what to know about it and what to do once you identify it.\n\nYou know all those jokes on social media about how a single news item or food product from modern times would kill a person born just a few centuries ago? They're funny and hyperbolic, but they're grounded in the fact that while the ways in which we produce things and share information have advanced wildly, the human brain has basically remained the same. We say it all the time but it bears repeating: We're just not cut out to handle the onslaught of stimuli we get on a daily basis.\n\nThink of how many times your phone lights up on a given day. I just checked my screentime app and discovered that though it's only early afternoon, I've gotten 150 notifications straight to my lock screen already today. It's only Wednesday, so I'm averaging 213 a day, which my phone assures me is down 20% from last week and I'm quite sure I'll pick back up by the time Sunday rolls around. Considering that a few months ago, I redid all my phone settings so not all of my notifications got blasted to my lock screen, this is concerning. That's just a lot of information to constantly see.\n\nAs it turns out, text-based info is the main cause of cognitive overload, at least according to one study. Emails, Slack and Teams messages, texts, calendar notifications—the never-ending stream of these bad boys is a major contributor to the overall feeling of being unable to process or do anything. If you think about an average day when you've felt too zapped to work, it probably included plenty of those. Audio-visual stimuli are less debilitating, according to the study, so a Zoom or phone call or a manager stopping by your desk may not trip you up as badly.\n\nBeyond feeling like you can't even think straight or like you're too overwhelmed to take action on any one task, you may be able to recognize cognitive overload from other signs. If incoming messages make you feel frustrated or detached, for instance, no matter what they say, this could be happening to you. That's actually the symptom I experience most often, for what it's worth. When I'm overwhelmed by too much information, I find myself thinking, \"What do you want?!\" every time my phone lights up, before I even see who is reaching out. (Sorry, Mom.)\n\nAs I was going through the study and thinking over cognitive overload, I realized I've already been implementing a few tricks that may have been helping me avoid it. As mentioned above, I banned my least-used apps from sending me notifications a few months ago. For years, I've also tinkered with my MacBook settings so I don't get any form of push notification on my computer. My phone is next to me at all times; there's no good reason for the top right corner of my laptop screen to be whacking me with the same notifications the phone is already showing me.\n\nA few other tried-and-true productivity approaches came to mind for me once I got a good grasp of what cognitive overload actually is. The one-touch rule of inbox management could be useful for you if you find that messages get you worked up. With that, you open each message as you get it and make an instant decision about what to do with the contents. It might seem counterintuitive to face each incoming message head-on if you're trying to avoid feeling burned out by the sheer volume of them, but I've found that when I see a message preview at the top of my screen and do nothing about it, it nags at me all day. Addressing it instantly helps me clear my mind and keep working.\n\nOtherwise, the way you go about battling this is going to be pretty subjective, although I do have one more recommendation: If you're not familiar with the Pomodoro technique, get familiar now. With it, you work for a set amount of time (usually 25 minutes) before taking a small break (usually five). When you're in those focus sessions, you should be completely distraction-free, putting your devices in Do Not Disturb mode or even using specialized apps to block other, distracting apps. Knowing you have to work seriously for a certain amount of time can help get you in the zone and push you away from information and decision paralysis while knowing you eventually get a break can help you stay relaxed as you go.",

I think it is good football gives him back this moment.\"",

And the boys are aware of that.\n\n\"What is the ideal number of contracts? Where do we put our spend into and what do we actually need?\"\n\nHarlequins saw off competition from Sale to retain England back-five forward Chandler Cunningham-South on a new contract in November, while Northampton full-back George Furbank is expected to move to the Twickenham Stoop for the start of next season.\n\nBristol second row James Dun has also been confirmed as a new arrival for 2026-27.\n\nFormer captain Stephen Lewies has been linked with a return to his native South Africa, external when his present deal expires at the end of the season, but Gilmore suggested other departures may be necessary as he looks for a smaller squad, combining quality and flexibility.\n\n\"You obviously need the right amount of contracts across all positions so that if you do get injuries, it's not like you're scrambling,\" he added.\n\n\"But what we're looking at is, can we be more efficient with our contracting?\"\n\nHarlequins have lost a host of big-name players in recent seasons, with the retirement of Joe Marler, Danny Care and Matt Symons coinciding with the departures of Andre Esterhuizen, Will Collier, Wilco Louw and Joe Marchant.\n\nGilmore said he was focused on reviving Harlequins' trademark attacking style, while emphasising the need for physicality in defence.\n\n\"How much are we prepared to fight?\" he added.\n\n\"It's just not about being on the back foot, it's about arresting momentum in the game and making sure that we keep on top.\"\n\nFlanker Jack Kenningham came through the club's academy, having been a regular at the Stoop as a boy.\n\n\"I put my body on the line every time I play for Quins - I love the club,\" said the 26-year-old.\n\n\"It means a lot to me, having been a season-ticket holder when I was about 11 years old. So it hurts me probably, potentially more than others when we do lose.\"",

Pep Guardiola will hope this season does not derail in similar fashion to last season.\n\nPatched up because of a growing list of injuries, City are seeing their title challenge fall apart. They have now drawn three games in a row. As Wednesday's match against Brighton finished 1-1, there were a few jeers at full-time.\n\nFrom 1 January to 1 February, City have a run of 10 games in four different competitions. It is an arduous sequence, one to push them to their limit. With draws against Sunderland, Chelsea and now Brighton, they have so far not been up to the test.\n\nIf Arsenal beat Liverpool on Thursday, City will be eight points off the top with 17 games to play.\n\n\"The result is the result,\" said Guardiola. \"One point for them, one point for us. It is what it is.\n\n\"The second half was quite similar against Sunderland and Chelsea - we missed the passes. I like a lot the way we play... many new players and many new things... but we don't score goals.\n\n\"Too many clear chances and all the people up front... unfortunately we could not score. Scoring goals is part of doing your job.\"",

    "description": "The program allows patients in the state to get prescription refills for 190 common meds.",
    "fullText": "The state of Utah is allowing artificial intelligence to prescribe medication refills to patients without direct human oversight in a pilot program public advocates call “dangerous.”\n\nThe program is through the state’s “regulatory sandbox” framework, which allows businesses to trial “innovative” products or services with state regulations temporarily waived. The Utah Department of Commerce partnered with Doctronic, a telehealth startup with an AI chatbot.\n\nDoctronic offers a nationwide service that allows patients to chat with its “AI doctor” for free, then, for $39, book a virtual appointment with a real doctor licensed in their state. But patients must go through the AI chatbot first to get an appointment.\n\nAccording to a non-peer-reviewed preprint article from Doctronic, which looked at 500 telehealth cases in its service, the company claims its AI’s diagnosis matched the diagnosis made by a real clinician in 81 percent of cases. The AI’s treatment plan was “consistent” with that of a doctor’s in 99 percent of the cases.\n\nNow, for patients in Utah, Doctronic’s chatbot can refill a prescription without a doctor, for a $4 service fee . After a patient signs in and verifies state residency, the AI chatbot can pull up the patient’s prescription history and offer a list of prescription medications eligible for a refill. According to Politico, the chatbot will only be able to renew prescriptions for 190 common medications for chronic conditions, with key exclusions, such as medications for pain and ADHD, and those that are injected.\n\nThe first 250 renewals for each drug class will be reviewed by real doctors, but after that, the AI chatbot will be on its own. Adam Oskowitz, Doctronic co-founder and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, told Politico that the AI chatbot is designed to err on the side of safety and escalate any case with uncertainty to a real doctor.\n\n“Utah’s approach to regulatory mitigation strikes a vital balance between fostering innovation and ensuring consumer safety,” Margaret Woolley Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nFor now, it’s unclear if the Food and Drug Administration will step in to regulate AI prescribing. On the one hand, prescription renewals are a matter of practicing medicine, which falls under state governance. However, Politico notes that the FDA has said that it has the authority to regulate medical devices used to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.\n\nIn a statement, Robert Steinbrook, health research group director at watchdog Public Citizen, blasted Doctronic’s program and the lack of oversight. “AI should not be autonomously refilling prescriptions, nor identifying itself as an ‘AI doctor,'” Steinbrook said.\n\n“Although the thoughtful application of AI can help to improve aspects of medical care, the Utah pilot program is a dangerous first step toward more autonomous medical practice,” he said.\"The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies cannot look the other way when AI applications undermine the essential human clinician role in prescribing and renewing medications.”",

Make sure to check out all the details for Season 1 Reloaded in Black Ops 7 and Warzone, including more weapons, multiplayer maps, and new Zombies content.\n\nBelow, we highlight all the new Fallout-themed game modes players can enjoy. This includes modes for multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and even the campaign's Endgame.\n\nIn the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Mayhem playlist, Black Ops 7's multiplayer maps are irradiated with toxic particles. These are 6v6 matches of Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint, and they feature \"S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs\" to help players keep their radiation at safe levels. The HUD features a Geiger counter to display exposure levels, and players will want to collect the buffs to avoid taking too much radiation damage.\n\nThe S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs include:\n\nThe Ghouls is a spin on Call of Duty's Infected mode. In this mode, players spawn into the match as Vault Dwellers on irritated multiplayer maps. They must scavenge for perks and RadAway to help them survive, and each eliminated Vault Dweller returns to the match as a ghoul fighting against the dwellers. Players must survive as Vault Dweller or infect everyone as a ghoul to win.\n\nThe Feral Ghouls and Deathclaws of Fallout invade both the Ashes of the Damned and Astra Malorum maps in this themed limited-time mode. In Project RADs, players are also exposed to increased levels of radiation with each passing round.\n\nThis changes the mode's usual means of healing and earning Essence. Instead, these are replaced with a system of drops given by fallen enemies that assist the crew in keeping rad levels at bay and gaining vital resources.\n\nWhile it's not exactly an LTM, players can hunt down Fallout's infamous Deathclaws in Endgame. Deathclaws can be found in matches as a limited-time world event. For this event, a bomb blast reduces a portion of Avalon into a Fallout-inspired wasteland with toxic air. Players can fight through hordes of feral ghouls to take on a Deathclaw hunt for rewards.\n\nPower Armor Royale is a Fallout-themed spin on battle royale. This features 66 players in trios on Verdansk, where power armor can be obtained from air drops. Players will need to charge up Fusion Cores in order to use any power armor, but the suit will grant the user a health boost, jetpack thrusters, upgraded weaponry, and the ability to eject and detonate the suit.",

    "fullText": "Some HSBC mobile banking customers in the UK report being locked out of the bank's app after installing the Bitwarden password manager via an open source app catalog.\n\nNeil Brown, board member at F-Droid, said he was blocked from accessing HSBC's UK mobile banking after a security screen flagged Bitwarden as a risk. Brown had installed the password manager via F-Droid rather than Google Play.\n\nBitwarden, an open source password manager, is available through official channels including Google Play and Galaxy stores, as well as via F-Droid sideloading.\n\nHSBC didn't provide The Register with a clear answer on why it won't allow a sideloaded Bitwarden installation to coexist with its app on the same device.\n\nRepresentatives from both F-Droid and Bitwarden suspect the issue stems from HSBC's side.\n\nGary Orenstein, chief customer officer at Bitwarden, told us: \"It seems that HSBC has chosen a level of security and permissions for their mobile app that allows the HSBC app to see if there are other apps on the phone not installed from the Google Play store, and if one is found, to disallow the install of the HSBC app.\"\n\nBrown said that \"as far as I know, this is a decision taken by HSBC unilaterally,\" and the issues are not caused by F-Droid itself.\n\nSome have opined that HSBC configured its app safety controls, Play Integrity, to forbid operation in such cases, although this remains unconfirmed.\n\n\"In terms of the technical details, I do not know,\" Brown told us. \"It could be down to SafeNet, but I do not know for sure. There might be technical workarounds, such as using banking apps within a separate profile on the device. Or – not ideal, because of the increased cost for the user – using a separate physical device for banking apps.\"\n\n\"My approach, driven by me testing postmarketOS, is to switch back from using apps to using the provider's website.\"\n\nHSBC's response gave little away. A spokesperson said: \"Protecting our customers' accounts and personal information is our priority. Our app performs checks to identify potential malware risks and can require users to take additional steps to keep their accounts safe.\"\n\nBoth Bitwarden and F-Droid said they are open to discussing the matter with the bank, although we understand no meetings have yet been scheduled. ®",

Those new chapters added new regions of Tamriel for players to explore, additional story content, optional paid DLCs, and, occasionally, things like new classes and systems.\nZeniMax Online announced in 2024 that going forward, ESO wouldn't have a traditional yearly chapter release, labeling 2025 as a \"transitional\" year as the team prepared to focus on its plans for 2026. In a recent livestream and subsequent press Q&A attended by GameSpot, the developers have now revealed what ESO's 2026 will look like, and it includes more experimental seasonal content, battle passes, new story content, solo dungeons, a PvP progression system, class reworks, and more.",

    "description": "John...",
    "fullText": "Her victory was won by the precariat: renters, transit riders, and democratic socialists who rallied, rang doorbells, created social media, and registered new voters.\n\nA day after Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration, 3,000 miles west of New York, the people of Seattle celebrated their own democratic socialist miracle, swearing in Mayor Katie Wilson. Katie beat the odds in unseating a powerful incumbent with an agenda rooted in equity and an authenticity that appealed to the city’s most precarious voters.\n\nI was lucky enough to be among the speakers at Wilson’s inauguration, which, unlike Mamdani’s, was purposefully not star-studded. There were very few suits. Mayor Wilson’s clothes were purchased at Goodwill. One thousand Seattleites crowded into City Hall, hundreds of whom had never thought of it as their home. Along with me, Katie invited three speakers who presented a mosaic of hope: a Somali American graduate student, a formerly homeless man, and an elder who reminded us over and over again to be courageous and not content.\n\nWhile Zohran was sworn in by Senator Bernie Sanders, Katie was sworn in by Pauline Van Senus, a low-income transit rider known as Seattle’s “transit fairy” for cleaning bus stops throughout the city.\n\nKatie’s victory was won by the precariat: renters, transit riders, and democratic socialists who rallied around Katie, rang doorbells for her, created dominant social media, and registered new voters.\n\nThese are not the recognized power brokers of Seattle, but Katie’s win shows they can mobilize and inspire the grassroots to elect a mayor who embraces working-class values and policy that will enable residents to thrive—including affordable childcare, transit, and housing.\n\nNow the challenge Katie faces is to universalize childcare and social housing. In previous decades, progressives have tried to create progress with incremental victories in an overwhelmingly powerful corporate context. I know this work firsthand as a longtime advocate for progressive economic policy. I’ve seen the pitfalls of this approach. It is time for fundamental, systemic, and universal progress for Seattle. Katie can bring it.\n\nIt won’t be easy, as the Trump administration and Congress are stripping funding from social services such as childcare and healthcare. Though Seattle has the means to fund these social goods, we are about to find out if our leaders have the political gumption to tax the oligarchs, the affluent, and the global corporations headquartered in Seattle, including Amazon and Starbucks.\n\nKatie has never shied away from confronting corporate power. Her first stop after the election was at a Starbucks picket line, where she proclaimed, “I’m not buying Starbucks and you should not either.” It’s not just lip service: Katie originated the JumpStart tax on large corporations.\n\nWith the election of three progressives, she now has allies on the City Council. She has built a grassroots movement that could be engaged in initiative campaigns if the City Council refuses to act. That’s how we may end up building our city. As Katie’s swearing-in ceremony demonstrated beautifully, Seattle’s new mayor has built a coalition of community organizations, workers, activists, immigrants, Democrats, socialists, childcare workers, and small businesses to win her election. Now that coalition must be plugged into actual policy advancement.\n\nKatie’s platform is about more than creating a thriving economic community. It’s also about setting the conditions that allow everyday people to enjoy the simple pleasures of life—to walk in a park, to have time to read a book. Watching Mamdani’s swearing-in from Seattle, I was moved to tears as Lucy Dacus sang “Bread and Roses.” In Seattle, Katie, echoing these lyrics, affirmed that we must open up “the time and space where life happens, where people can breathe and experience and create, where we can be full human beings and not just means to an end.… Because we need bread, but we need roses too. We deserve roses.”",

    "fullText": "Darren Michael, associate professor at Austin Peay State University, has reportedly been reinstated and given $500,000 after being fired over posts about assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nTennessee’s WKRN News 2 obtained a copy of a settlement agreement between Michael and the university, showing the school will dish out $500,000 and reimburse “therapeutic counseling services.”\n\n“APSU agrees to issue a statement acknowledging regret for not following the tenure termination process in connection with the Dispute,” the settlement reportedly reads. “The statement will be distributed via email through APSU’s reasonable communication channels to faculty, staff, and students.”\n\nThe university confirmed to WZTV in Nashville that Michael returned to his faculty position at the end of December.\n\nMichael was fired on Sept. 12 (two days after the assassination of Kirk) after social media posts about Kirk spread far and wide on social media.\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) brought attention to one post and included Michael’s photo and biography.\n\n“What do you say, [Augstin Peay]?” she wrote.\n\nWhat do you say, @austinpeay? pic.twitter.com/dTgCe4iv5l\n\n— Marsha Blackburn (@VoteMarsha) September 12, 2025\n\n“Charlie Kirk says gun deaths are ‘unfortunately’ worth it to keep 2nd Amendment,” read the headline of an article Michael shared. He did not add any additional comment on it.\n\nThe school originally said Michael was fired over “insensitive comments” made on social media.\n\n“Such actions do not align with Austin Peay’s commitment to mutual respect and human dignity,” APSU President Mike Licari said in a statement. “The university deems these actions unacceptable and has terminated the faculty member.”\n\nLicari acknowledged in a new statement that the school did not follow proper procedures in regards to Michael.\n\n“APSU did not follow the required termination process in this matter, and I deeply regret and apologize for the impact this has had on Professor Michael and on our campus community,” the university president said. “I am committed to ensuring that due process and fairness are upheld in all future actions.”\n\nThe post Professor Fired for Charlie Kirk Post Gets $500,000 From School, Is Reinstated first appeared on Mediaite.",

The driver of the truck, a 40-year-old man, was not hurt and will be subject to drug and alcohol testing, which police say is standard procedure.\n\n“Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of both the deceased,” police continued. “A report will be prepared for the coroner.”\n\nAn investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, and the Tasmania Police did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\n\nFollowing the tragic incident, a family friend, Ella Mackrell, launched a GoFundMe to help bring the teen’s body home, as well as cover expenses related to travel, lodging and the funeral.\n\nThe 16-year-old girl, identified as Adasyn Wood Savin, hailed from Newcastle, New South Wales and was visiting Rosebury during the school holiday and riding in the ATV with a family friend, according to the donation page.\n\n“She was having fun, spending time with friends, and making memories the way any 16-year-old should,” wrote Mackrell, who did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\n\n“Tragically, while riding...Adasyn and one of our beloved friends, Whitt, were hit by a car and both of them passed away at the scene,” she continued.\n\n“As Adasyn leaves us behind, we think about her parents, Amber and Adam, her brothers James Savin and Hayden Wood, and the rest of the family,” Mackrell continued, “who are now facing life without their beautiful sister, cousin, and friend.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nMackrell went on to write that the Adasyn and her brother Cooper — who previously passed away — are now \"together again, watching over their family from the stars.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday, Jan. 7, the online donation page has raised over $17,000.",

    "description": "The U.S. Navy has some of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Its newest addition is named after an important World War II ship.",
    "fullText": "The United States Navy has the largest fleet of nuclear submarines on the planet, and it just added a new one to the inventory. This new fifth generation submarine is an incredible machine, and it was named in honor of one of World War II's biggest and best vessels. On December 15, 2025, the U.S. Navy took ownership of the USS Idaho (SSN-799). The ship was named to carry on the honor of the battleship USS Idaho (BB-42), which was first commissioned in 1919 and went on to be awarded seven battle stars during WWII.\n\nThe new Idaho is the 26th Virginia-class boat. The ship is the fifth U.S. Navy vessel to carry the name \"Idaho. The first was a wooden steam sloop that was turned into a full-rigged sailing ship commissioned in 1866. The second was the BB-24, a Mississippi-class battleship. During World War I, motorboat SP-545 also carried the name before \"Idaho\" was transferred to a New Mexico-class battleship of WWII. That warship was known as \"The Big Spud\" for the state's most famous crop.\n\nIt's common for the U.S. Navy to reuse ship names in honor of historical vessels. The most well-known example is probably the USS Enterprise, as there have been nine thusly-named vessels, three of which are aircraft carriers. The new USS Idaho will undergo a series of sea trials prior to its official commissioning, which will likely take place sometime in the spring of 2026. In the meantime, dedicated submariners will get to know the boat, which is expected to help strengthen the nation's undersea warfare capabilities.\n\nThe USS Idaho (SSN-799) is one of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Virginia-class subs are designated to be attack platforms with the capability to launch cruise missiles. They're used primarily for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering, and they can operate in blue-water oceans as well as in littoral areas along coastlines. The class is slowly replacing the cruise-missile variant of the Ohio class and other nuclear submarines in the Los Angeles class.\n\nAs of this writing, three Virginia-class boats are earmarked for the Royal Australian Navy, while the rest remain with the U.S. Navy. The USS Idaho measures 377 feet long with a displacement of 10,200 tons of seawater when submerged. The boat utilizes an S9G reactor alongside an auxiliary diesel engine and has a maximum speed of around 29 mph. Like other vessels of its class, the Idaho will be home to 128 enlisted personnel and 17 officers.\n\nBecause the boat is powered by nuclear energy, it has virtually an unlimited range and will likely remain in service for at least 40 years. In terms of armament, the USS Idaho features two Virginia Payload Tubes and four additional payload tubes capable of firing the BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile. Additionally, it features four 21-inch torpedo tubes to fire the U.S. Navy's MK-48 heavy torpedo.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth aggressively jumped in to cut off Secretary of State Marco Rubio to yell at a reporter on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe two Cabinet members had just come out of a meeting to brief senators on the U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and explain the path forward.\n\nRubio had been taking a series of questions from reporters when he was asked about how much involvement in Venezuela would cost U.S. taxpayers before being cut off.\n\nThe secretary of state insisted it would not cost the U.S. any money and claimed the oil deal would not either.\n\n“None of these troops sit in a dry dock waiting for action,” Rubio said. “They’re deployed somewhere in the world. If they’re not here, they’re somewhere else.”\n\nHe argued that if the ships were not in the Caribbean, they would be ”somewhere else conducting activity.”\n\nHegseth had been standing by, at times smirking, as Rubio spoke, but then he stepped forward, forcing the Secretary of State to shift aside, so he could chime in.\n\n“I want to emphasize that question from CNN,” Hegseth said, glaring at the reporter Manu Raju before launching a verbal attack.\n\n“The questions never asked how much does it cost when they’re in the Mediterranean, or the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean or the Pacific, but now that they’re in our hemisphere and a counter cartel mission or ensuring an indicted individual comes to justice, now now you’re asking the question of cost,” Hegseth raged, gesturing his hand for emphasis. “It’s a disingenuous question to begin with.”\n\nBut the defense secretary did not stop there as he continued to rant at the reporter who tried to respond.\n\n“You’re trying to find any angle possible to undermine the success of one of the most historic military missions the world has ever seen,” Hegseth declared.\n\nThe defense secretary went on to claim that the operation in Venezuela was one that only the U.S. could accomplish and argued the world is “taking notice of that.”\n\nHe went on to tout the seizure of oil tankers being pursued by the U.S.\n\nWhile Rubio had been taking questions, Hegseth ignored follow-up attempts from reporters and instead spoke louder.\n\n“Our military is prepared to continue this as he said,” Hegseth said, gesturing back to Rubio. “The president when he speaks, he means it, means it. He’s not messing around. We’re an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”\n\nHe then quickly stepped back without taking a single question as Rubio pointed out that the officials needed to go brief members of the House.\n\nHegseth ignored questions and beat a hasty retreat as questions were yelled about whether the U.S. would put boots on the ground and more.\n\nBefore the defense secretary’s rant in front of the cameras, Rubio attempted to lay out the Trump administration’s plan for Venezuela and insisted that, despite criticism, they’re not just winging it.\n\nHe outlined that stabilizing the country relied heavily on the “quarantine” as leverage and execution of a deal to take the oil out of Venezuela. He repeated the claim that the U.S. would take out 30 to 50 million barrels of oil and sell it.\n\n“That money would then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime,” Rubio argued.\n\nThe secretary of state said the second phase would be making sure the U.S. has access to the Venezuelan market that’s “fair.” He said the third phase would be the transition. He did not provide a timeline.\n\nDemocratic senators coming out of the briefing slammed the Trump administration’s plan and warned many questions were left unanswered.\n\n“This is an insane plan. They are talking about stealing the Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time undefined as leverage to micromanage the country,” said Senator Chris Murphy. “The scope and insanity of that plan is absolutely stunning.”",

    "description": "Taiwan is searching for a missing F-16 fighter jet and pilot after an incident earlier this week.",
    "fullText": "A Taiwanese F-16 fighter jet and its pilot went missing off the island's northeast coast on Tuesday.\n\nTaiwan's Air Force has grounded its F-16 fleet and suspended training missions in response.\n\nSearch and rescue operations are still ongoing. Right now, it's unclear whether the pilot ejected.\n\nTaiwan's air force has grounded its F-16 fleet and suspended training missions on the jet after one of the planes and the pilot went missing earlier this week.\n\nThe search continues for the pilot and aircraft, which officials believe went down following an in-flight \"anomaly,\" but rough seas off the island have made efforts difficult.\n\nOn Tuesday night local time, an American-made F-16 fighter jet assigned to the Taiwan Air Force's Fifth Tactical Air Wing operating out of Hualien Air Base went missing in the waters off the northeast coast of the island. The Air Force said the fighter was separated from a group during a nighttime training session after the jets entered cloud cover.\n\nThe F-16 suddenly descended quickly. Its altitude was just 1,700 feet when radar contact was lost. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has identified the missing pilot as Capt. Hsin Po-yi. Officials remain unsure whether Hsin successfully ejected from the aircraft, although he had indicated he would eject seconds before the aircraft disappeared. It's unclear if he did.\n\nIn the days since the incident, a search and rescue mission has been ongoing in the waters off Hualien County. Multiple aircraft and vessels have been involved in the mission, but tall waves and strong winds have been complicating the search for the jet and Hsin.\n\nAir Force officials told reporters during a press conference on Wednesday that there appeared to be a malfunction of the F-16's main onboard computer in which the aircraft's flight path was no longer displayed.\n\nNow, Taiwanese air force officials have grounded all of Taiwan's F-16 fleet for inspections, and training missions have been temporarily suspended. Taiwan currently has about 140 F-16s, the older A/B models, that it has upgraded in recent years. It is expected to receive a batch of the newer F-16V or Viper jets in the coming years to add to its fleet.\n\nThe F-16 is made by American defense giant Lockheed Martin. Though it's been flying for over 50 years, it still represents a highly capable fourth-generation jet. The newest operator of the aircraft is Ukraine, which received a limited number from NATO partner nations.\n\nThis crash involving the Taiwanese military follows a similar incident that occurred in January 2022, when a Taiwanese F-16 went down off the island's west coast while taking part in training exercises. At the time, the F-16 went missing after taking off from Chiayi Air Base in southern Taiwan. In response, Taiwan suspended its combat training for the fleet.\n\nIt's not uncommon to see fleets grounded after accidents, especially if the cause is unclear. The US military has done this regularly.\n\nTaiwan's Air Force has been strained in recent years by constant scrambling to track Chinese military aircraft, which regularly fly into the country's air defense identification zone. Taipei's smaller air force has experienced higher operational tempos that have exhausted pilots, aircraft, and resources and stressed maintainers. Most recently, Taiwan held rapid response drills in reaction to China's massive exercises nearby.",

    "title": "Common food preservatives linked to cancer and type 2 diabetes",
    "description": "Two large studies found a significant association between eating preservatives in many foods and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and several cancers.",
    "fullText": "Common preservatives used to keep food safe and extend shelf life may be linked to a higher risk of several cancers and type 2 diabetes, according to two new studies from France.\n\n“These are very important findings for preservatives that are not only widely used in the French and European markets, but also in the United States,” said senior author Mathilde Touvier, principal investigator of the NutriNet-Santé study used to conduct the research.\n\nThe NutriNet-Santé study, which began in 2009, compares over 170,000 participants’ web-based reports on diet and lifestyle with their medical data stored in the French national health care system.\n\n“These are the two first studies in the world investigating the associations between exposure to these food additives and cancer and type 2 diabetes,” said Touvier, who is also the director of research at France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris, “and so we must be very cautious about the message. Obviously, the results need to be confirmed.”\n\nDespite those caveats, “the concern raised about preservatives is one more reason among many to emphasize the personal and public health importance of fresh, whole, minimally processed foods, mostly plants,” Dr. David Katz said in an email.\n\nKatz, who was not involved in the study, is a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.\n\nThe cancer study, published Wednesday in The BMJ journal, closely examined the impact of 58 preservatives on some 105,000 people who were free of cancer in 2009 and were followed for up to 14 years. Only those who completed frequent 24-hour, brand-specific food questionnaires were included. People who ate the most preservative-laced food were compared with those who ate the least.\n\nResearchers did a deep dive on 17 preservatives consumed by at least 10% of the participants and found 11 of those had no relationship with cancer. However, the six that were linked to cancer are considered GRAS, or “generally recognized as safe” in food by the US Food and Drug Administration. Those include sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, sorbates, potassium metabisulfite, acetates and acetic acid.\n\nSodium nitrite, a chemical salt commonly used in processed meats such as bacon, ham and deli meats, was associated with a 32% increase in the risk of prostate cancer. It’s cousin, potassium nitrate, was associated with a 22% higher risk of breast cancer and a 13% increase in all cancers. The World Health Organization has long considered processed meat as a carcinogen, with a direct link to colon cancer.\n\nSorbates, especially potassium sorbate, were associated with a 26% higher risk for breast cancer and a 14% increase in all types of cancers. These water-soluble salts are used in wine, baked goods, cheeses and sauces to prevent molds, yeast and some bacteria.\n\nPotassium metabisulfite, often used in winemaking and brewing, was associated with a 20% increase in breast cancer and 11% higher risk of all cancers, according to the study.\n\nAcetates, which come from natural fermentation and are used in foods such as meat, sauces, breads and cheese, were linked to a 25% higher risk of breast cancer and 15% increase in cancer in general. Acetic acid, the main ingredient in vinegar, was associated with a 12% increase in the risk of all cancers, the study found.\n\nOther types of preservatives — antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, plant extracts like rosemary and such synthetic preservatives as butylated hydroxyanisole — were also studied. While these more “natural” preservatives are often linked to lower cancer risk when eaten as whole foods, they may be harmful when used as additives, Touvier said.\n\n“The hypothesis here is when you isolate one substance from its original matrix of a whole fruit or vegetable, the action on our health can be different depending on the way our gut microbiota will digest it,” she said.\n\nOnly two antioxidant preservatives were linked to cancer, the study found. Sodium erythorbate and other erythorbates, which are made from fermented sugars, were associated with a 21% higher incidence of breast cancer and 12% increase in cancer overall.\n\nErythorbates are used to prevent discoloration and spoilage in poultry, soft drinks and baked goods, to name a few. Sodium erythorbate is often used in processed meats to speed up the curing process.\n\nObservational studies are subject to error due to the lack of control over variables that might also influence outcomes. However, a major strength of this study was its ability to adjust for preservatives from natural sources and other food additives as well as its “detailed assessment of preservative intake, through repeated 24-hour dietary records,” according to an editorial published with the study.\n\n“We also looked at what colleagues have published on the impact of these preservative chemicals on animal models, cellular models, gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammatory processes which may explain what we observe,” Touvier said.\n\nIn addition, both studies controlled for such confounding factors as a physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, medication use and lifestyle factors, Touvier said.\n\n“The finding that specific classes of preservatives are associated with increased risk of select cancers was robust to all of these adjustments, indicating it is a matter that warrants respect and requires further research,” Katz said.\n\nThe type 2 diabetes study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications, examined the role of preservatives and the potential risk of type 2 diabetes in nearly 109,000 of the NutriNet-Santé participants who did not have the disease at the start of the study.\n\nTwelve of the 17 preservatives researchers examined were linked with nearly a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people who consumed the highest levels.\n\nFive of the same preservatives that caused cancer — potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic acid and sodium acetate — also raised the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In this case the probability rose by 49%, according to the research.\n\nA sixth preservative — calcium propionate — was also connected. It’s a white powder used to stop mold and bacterial growth.\n\nIn this study on type 2 diabetes, more than two antioxidant additives increased risk. Additives that increased risk by 42% included alpha-tocopherol, the most bioavailable form of vitamin E; sodium ascorbate, which is a buffered form of vitamin C and sodium; rosemary extracts; sodium erythorbate, made from fermented sugar; phosphoric acid, a preservative in sodas, processed meats, cheeses and other foods; and citric acid, a flavor enhancer, preservative and pH adjuster with no significant nutritional value.\n\nSince these two studies are the first to examine the role of preservatives in the development of cancer and type 2 diabetes, much more research will be required to confirm and expand the findings, said Anaïs Hasenböhler, the first author of both studies who is a doctoral student at the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team at the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord.\n\nHowever, Hasenböhler added in a statement, “These new data add to others in favour of a reassessment of the regulations governing the general use of food additives by the food industry in order to improve consumer protection.”\n\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.",

    "fullText": "McDonald’s stock has been languishing due to slower earnings growth.\n\nThe company’s recession-resistant business model may appeal to risk-averse investors.\n\nMcDonald’s predictable cash flow from franchisees supports future dividend raises.\n\n10 stocks we like better than McDonald's ›\n\nWith the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) hovering around an all-time high, some investors may be more interested in cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) stocks than a stodgy fast food giant like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD). After all, selling burgers and fries may lack the glitz and glamour of a high-octane growth story, but it can be just the ticket for powering your passive income stream in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHere's why McDonald's is a top Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) component to buy in January.\n\nLast October, McDonald's raised its dividend for the 49th consecutive year -- putting McDonald's on track to become a Dividend King in 2026.\n\nDividend Kings are companies that have raised their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years. To pull off that feat, companies must consistently grow earnings so they can afford the higher dividend expense. The dividend becomes a key priority for returning capital to shareholders and managing investor expectations.\n\nHowever, plenty of Dividend Kings are stodgy, slow-growing consumer staples and industrial companies. Unlike Dividend Kings that are past their prime, McDonald's is an ultra-high-margin cash cow with a track record of rewarding shareholders with solid returns on top of the dividend -- with McDonald's producing a 229% total return over the last decade. But McDonald's has cooled, with the stock up just under 15% in the last three years compared to a nearly 80% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nThe restaurant industry has been under pressure because it depends on consumer discretionary spending. Sit-down restaurants that rely on experiences have been struggling the most, whereas restaurants that cater to convenience and value are doing relatively better.\n\nIn McDonald's latest quarter, which was the third quarter of 2025, comparable sales increased by 3.6% and systemwide sales grew by 8% year over year. Systemwide revenue refers to McDonald's restaurants that are corporate-owned or franchised.\n\nSimilarly, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR), which is a quick-service restaurant conglomerate that owns Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes, and Firehouse Subs, grew systemwide sales by 6.9% in the third quarter of 2025, including 4% comparable sales growth.",

    "description": "\"I want to properly understand.\"",
    "fullText": "Tens of thousands of years ago, a new study suggests, a warming event led to the release of carbon dioxide from deep in the Southern Ocean. Now, scientists say, these findings could shed light on the potential fallout from continued warming in the Antarctic.\n\nLed by scientists at the Laoshan Laboratory in Qingdao, China, and Germany's GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, the study looked at sediment cores from the Southern Ocean to understand the behavior of Antarctic Bottom Water, or AABW.\n\n​​\"We wanted to understand how the influence of Antarctic Bottom Water, the coldest and densest water mass in the global ocean, changed during the last deglaciation, and what role it played in the global carbon cycle,\" said Huang Huang, who led the study, in a GEOMAR press release.\n\nThe researchers' findings, published recently in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggest that AABW expansion helped bring the last Ice Age to an end.\n\n\"As the planet warmed and the ice sheets melted between about 18,000 and 10,000 years ago, the volume of Antarctic Bottom Water expanded in two distinct phases,\" according to the release.\n\n\"These phases coincided with known warming events in Antarctica. As vertical mixing in the Southern Ocean increased, the carbon that had been stored in the deep ocean was able to return to the atmosphere.\"\n\nThe research team found that the deepest waters stayed fairly stagnant and out of touch with shallower waters until the Earth began to warm. When the water was stirred up by the expansion created by the warming of the planet, carbon stores were released into the Earth's atmosphere, forcing temperatures higher.\n\nThe team's study goes back tens of thousands of years and thousands of meters down into the ocean. But its insights could be relevant today and on land where countless communities are vulnerable to the impacts of rising global temperatures.\n\n\"Comparisons with the past are always imperfect, but ultimately it comes down to how much energy is in the system,\" said GEOMAR geochemist Marcus Gutjahr, per the release. \"If we understand how the ocean responded to warming in the past, we can better grasp what is happening today as Antarctic ice shelves continue to melt.\"\n\nDeep Southern Ocean waters have warmed faster than most others in the past half-century. If the warming waters and thawing ice repeat the patterns of the past, huge amounts of carbon could be released into the atmosphere again and contribute to subsequent temperature rise.\n\nShould we be pouring money into nuclear fusion technology?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"I want to properly understand the modern ocean in order to interpret signals from the past,\" Gutjahr said. \"If we can trace how Antarctic Bottom Water has changed over the last few thousand years, we can assess more accurately how rapidly the Antarctic Ice Sheet may continue to lose mass in the future.\"\n\nOther studies have shown that sea ice levels have dropped alarmingly over the last 50 years.\n\nAdvances in this field could help world leaders and global organizations prepare for the potentially catastrophic consequences of continued planetary warming. Evidence about the threats of sea level rise, food system disruptions, and disease spread can inform adaptation strategies.\n\nBut such alarming findings could also help stir meaningful public action now to mitigate rising temperatures, such as transitioning to cleaner home energy systems and transportation options.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The Michigan parents were on the hook for up to $15,000 worth of damage",
    "fullText": "Michigan parents have claimed insurance company Geico refused to cover their car crash because their young children weren’t listed on their policy.\n\nKara Vogel and Carson Howatt of Chelsea got into a crash on Christmas Eve last month with their 1-and-a-half-year-old daughter and 3-month-old son. Howatt told local news no one was injured in the minor crash.\n\n“We were going through a roundabout and a driver came on our right side and just didn’t yield to the roundabout and just hit us right in the front of our car,” Vogel told local news outlet Click On Detroit.\n\nThe damage to the family’s car could cost between $5,000 and $15,000. The parents said they were told it wouldn’t be covered since their children were not listed on their insurance policy. The family has used Geico since they bought their car six months ago, before their son was even born.\n\n“They asked if they are my kids and if they lived with me,” Howatt said. “I didn’t think anything of it, so, I was, like, ‘Yes, of course, they are my kids and they live with me and they were in the car when the accident occurred, in their car seats, but no one was hurt.’”\n\nHowatt admitted he signed a form stating that he and his wife were the only ones in their household.\n\n“We weren’t thinking, like, ‘This is going to completely ruin our financial situation.’ It didn’t seem big. The airbags didn’t go off,” Vogel said.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the family and to Geico for comment.\n\nGeico explained in a statement to Click On Detroit that “all household residents must be listed on the auto policy, regardless of age,” according to Michigan law. The state reformed no-fault auto insurance in 2019, including Personal Injury Protection requirements.\n\nThe issue was eventually resolved and the family said they won’t have to pay out of pocket. But they said Geico told them they would need to add their children to their policy.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance interest rates. The 30-year fixed rate has seen little movement since October. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates have sustained a long stretch of stability. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate is 6.01%, down three basis points. Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed home loan rate is up four basis points to 5.45%. These small moves in either direction have been the norm for many weeks.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.01% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the last cut to the federal funds rate in December, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates have been stuck in a rut — but there was a general move lower over the past couple of months. According to Freddie Mac data, 30-year mortgage rates remain about a half-point below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.\n\nZillow Home Loans isn’t just a marketplace — it’s also a mortgage lender with conventional, FHA, and VA loans, to name a few.

    "fullText": "An 18-year-old student charged with murder in the stabbing death of a classmate was denied bond on Wednesday.\n\nAundre Matthews is accused of killing Andrew Meismer after a fight between the two escalated during a science class at Sterling High School in Baytown, according to court records. Investigators say the dispute began over a $21 vape pen Matthews said was missing and believed that Meismer took.\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Cory Scott, an investigator with the Goose Creek Police Department, testified to seeing \"quite a bit\" of blood in the classroom, on the floor, and splattered on the wall on the day of the incident.\n\nWednesday's hearing was also one of the first under the new state law in which a prosecutor can request a defendant be held with no bond in non-capital offenses.\n\n\"It's brand new. This is the constitutional amendment that, as we've talked about, gives prosecutors and the judiciary another tool in the toolbox to ensure that people (who) shouldn't be out get to stay in,\" Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare said following Matthews' hearing.\n\nDuring the hearing, Matthews showed no visible emotion as prosecutors and defense attorneys argued whether he should be eligible for bond. Meismer's family was present in the courtroom.\n\nDetective Scott also presented surveillance video from inside the school. While the video was not released publicly, prosecutors described footage showing Matthews and Meismer entering an empty science lab together. Minutes later, a teacher's aide was seen pushing Matthews out of the room.\n\nProsecutors told the judge that Matthews stabbed Meismer inside the lab and argued that Matthews poses an ongoing threat to the community.\n\n\"It took over a minute to pry this defendant from this victim,\" a prosecutor said in court, adding that Matthews allegedly held Meismer in a chokehold as blood poured from his wounds.\n\nThe state also introduced Matthews' school disciplinary records, which prosecutors said showed an escalating pattern of behavior, including a prior incident in which he allegedly brought a knife to school.\n\nJudge Emily Detoto cited those school records as a key factor in her decision to deny bond.\n\n\"The school records are voluminous,\" DA Teare said, \"and they indicate an escalating pattern of behavior.\"\n\nMatthews' defense attorney, Gian Paolo Mecerola, said he was not surprised by the ruling but argued that responsibility also lies with the school district. He noted that Matthews was part of a special education program and said the district was aware of behavioral concerns but allowed him to continue attending school.\n\n\"There are clearly issues here,\" Mecerola said, adding that Matthews is being raised by his sister, who is his legal guardian. He said he is continuing to investigate those circumstances.\n\nDistrict Attorney Teare emphasized that the hearing was not a determination of guilt or innocence. Instead, he said, it was narrowly focused on whether Matthews should remain in custody while the case moves forward. The case has not yet been presented to a grand jury, and no trial date has been set.\n\n\"This is whole new for everyone,\" Teare said of the bond denial process. \"We don't have a full-time frame yet.\"\n\nAndrew Meissmer's family attended the hearing but declined to comment afterward.\n\nThe case remains in its early stages, and Matthews will continue to be held without bond as the legal process continues.\n\nHigh school student dies after being stabbed by a classmate in Baytown, Goose Creek CISD says\n\nHarris County DA's office accepts murder charge for teen accused in classmate's stabbing: Officials\n\n$3 million bond for student accused of stabbing friend in school, as school district stays quiet\n\nFor news updates, follow Miya Shay on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "description": "-Mughrabi Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man.",
    "fullText": "Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man. On December 29, Hamas announced that he had died, aged 49, around seven months after Israel said it killed him in a strike.\n\nHamas did not provide details on Sinwar's death but ​said it mourned him along with other group leaders, describing them as \"heroic martyrs\". Hamas confirmed in the statement that Sinwar had been the head of the group's armed forces.\n\nSinwar was elevated ‌to the top ranks of Hamas in 2024 after the death in combat of his brother Yahya, mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel that led to the war in Gaza and later overall leader of the Palestinian organisation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ‌in May 2025 that Sinwar had been killed. Less than two weeks later, the Israeli army said it had retrieved Sinwar's body in an underground tunnel beneath a hospital in southern Gaza.\n\nSinwar's death is expected to leave his next in command Izzeldeen Haddad, who had been overseeing operations in northern Gaza, in charge of Hamas' armed wing across the whole of the enclave.\n\nIt is unclear how the death will affect decision-making in Hamas more broadly - for example, whether it will bolster or diminish the influence of exiled members of the group's leadership council on policy matters, in particular the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire plan agreed with Israel in October.\n\nHamas officials described ⁠Sinwar as a \"ghost\" who long outfoxed Israel's intelligence agencies.\n\nLike his brother Yahya, Sinwar ‌had survived many Israeli assassination attempts, including airstrikes and planted explosives, Hamas sources said.\n\nWhen Sinwar once visited a cemetery, his comrades discovered a remote-controlled explosive resembling a brick planted along his path, according to the Hamas sources.\n\nIn 2003, Hamas operatives discovered a bomb in the wall of Mohammad Sinwar's house, foiling an assassination attempt that the ‍group blamed on Israeli intelligence.\n\nKnown for clandestine operations, Mohammad Sinwar played a central role in planning and executing Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the country's worst security failure, Hamas sources said.\n\nHe was also widely believed to have been one of the masterminds of the 2006 cross-border attack and abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.\n\nHamas held Shalit for five years before he was swapped for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel.\n\nUnder the deal, his brother Yahya Sinwar, whose ​meticulous planning for the 2023 attack shattered Israel's reputation as an invincible power in a hostile region, was among those who were released.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to eradicate Hamas. The offensive against ‌Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces, the Middle East's most advanced military, severely weakened the organisation.\n\nYahya Sinwar was killed in combat during a routine Israeli patrol in Gaza in 2024.\n\nIsrael released footage of a severely wounded Yahya Sinwar throwing a piece of wood at a hovering drone - his last act of defiance towards his old foe before his death and his brother's rise.\n\nBut the group, which was created during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in 1987 and which carried out suicide bombings that traumatised Israelis in the second one, is still standing.\n\nBorn on September 16, 1975, Sinwar rarely appeared in public or spoke to the media. He granted a lengthy interview to Al Jazeera for a documentary broadcast in 2022, but wore a cap and sat in the dark to hide his appearance.\n\nThe Sinwars originally came from Asqalan - now the Israeli ⁠city of Ashkelon, a short distance to the north of the Gaza Strip. Alongside hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, ​they became refugees in what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, at the time of Israel's declaration of independence during the ​1948 war.\n\nThe family settled in Khan Younis in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble in the latest war.\n\nMohammad Sinwar was educated in schools run by the United Nations' Palestinian relief agency (UNRWA), which has long been a target of Israeli criticism, including during the recent war in Gaza.\n\nHe joined Hamas shortly after its founding, influenced by his brother ‍Yahya, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the ⁠oldest and at one time most influential Islamist group in the Middle East.\n\nHis reputation as a hardliner helped him rise through the group's military ranks. By 2005, he was leading Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade.\n\nThe unit, one of the largest and most powerful battalions in Hamas' armed wing, has been responsible for cross-border attacks, firing rockets and planting bombs along the frontier. “Striking Tel Aviv is easier than ⁠drinking water,\" Sinwar told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe unit also watches the movements of Israeli soldiers around the clock. In 2006, elite commandos led by Sinwar took part in Shalit's abduction.\n\nSources close to Hamas say Sinwar developed close ties with Marwan Issa, the deputy commander ‌of Hamas' military wing, and Mohammed Deif, the aloof military chief. Both men were killed by Israel in 2024.\n\nIn its statement announcing Sinwar's death on December 29, Hamas said that ‌he had succeeded Deif.",

Vice-chair Greg Abel took over the top job as of Jan. 1, 2026 while Buffett will remain as chairman.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nDespite this shake-up, Buffett is confident about Berkshire Hathaway’s legacy.\n\n“It has a better chance I think of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,” Buffett said during an interview with CNBC (2).\n\nWith a net worth like his, you might anticipate Buffett living out a lavish retirement.\n\nBut unlike the high-roller lifestyles of other extremely rich celebrities and business people, Warren Buffett lives by smart — and surprisingly simple — investment philosophies that have positively influenced millions of investors around the world. One of his most famous rules is to buy and hold for as long as possible.\n\n“You’ve got to be prepared when you buy a stock to have it go down 50% or more, and be comfortable with it … but some people are not really careful,” Buffett said during Berkshire Hathaway’s 2020 annual shareholder meeting (3).\n\n“Some people are more subject to fear than others.”\n\nHere’s how to fight the fear and build a better future.\n\nMarket volatility isn’t exactly a foreign concept for the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett began investing when he was 11, back in 1942. Having lived through several recessions, Buffett has, time and again, shrugged off short-term market volatility.\n\n“Over the long term, the stock market news will be good,” Buffett wrote in an Op-Ed for the NY Times in 2008 (4).\n\n“In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.”",
