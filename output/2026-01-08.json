    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox have made some good moves this offseason, trading for Sonny Gray, Johan Oviedo and Willson Contreras. They’ve improved their rotation and upgraded at first base, especially defensively.\n\nWhat they haven’t done yet, however, is sign a Major League free agent two months into the offseason. After the Colorado Rockies signed veteran pitcher Michael Lorenzen to a one-year deal on Wednesday night, the Red Sox are now the only team that still hasn’t signed an MLB free agent this winter.\n\nGiven the team’s high payroll, goals and publicly expressed needs, that’s pretty shocking.\n\nIt’s not for a lack of trying. Boston made an offer to Pete Alonso before he signed with the Baltimore Orioles and has also made an “aggressive” offer to Alex Bregman. Time will tell if Bregman re-signs with the Red Sox, but there’s a good chance that he does.\n\nThe Red Sox are officially the only MLB club that has yet to sign a big-league free agent this offseason 😬 pic.twitter.com/c3ePQSL52Z\n\n— NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSBoston) January 8, 2026\n\nThose are big moves, however, and big moves don’t usually happen overnight. It’s more surprising that Boston hasn’t at least done a one-year deal for a reliever or depth player, who are much more plentiful and easier to sign.\n\nSpring Training is five weeks away, so there’s still time. Craig Breslow has a reputation for being patient and deliberate, and he hasn’t proven to be the kind of executive who recklessly throws money around. He has a plan, and he sticks to it.\n\nThe Red Sox have managed to make several good additions so far without spending any money in free agency. If they want someone like Bregman or Bo Bichette, however, that will have to change.\n\nYankees Predicted To Sign Former NL MVP While Red Sox Eye Different Free Agent",

    "fullText": "Well Mark Bowman wrote a good article on the status of the Braves’ search for starting pitching to add this offseason. It was interesting that he seemed to think that non-qualifying offer free agents or perhaps select non-top-tier trade options are the more likely avenues. Freddy Peralta is a hot commodity and has been covered a decent bit, but Jose Berrios is an off-the-beaten-path option that might be up Alex Anthopoulos’ alley and has an interesting profile. Berrios has struggled since joining Toronto, but was previously a reliable mid-rotation option in Minnesota. He has one year left on his contract at $19 million, with an opt-out before 2 years at $24 million each. That opt-out is surely something that Alex Anthopoulos would want to resolve somehow in a trade scenario before finalizing any deal. That said, Berrios would seem highly unlikely to require much trade capital to acquire, which might make him an appealing buy-low candidate at still only 31. Time will tell which route Anthopoulos chooses.\n\nMark Bowman wrote about Atlanta’s pursuit of a starting pitcher, throwing cold water on some of the top free agents, while promoting Chris Bassitt and Freddy Peralta as more likely options and Jose Berrios as a wild-card.\n\nThe Braves are once again experiencing some uncertainty regarding their TV deal. They could find themselves on a different channel or platform, or suffer loss of revenue.\n\nIvan took a look at what we should expect from Ozzie Albies this season, as he has been heavily diminished from his peak over the last two years.\n\nThe Rockies signed Michael Lorenzen to a one year $8 million deal, with a $9 million club option to be a starting pitcher for the club.\n\nThe Cubs traded top prospect Owen Caissie and two other prospects for Edward Cabrera from the Marlins, perhaps the most significant trade of the offseason as of yet.\n\nThe Yankees have made multiple offers for Cody Bellinger to return to the club, but the sides do not appear close to an agreement.",

    "fullText": "Josh Jacobs doesn’t hide how Packers felt about Jordan Love hit ahead of Bears rematch originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears don’t need much help turning a game into something emotional. History alone usually takes care of that. Add in playoff stakes, a division rivalry and a quarterback who didn’t make it out of the last meeting unscathed, and the temperature rises naturally.\n\nSaturday’s wild-card matchup has all the familiar ingredients. Green Bay and Chicago split their regular-season meetings, and the third installment comes with far more at stake than bragging rights. For the Bears, it’s a chance to make a statement at home. For the Packers, it’s about survival — and reminding a longtime rival that the road still runs through them.\n\nThose dynamics have lingered all week, but the tone sharpened once the conversation turned back to Week 16.\n\nThat’s when Packers quarterback Jordan Love took a hit in Chicago that resulted in a concussion and forced him to miss the following week’s loss to the Baltimore Ravens. While the Packers moved forward, the moment didn’t disappear inside the locker room.\n\nRunning back Josh Jacobs made that clear when speaking with reporters this week.\n\n“I know a lot of guys took that hit that he took a little personal,” Jacobs said, per The Athletic's Matt Schneidman. “So I’m not saying we gon’ go out there and play dirty or nothing like that, but we definitely gonna defend our brother.”\n\nJacobs stopped short of framing it as payback, and he was careful with his wording. But the message itself didn’t need translation. Green Bay hasn’t forgotten what happened, even as it insists discipline and control will matter most in a playoff setting.\n\nThat balance — emotion without recklessness — has defined much of the Packers’ season. Green Bay has lived on the edge at times, especially late, but it has also leaned on its leaders to keep things from spiraling. Jacobs has become one of those voices, both on the field and in the locker room.\n\nHis comments weren’t a promise of cheap shots or retaliation. They were a reminder that this is still a physical sport, and that quarterbacks don’t get left unprotected — especially in January.\n\nWhether the matchup turns chippy or simply physical remains to be seen. But Jacobs’ words made one thing clear: for the Packers, this isn’t just another playoff game. It’s personal — even if they insist it won’t cross the line.",

    "fullText": "Dillon Brooks returned to Memphis on Jan. 7 for his latest matchup against the Grizzlies, his former team.\n\nThis was his first time playing against them as a member of the Phoenix Suns, and he looked motivated. He led the team with 21 points in the 117-98 win at FedExForum.\n\nAfter the game, Brooks reflected on his time in Memphis, where he played from 2017 to 2023. The Grizzlies were the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference in each of his final two seasons, but they elected to move on from him.\n\nThey have yet to reach those heights again, and Brooks has an opinion on why that’s the case.\n\n“I just think they moved too fast,” he said. “Especially when I was there and Des (Bane) was there and (Steven Adams) was there. I think (the Grizzlies) moved too fast, trying to be (inventive) too fast and it kind of bit them in the butt a little bit.”\n\nThe Grizzlies parted ways with Brooks during the 2023 offseason. They missed the playoffs during an injury-riddled 2024 season, then were swept in the first round of the 2025 playoffs by the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nSince leaving Memphis, Brooks has made many notable comments. Among them was when he called out Grizzlies general manager Zach Kleiman for hurting his confidence during the 2023 playoffs.\n\nIn 2023, Brooks also talked about how he didn’t have plays run for him to help find a rhythm. After the Suns' win, he said he still doesn’t get plays run for him, but he has worked on his game, and he credited the belief the Suns' coaches, players and organization have put in him.\n\n“You got to be willing to have communication, have trust in the players, and they play hard for you,” Brooks said. “I think that’s not what I see over there (in Memphis) now.”\n\nDamichael Cole is the Memphis Grizzlies beat writer for The Commercial Appeal.

    "fullText": "Tyler Herro gets honest about the 'young and fun' Miami Heat this season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a long while with many veterans on the team, the Miami Heat have embraced a younger squad this season. Head coach Erik Spoelstra has implemented a run-and-gun system this season, which has been quite helpful to players like Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Pelle Larsson.\n\nTyler Herro and Bam Adebayo were once the youngsters of the Heat roster, but now, they are considered the veterans. They are excited about playing for the Heat as the reliable veterans and leaders of this mostly young squad.\n\nThe current Heat rotation is filled to the brim with talented youngsters. Names like Jaquez, Larsson, and Nikola Jovic are some of the most promising players on the roster. They fit Spoelstra's new vision of working hard and playing hard at a fast pace.\n\nFor Herro and Adebayo, this can be jarring, especially since they played in a Jimmy Butler-centric system. Now that Butler is with the Golden State Warriors, Spoelstra and his system have become much more fast-paced.\n\nMore: Heat's Tyler Herro made NBA 3-point history 1 game faster than Steph Curry\n\nHerro is glad and happy to play in this current iteration of the Heat. It has been a rough season for him because he missed plenty of games with an injury. Now that he has returned, the team is ecstatic about his comeback, while he is playing with more youthful players.\n\n\"This team, we're young and fun. We got energy, being on the sideline, that’s one thing I noticed since this season started. I've seen the game through a different lens than on the court. Everyone is coachable and understanding of each other so far. It’s like everyone is for each other this year; that goes a long way,\" Herro said in response to a question about the current roster.\n\nMoving forward, the Heat have a promising future with the current squad. It will be a challenging stretch, but in the long run, they could keep developing into a better team. With a good mix of experience and youth, Spoelstra has a strong team that could be even better in the long-term future.\n\nErik Spoelstra expresses disappointment in the Miami Heat's lack of effort\n\nBam Adebayo ties second all-time for field goals made in Heat history\n\nNorman Powell continues his All-Star campaign this season 'Hopefully it happens for me'\n\nMiami's top defender Davion Mitchell seen as a huge threat to Anthony Edwards\n\nNBA trade rumors: Ranking 9 most likely stars to be traded, from Giannis Antetokounmpo to Anthony Davis",

    "fullText": "CJ McCollum reacts to being traded to Atlanta Hawks for Trae Young originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCJ McCollum’s brief tenure with the Washington Wizards has come to an end.\n\nThe veteran guard was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, along with Corey Kispert, for star guard Trae Young. The Hawks will be McCollum’s fourth team in the league following stints with the Portland Trail Blazers, New Orleans Pelicans and Wizards.\n\nMcCollum was traded from New Orleans to Washington during the 2025 NBA Draft. In all, he appeared in 35 games for Washington and posted averages of 18.8 points, 3.6 assists and 3.5 rebounds in 30.9 minutes per performance.\n\nAfter news of the trade broke, McCollum, 34, reacted to the deal by expressing gratitude for his time in D.C. and excitement about his future in Atlanta.\n\n“Loved my time in DC,” McCollum said, via NBA insider Chris Haynes. “Organization was great to my family and I. Michael Winger and Will [Dawkins] did everything they said they would and kept their word from the very beginning. Love the city and they’re doing things the right way over there.\n\n\"Exited to get to The A and get to work. Very familiar with their style of play. Love the ownership group and front office. Good group of players.”\n\nIt certainly doesn’t sound like McCollum harbors any ill will towards the Wizards organization for trading him, but if he does, he won’t have to wait too long to exact some revenge. The Hawks will host the Wizards for back-to-back games on Feb. 24 and 26.\n\nUltimately, McCollum's stay in Atlanta, like his stay in Washington, could be a short one. He's headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and there's no guarantee that he'll be back in Atlanta. But, if he proves to be a valuable addition to the Hawks this season, he'll boost his own stock in the process.",

(AP) — Brayden Burries scored 28 points, Motiejus Krivas added a career-high 25 and No. 1 Arizona remained unbeaten with a 101-76 win over Kansas State on Wednesday night.\n\nArizona (15-0, 2-0 Big 12) is off to its best start since winning the first 21 games of the 2013-14 season. Arizona won by at least 18 points for the 10th consecutive game, matching a mark Michigan had earlier this season that tied for the longest such run since 2003-04.\n\nBurries had his fifth 20-point game and matched his career high by going 12 for 16 from the field while adding nine rebounds. Krivas was 7 of 10, making 11 of 13 free throws, and had 12 rebounds.\n\nKoa Peat had 15 points and 10 rebounds and Tobe Awaka added nine and 11 as Arizona outrebounded Kansas State 55-32. Arizona shot 49.3% from the field but was just 3 of 16 from 3-point range.\n\nKansas State (9-6, 0-2) went 8 for 36 from deep and shot 33.8% overall. PJ Haggerty led the way with 19 points on 8-of-20 shooting, while Nate Johnson added 15 and Dorin Buca 12.\n\nWACO, Texas (AP) — Joshua Jefferson had 19 points and 17 rebounds as Iowa State won its 15th consecutive game to start the season, over Baylor.\n\nTamin Lipsey scored 24 points on 8-of-12 shooting after early foul trouble, and Killyan Toure had 12 for the Cyclones (15-0, 2-0 Big 12). They didn’t lead until Jefferson’s 3-pointer on their final shot before halftime, and stayed ahead after a 14-1 run to begin the second half when six players scored and Jefferson capped it with a fast-break dunk.\n\nIowa State’s 15-0 start and 15-game winning streak are both school records, surpassing the 14-0 start by the 2013-14 team that reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nCameron Carr had 17 points to lead Baylor (10-4, 0-2). James Nnaji, the 2023 NBA draft pick who just joined the Bears, got a much different reaction in his home debut when scoring two points with five rebounds in 16 minutes. He was booed when he entered Saturday’s game at TCU and every time he touched the ball after that.\n\nNO. 4 UCONN 103, PROVIDENCE 98, OT\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Braylon Mullins scored eight of his career-high 24 points in overtime and UConn rallied past Providence for its 11th consecutive victory.\n\nSilas Demary Jr. had 23 points, 15 assists and five steals for the Huskies (15-1, 5-0 Big East), who trailed by 11 with under three minutes remaining in regulation. But they went on a 9-0 run and then tied it at 89 on a putback by Tarris Reed Jr. with 13 seconds left.\n\nAlex Karaban also scored 23 for UConn, which shot 18 of 32 from 3-point range (56%).\n\nMullins, a freshman guard, scored the first five Huskies points in overtime before his sixth 3-pointer made it a two-possession game with less than two minutes to play. Reed, who had 20 points and eight rebounds, and Demary added baskets in the final minute to help Connecticut hang on despite getting outscored 41-3 in bench points.\n\nReserve guard Ryan Mela paced the Friars (8-7, 1-3) with 19 points and Jamier Jones added 18. Providence led 47-37 at halftime and finished the game shooting 50% from the field — including 14 for 24 (58%) on 3s.\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Braden Smith finished with 23 points and seven assists and made two late free throws to help Purdue fend off Washington’s late rally.\n\nTrey Kaufman-Renn added 14 points and 14 rebounds as the Boilermakers won their fifth in a row and matched a school-best start at 14-1 (4-0 Big Ten) for the ninth time in program history.\n\nIt came on a night Purdue honored Smith, an Associated Press preseason All-American guard, before the national anthem by presenting the Big Ten’s new career assists leader with a framed poster. Smith broke the record Friday at Wisconsin and pushed his career total to 900 on Wednesday.\n\nYet, it was an odd night for Smith, who went 10 of 15 from the field with only one 3-pointer while committing six turnovers and spending nearly 8 1/2 consecutive minutes on the bench after drawing his third foul with 4:20 left in the first half.\n\nHannes Steinbach had 17 points to lead the Huskies (9-6, 1-3). Quimari Peterson had 15 and Zoom Diallo added 14 points. Franck Kepnang had 10 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out with 9:14 to play.\n\nPROVO, Utah (AP) — Richie Saunders scored a career-high 31 points and grabbed eight rebounds to lead BYU to a victory over Arizona State.\n\nSaunders, who averaged 28 points in two wins over the Sun Devils last season, went 10 of 13 from the field and made six 3-pointers. AJ Dybantsa added 23 points, seven boards and five assists to help the Cougars (14-1, 2-0 Big 12) win their 11th straight game. Robert Wright III had 27 points.\n\nBYU outscored Arizona State 31-16 in fast-break points and blocked 10 shots.\n\nAnthony Johnson scored 24 points while Massamba Diop had 22 points and nine rebounds to pace the Sun Devils (9-6, 0-2), who dropped their fourth game in a row.\n\nNO. 11 VANDERBILT 96, NO. 13 ALAMBAMA 90\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tyler Tanner scored a career-high 29 points and Vanderbilt remained undefeated by beating Alabama.\n\nThe Commodores (15-0, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) extended their best start since winning 16 straight games to open the 2007-08 season. This is only the second time in the program’s 124-year history that Vanderbilt has won its first 15.\n\nVanderbilt hadn’t played a ranked opponent until this game, also the first here between two top-15 teams since Jan. 5, 1974. Then-No. 10 Vanderbilt beat the 14th-ranked Crimson Tide in that game on its way to splitting the SEC championship with Alabama.\n\nVanderbilt also beat Alabama for the first time at Memorial Gym since 2018, ending a five-game skid against the Tide.\n\nDuke Miles finished with 19 points before fouling out, and four other Commodores had four fouls apiece. Tyler Nickel scored 12 points. Devin McGlockton and AK Okereke, who also fouled out, each added 10.\n\nAlabama (11-4, 1-1) had its four-game winning streak snapped in a game featuring 63 combined fouls, with two technicals on the Crimson Tide.\n\nAmari Allen led Alabama with a season-high 25 points. Leading scorer Labaron Philon Jr. added 18 but checked out with 16:06 to go and never returned. Aden Holloway had 22 points and Latrell Wrightsell Jr. scored 13.\n\nNO. 15 ARKANSAS 94, MISSISSIPPI 87\n\nOXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Darius Acuff, Jr. had 26 points and nine assists, and Arkansas got double-figure scoring from five players in a win over Mississippi.\n\nArkansas (12-3, 2-0 SEC) used a decisive 14-6 run midway through the second half to build an insurmountable 76-61 lead. The win snapped a three-game losing streak to Ole Miss (8-7, 0-2).\n\nThe Rebels pulled within 91-87 in the final minute, but Acuff converted a short jumper and Trevon Brazile added a free throw to help seal the win. Arkansas finished 22 of 30 (73%) from the free throw line, including 11 of 12 by Acuff.\n\nBrazile scored 18 points, Billy Richmond III and Meleek Thomas added 13 points apiece, and Karter Knox scored 10 in the balanced Arkansas performance.\n\nOle Miss was led by Ilias Kamardine and Malik Dia with 16 points apiece. AJ Storr scored 12 points, Eduardo Klafke had 11 in the second half and Patton Pinkins added 10.\n\nNO. 23 VIRGINIA 84, CALIFORNIA 60\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Malik Thomas scored 20 points and Virginia beat California in its Atlantic Coast Conference home openert, scoring at least 80 points for the 14th time in 15 games this season.\n\nJohann Grunloh, Thijs De Ridder, Sam Lewis and Ugonna Onyenso each added 12 for the Cavaliers (13-2, 2-1), who assisted on 23 of 30 baskets and dominated the glass with 45-26 edge in rebounding.\n\nVirginia has won two straight since a triple-overtime loss at rival Virginia Tech on New Year’s Eve.\n\nFormer Virginia guard Dai Dai Ames, who transferred to Cal after last year and is the team’s leading scorer this season, had 18 points for the Golden Bears (13-3, 1-2).\n\nJustin Pippen, son of NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen, added 17 points and Virginia Tech transfer John Camden finished with 15.\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) — RJ Godfrey scored 17 points and Clemson held down SMU.\n\nThe Tigers (13-3) have started 3-0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference for a second consecutive season. And they did it by corralling one of the highest-scoring teams in the country most of the way.\n\nSMU (12-3, 1-1) came in averaging 91.5 points per game — tops in the ACC and 14th nationally — but couldn’t crack Clemson’s defense until late in the game.\n\nThe Mustangs cut a 15-point deficit to 71-67 on Boopie Miller’s free throws with 1:23 left. SMU had a chance to get closer, but Miller missed a short jumper. Jake Wahlin got the rebound for Clemson and made a foul shot with 22.5 seconds to play.\n\nMoments later, Dillon Hunter hit two foul shots to extend the lead to 74-67 with less than 10 seconds remaining.\n\nMiller led all scorers with 23 points. Samet Yigitoglu had 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Mustangs.",

    "description": "Who will be the Commanders' next defensive coordinator? We look at 10 potential options.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders are coming off a hugely disappointing 5-12 season, one season after a shocking 12-5 year and a run to the NFC Championship Game. In response to such a disastrous season, head coach Dan Quinn is making changes — big changes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Quinn and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury mutually agreed to part ways. Judging by Quinn's inability to endorse Kingsbury over the last two weeks, it wasn't shocking despite the good work Kingsbury has done with the Commanders' offense, even despite the injuries. Right after the Kingsbury news, the Commanders also fired defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. and offensive line coach Bobby Johnson.\n\nQuinn took over as defensive play-caller before Washington's Week 11 game against Miami. It doesn't sound like that will continue, as Quinn wants to focus on being the head coach. So, who could replace Whitt as defensive coordinator?\n\nWe named 10 potential candidates to be the Commanders' next offensive coordinator. Now, here are 10 defensive coordinator candidates.\n\nEmbedded content: https://commanderswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/commanders/2026/01/06/washington-commanders-10-names-watch-kingsbury-oc/88056493007/\n\nJeff Ulbrich may be the leader in the clubhouse. He's still under contract with the Falcons, but that could change soon. Ulbrich and Quinn go back to when Quinn was a 49ers assistant, and Ulbrich was a linebacker. Ulbrich began his coaching career with the Seahawks when Quinn was an assistant there. He would serve under Quinn during his entire six seasons with the Falcons. From there, he went to the Jets, where he served as a successful defensive coordinator for 4 years. Keep an eye on this one.\n\nMorris and Dan Quinn are close. They've known one another for over 20 years, dating back to when Quinn was a young assistant at Hofstra when Morris played there. When Quinn was the Falcons' head coach, Morris was on his staff for 6 seasons. Morris has been a successful defensive coordinator with the Rams and a two-time head coach. It sounds like he will first focus on head-coaching interviews before considering any defensive coordinator positions.\n\nAnother potential favorite. Harris once said he'd follow Dan Quinn anywhere while they were both with the Cowboys. He tried to bring him to Washington, but the Cowboys blocked it. Harris landed with the Bears this season, and they turn the ball over better than anyone in the NFL. Chicago doesn't have the best defense, but they are ballhawks. Harris has been an integral part of that success, much like he was in Dallas under Quinn. The Cowboys forced turnovers better than anyone during Quinn and Harris's tenure from 2021-23. Does Quinn want to go with another first-time play-caller? That's the biggest question here. Otherwise, Harris would be a phenomenal hire.\n\nA veteran coach who has been a successful defensive coordinator with four different teams and a former head coach. He and Quinn come from the same Pete Carroll coaching tree. Quinn worked on the Seattle staff with Bradley for two years. This hire would not energize fans. Bradley's defenses with the Colts tailed off. Many would consider this an uninspiring hire at this point.\n\nJonathan Gannon is now free. He will land somewhere and quickly. He was terrific as the Eagles' defensive coordinator for two seasons. Gannon is a creative coach. He has no ties to Quinn and would bring fresh ideas to a staff in dire need of them. Gannon will be at the top of a few lists this offseason.\n\nA pipedream. Flores is a coaching free agent. He can go anywhere. However, he plans to interview for head coaching positions but could return to Minnesota if he doesn't land one. It would be hard for Washington to land Flores. Flores could essentially pick anywhere he wants to go. There are rumors that he could land in Las Vegas as head coach. We shall see. However, Kevin O'Connell will fight to keep him. Flores is the NFL's best defensive coordinator. One of the league's best defensive schemers.\n\nAlong with Flores, this is a dream candidate. The Browns won five games because of Schwartz's defense. A Maryland native and Georgetown University graduate, he once interviewed for Washington's head coaching position. A former Lions head coach, Schwartz has built top defenses across the NFL. The Browns are interviewing him for the head coaching vacancy. Another coach with no ties to Quinn, so don't look for this one to happen either.\n\nThe former NFL linebacker has also enjoyed a successful coaching career. He has worked with Quinn before and has been the Commanders LB coach since 2024. A two-time defensive coordinator with the Seahawks and Raiders, Norton is a long shot. But he has experience calling plays, so you can't rule him out.\n\nThe first name on the list. The Commanders asked the Raiders for permission to interview Graham on Wednesday. A Yale graduate, Graham has been the Raiders' defensive coordinator since 2022, surviving multiple head coaches. Before that, he was the Giants' defensive coordinator. Graham hasn't always had a lot to work with, so he's creative and loves to blitz. You want a guy who has done more with less? Graham qualifies.\n\nCory Undlin is the underdog. He's been an NFL assistant for 22 years and had only one stint as a defensive coordinator: with the Detroit Lions in 2020. That team was terrible, and Undlin didn't have a real shot. From there, he went to San Francisco, worked under Kyle Shanahan for two years before following DeMeco Ryans to Houston. The Texans have one of the NFL's top defenses, and Undlin is very involved. He deserves another shot. GM Adam Peters was in San Francisco for both of Undlin's years there, so there is familiarity.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: 10 potential defensive coordinator candidates",

    "fullText": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander rescued the Oklahoma City Thunder with a game-tying buzzer-beater before finishing with 46 points in a 129-125 overtime victory against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.\n\nThe reigning NBA champions looked to be heading for a third straight loss after the Jazz inched into a 114-112 lead following Lauri Markkanen's layup with just three seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut NBA Most Valuable Player Gilgeous-Alexander drained a superb 13-foot jump shot to tie it up at 114-114 as the buzzer sounded to send the game into overtime.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander then took over in the extra period with nine points as the Western Conference leaders returned to winning ways after back-to-back defeats.\n\n\"We just tried to stay in the moment and do whatever it took to get the W,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said afterwards.\n\n\"It's not always going to be pretty, but we've got to play a lot better... we'd rather learn lessons in a win than in a loss.\"\n\nAsked about his game-tying buzzer-beater, Gilgeous-Alexander added: \"That's what I practice for.

    "fullText": "The post-Ruben Amorim era showed flashes of promise, but eventually, Manchester United had to be satisfied with only a point from their Premier League encounter against Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nUnder the lights at Turf Moor, it was the home side who took the lead through a lucky deflection, against the run of play.\n\nThe visitors should have scored twice before half-time, but Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha were denied by goalline clearances.\n\nBut then, in the second half, it was the Benjamin Sesko show, as the Slovenian scored twice in 10 minutes to hand the Red Devils the lead.\n\nThe Clarets ended up equalising, but fans were pleased to finally see the Slovenia international return to scoring ways after a difficult last few weeks.\n\nDuring the post-match interaction with BBC, the ex-RB Leipzig striker stated as much, while revealing his delight to end his drought in front of goal.\n\n“It helps me for my confidence,” the striker said. “It’s been tough, but now I finally did it and I’m happy I could help the team.\n\n“This is the most important for me and now it’s just up to me and up to us to keep going like that.”\n\nThere were improvements, both individually, as seen from Sesko and Dorgu’s performance, and as a team, especially from an attacking perspective.\n\nIt was helped by interim boss Darren Fletcher’s brave substitutions. And the United striker told Sky Sports that it is now up to the team to continue this positive momentum moving forward.\n\n“Now it’s up to us. Obviously, to stand together as a group, to really show we can work together no matter what situation.\n\n“In the end, it’s just important for us to focus on the upcoming games, upcoming trainings. That’s the most important.”\n\nUnited will seen next in action in the FA Cup, with a home tie against Brighton on Sunday. Fletcher is expected to remain in charge for the game.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby underwent what he termed successful left knee surgery Wednesday.\n\nCrosby posted a photo of himself on X flexing his arms while lying in a hospital bed. He had a brace on his knee.\n\n“Expecting 200% recovery,” Crosby wrote. “Year 8 Will Be The Greatest Year Yet.”\n\nCrosby didn't say where the surgery took place, but he said on the “Let's Go” podcast with Jim Gray that he was planning to fly to Los Angeles on Monday to meet with orthopedic surgeon Dr. Neal ElAttrache.\n\nCrosby hurt his knee at mid-season and played through the injury, but was placed on injured reserve with two games left. Crosby left the Raiders' facility upset after that decision, but returned the following week.\n\nHe had 10 sacks and a career-high 28 tackles for loss this season. Crosby has double-digit sacks three of the past four seasons.\n\nCrosby signed a three-year extension worth $106.5 million, with $91.5 million guaranteed, on March 5 that briefly made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. The deal takes Crosby through the 2029 season.\n\nRaiders general manager John Spytek was asked this week about Crosby's future with the organization.\n\n“I’ve had the opportunity in the last several weeks to spend a lot of time with Maxx, and I think it’s been well documented that he didn’t love the idea of not playing football,” Spytek said. “I think you always want that from your best players. In fact, I think that’s why they’re your best players. So, I love Maxx. He embodies what a Raider is.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "The Chicago Blackhawks defeated the St. Louis Blues, their fourth straight win.",
    "fullText": "CHICAGO - The Chicago Blackhawks came into Wednesday night's matchup winners of three straight games. They were looking to make it four with the St. Louis Blues in town.\n\nWith Connor Bedard and Frank Nazar out of the lineup, the Hawks needed the rest of their forwards to continue stepping up in their place. They have been doing just that since the holiday break ended, which has gotten them right back in the Western Conference race.\n\nThings started poorly for Chicago, as they allowed a goal to Tyler Tucker of the Blues less than one minute into the game. It's not easy to play well from behind that early, but they found a way.\n\nWhile on the man-advantage with the second unit out there, Nick Lardis blasted a beautiful pass from Oliver Moore past Jordan Binnington to tie the game at 1. That would be the end of the scoring for either team in the first period.\n\nIn the second, things took a dramatic turn in favor of Chicago. Oliver Moore and Otto Stenberg exchanged goals less than one minute apart for the 2-2 tie, but the Blackhawks took over from there.\n\nBefore the middle frame was over, the Blackhawks were winning 5-2 thanks to three consecutive goals by Connor Murphy, Landon Slaggert, and Jason Dickinson.\n\nThe Blackhawks kept their momentum going in the third period. Andre Burakovsky made it 6-2 with a snipe while the Blackhawks were working with a 5-on-3 advantage. That made them 3 for 3 on the power play for the evening.\n\nThe Blackhawks were not done there. Louis Crevier scored by cleaning up a rebound to make it 7-2. Less than one minute later, however, the Blues got one back in the form of Nathan Walker.\n\nThat 7-3 score stood as the final. It was once again a strange game between these two franchises. Every game this year has been so far, one way or another.\n\nSpencer Knight played extremely well for the Blackhawks in goal. He allowed three goals by the end of the game, but he made some point-blank saves on high-danger Blues chances while the game was still up for grabs.\n\nanother goal for the kid✅ pic.twitter.com/95L64uf9Bl\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\nmore goals 🔜😏 pic.twitter.com/MHHAks0n5L\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\nMurph's first of the season!👏👇 pic.twitter.com/KJGdwOCmiP\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\nadmin stands corrected, Landon Slaggert tipped in this goal!👏 https://t.co/jGotVsXB3F pic.twitter.com/4IUhAGKr8K\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\ncould we add Chelsea Dagger to the queue one more time pls🎶 pic.twitter.com/ebGyERyT6g\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\nAndre Burakovsky on the power play🔥 pic.twitter.com/gDzTmNBLko\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\ntouchdown + the extra point🙌 pic.twitter.com/WsIrhwrxDB\n\n— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) January 8, 2026\n\nWhat’s Next For The Blackhawks?\n\nThe Blackhawks are back in action on Friday night at the United Center.

    "fullText": "A few weeks into the season, Everton’s chief marketing and digital officer, Aaron Duckmanton, received an email from a colleague with links to YouTube and TikTok accounts called ‘Japarton /ジャパートン’. Defenders Rion Ishikawa and Hikaru Kitagawa, and midfielders Yūka Momiki and Honoka Hayashi were racking up tens of thousands of views posting Q&A videos in Japanese and vlogging their days at the club.\n\n“We’ve got four young Japanese football players who are living together in the city of Liverpool and just having a great time,” Duckmanton tells The Athletic. “Let’s embrace this and see where it goes.”\n\nA few weeks ago, Everton’s training ground chefs served traditional Japanese food, with the subsequent taste test posted across Everton’s own channels. “On those platforms that we know the Japanese market are looking at, on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, we’ve featured those players quite heavily,” says Duckmanton.\n\n“We’ve got this perfect storm of wanting to increase the visibility of Everton Women, the league’s continued expansion internationally and players who’ve really bought into that, and are at the heart of what social media is because they’ve grown up with it. By them creating their own content and their own channels, the club has seen a massive uplift.”\n\nWhile fans from Liverpool and Greater Manchester still dominate ticket sales for Everton Women, international growth opens up new revenue streams. The women’s team pages on Everton’s website have enjoyed a 33 per cent increase in traffic from Japan, according to Duckmanton.\n\n“The impact that these players are having, plus the growth of the Women’s Super League (WSL), is translating back to direct interest in Everton Football Club,” Duckmanton says. “We’re really starting to see our Japanese fans come through and start to become an active member of our community.”\n\nHe outlines the trajectory: fans to purchasers, purchasers to subscribers to Everton TV, and on and on. The goal is that “in a year’s time, two years’ time, they’ll be die-hard Evertonians. But they’re not from Liverpool. That’s the beauty of international fandom.”\n\nThe trend isn’t limited to Everton.\n\nWhen the WSL moved its non-broadcast games to YouTube ahead of the 2024-25 season, it found a large audience in Japan.\n\nThe country accounted for 21 per cent of the audience for Everton’s opening game against Brighton & Hove Albion that season; the UK audience was 40 per cent. Japan also made up 27 per cent of the audience for Manchester City versus West Ham in October 2024, compared to the UK audience of 28 per cent, according to YouTube.\n\nWith the help of global sports marketing agency IMG to extend rights distribution abroad, 13 international broadcasters are showing WSL matches during the 2025-26 season. Though the availability of matches on YouTube depended on the terms of those existing broadcast deals in different countries, there was still an encouraging pattern in Japan.\n\nSeventy-six per cent of the WSL’s broadcast audience last season came from outside of the UK, according to figures supplied by the WSL, but Japan is a particular hotbed of potential. Outside of the UK, Japan is second only to the U.S. in terms of WSL fanbase size, according to the latest YouGov report on the WSL’s international appeal.\n\nThe formula for success is a mix of availability and representation.\n\nThe visibility helps attract talent. The WSL sent more players to the 2023 World Cup than any other league, and opens up hitherto unexplored commercial markets.\n\nIn the 2023-24 season, for example, Japan midfielder Fuka Nagano was the most-requested name on Liverpool Women shirts after their homegrown midfielder Missy Bo Kearns. Discussions with brands and sponsors can take on a global tilt.\n\nThe YouTube data led directly to the sale of WSL rights to Japanese streaming service U-Next, via a partnership with sports marketing agency Pitch International. “They took that YouTube data to start a conversation,” said Zarah Al-Kudcy, the chief revenue officer at WSL Football. “We were able to demonstrate the audience that they will inherit.\n\n“The feedback came that (Japan is) very athlete-centric in how they present a lot of their rights. They also carry the Premier League, and they liked that we had 12 (Japanese) players in our league.”\n\nThe WSL also has another virtual behemoth to credit for its sustained international growth: EA Sports FC, previously the FIFA video games series.\n\n“The EA data shows that the younger generations are finding (the WSL) and educating themselves through the game,” continues Al-Kudcy, who previously worked in marketing and sponsorship roles at Sky and Formula One, and on organising committees for rugby union and cricket World Cups.\n\nThe biggest driver has been the game’s Ultimate Team feature, which allows players to build a dream squad comprising male and female players from around the world. Al-Kudcy recalls attending the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, and seeing posters for Chelsea forward Sam Kerr promoting what was then FIFA 23.\n\n“The ability of EA to cut through internationally is huge,” she adds. “I think that’s what’s changing the fandom. They tend to be more educated because they’ve learned stuff through the game.”\n\nThe research, she says, indicates that those gamers are substantially more likely to engage with the league — buying merchandise and subscriptions and following on social media — than football fans who don’t play the game.\n\nWhile growth at clubs like Arsenal and Manchester United has been spearheaded by the most visible Lionesses, teams without an England international must look to other ways to market their talent.\n\nJapan was the eighth most-represented country in the WSL in the second half of last season, and there were 19 players in the league in the first half of the 24-25 campaign. In addition to Everton’s quartet, Hinata Miyazawa, the golden boot winner at the 2023 World Cup, recently re-signed with Manchester United; Manchester City’s reigning player of the year is Japan midfielder Yui Hasegawa.\n\nThere is precedent in the men’s game for this: Tim Cahill, Tim Howard and Landon Donovan saw Everton fans spring up in Australia and the U.S.. “When we signed James Rodriguez, our Colombian fanbase overnight grew by 4,000 per cent,” Duckmanton continues.\n\n“We know the power that comes with players. The challenge is retaining them: how do we build something so authentic in that region (that) furthers the journey into being a fully-fledged Evertonian — that makes them see past the individual players that we have — even when those players are no longer playing for the football club?”\n\nThe WSL has the advantage of effectively being the sister to the Premier League, whose own figures have it broadcast to 189 countries and 900 million homes across the world.\n\nThe Premier League’s Summer Series in the U.S. is indicative of its growing focus on the international market and, increasingly, WSL clubs are committing to their own overseas tours. In August last year, Crystal Palace Women played their first overseas match, against Utah Royals, while Manchester City Women toured Australia in 2024 and Arsenal Women and Chelsea played matches in the U.S. last summer.\n\nThe Premier League’s global influence is “what has set them apart from a lot of the other men’s leagues,” says Al-Kudcy, and the aim is for the WSL to “achieve similar growth — and I don’t necessarily mean in numbers, but in understanding the principles that they’ve looked at in building their brand globally.” A strength of Premier League clubs, she continues, is “knowing their target markets”.\n\n“It’s not a surprise that for Arsenal Women, Australia is massive, given the number of Matildas (in the squad),” she adds. “So how do we work with them on building that momentum in Australia?” Major tournaments or new signings crossing with the WSL’s significant markets is especially advantageous.\n\nMost clubs are now global brands: Chelsea and Liverpool are the second and third-most supported WSL teams in Japan, according to the latest YouGov report (commissioned by the WSL) on the league’s global appeal.\n\n“In Japanese football history, almost no one has played (at clubs) such as Manchester City, United or Chelsea, like, big clubs, before,” says Momiki, who made her WSL debut at Leicester City in January 2024 before moving to Everton this summer. “I think most Japanese fans are really excited about this. In (the) WSL, the level is (of) one of the top leagues in the world right now.”\n\nManchester City Women are the most popular WSL club in Japan, which Nils Nielsen, the Greenlandic-Danish manager of the Japan women’s national team who also served as Manchester City Women’s director of football during the 23-24 season, attributes in part to their connection to Yokohama F. Marinos, also part of the City Football Group. City’s men’s team toured Japan in 2023, playing against Yokohama, and its trophy tour included stops in Japan this year. That kind of engagement is more significant than the Premier League histories of the clubs, he says.\n\n“I think that (the WSL) is more interesting to watch because there are so many Japanese players,” Nielsen says. “It’s not necessarily because the WSL is more interesting than everything else, but it becomes interesting when you have almost the entire national team based in England.”\n\nIn England, the most high-profile Lionesses have attained mainstream fame. At times, it feels like the health of the WSL rests on the continued growth of their profiles. Those same stars do not dominate the conversation around the WSL in Japan, Nielsen says.\n\nFans are likely to know of the players “that everyone knows” — they will know of Chloe Kelly’s penalty technique, for instance — but little of those players’ histories or positions. “Fans of anybody other than the Japanese — I doubt there are too many of those,” he says. “They do follow it, but it’s mostly because of the Japanese girls, not because they have any connection with the teams and such.”\n\nJapanese players command significant commercial power in their own country: Hasegawa can be seen on billboards in Tokyo.\n\n“It’s a different world for them now than it was before,” Nielsen says. “It gives them so many more options, and it doesn’t really matter if they’re based in Japan. When it comes to the financial part, it’s an advantage to be based abroad because the audience is bigger and they will be more visible.\n\n“It is not as big as in some of the English-speaking countries — as it is in Australia and New Zealand — but after how it was five or 10 years ago, this is massive. The players are much more well-known now than when they were world champions. Now, it’s more accessible and it is more normal for the Japanese to look outside of the country.”\n\nThat broader outlook also applies to Japanese players, who, Nielsen says, are now more open to the prospect of playing in England than ever; there is less anxiety over the language barrier, and improved job security and money. Before the 2023-24 season, only eight Japanese players had featured in the WSL in its 12-year history.\n\nThe drawback for Japan’s WE League is a talent drain. Japanese players make their debuts domestically before moving abroad.\n\n“(In) my second year in Sweden (playing for Linkoping), I’d already decided that my next step is definitely England,” says Everton’s Momiki. “I asked the agent to contact only English teams. I need to get better on my physical aspect, not only my intelligence or skills. So coming to England is really challenging myself. I think the other Japanese player(s) think the same way.\n\n“Sometimes, I’ve found Japanese fans in the stadium. I think they’re coming to the Japanese players’ clubs. I think Japanese people don’t watch Arsenal versus Crystal Palace, because there’s no Japanese players. But Leicester against West Ham or against Manchester City, I think many Japanese people are coming to watch now.”\n\nThe WSL is a global women’s football league. Now, it has to consolidate that status.\n\n“We have to be more than just the audience that comes to the matchday,” concludes Al-Kudcy. “We do have to think about our global fan group as well.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nEverton, Soccer, Sports Business, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "WACO, Texas (AP) — Iowa State point guard Tamin Lipsey, the senior who grew up near campus in Ames, is now part of something that had never been done by the Cyclones. They have a 15-game winning streak to start the season.\n\n“I’ve been a Cyclone all my life. Just got on the court four years ago, though,” Lipsey said Wednesday night following a 70-60 victory at Baylor. “Watching all those teams growing up and just realizing that I have a chance right now to make a footprint for Iowa State, and just the community of Ames and all of that, I never take for granted.”\n\nLipsey scored 24 points, overcoming some early foul trouble that kept him on the bench for nearly eight minutes in the first half. Joshua Jefferson had 19 points and 17 rebounds for Iowa State (15-0, 2-0 Big 12).\n\nThe Cyclones' 15-0 start and 15-game winning streak are both school records, surpassing a 14-0 start by the 2013-14 team that reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. They are one of six undefeated Division I teams, along with No. 1 Arizona, No. 2 Michigan, No. 10 Nebraska, No. 11 Vanderbilt and unranked Miami, Ohio.\n\n“I think these guys do such a great job at honoring all those who have come before us with the effort and the execution that they play with,” fifth-year Cyclones coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “So it’s a great accomplishment. It’s a credit to the young men and how they work. And hopefully something that the past Cyclones who have been in this program and those that have invested can take tremendous pride in.”\n\nJefferson, a senior forward and second-year transfer from Saint Mary's, already had his sixth double-double of the season by halftime.\n\nHis long-3-pointer with 5 seconds left in the first half gave the Cyclones their first lead at 25-24. They never gave that up, starting the second half with a 14-1 run when six players scored and Jefferson capped it with a fast-break dunk.\n\n“A huge shot Joshua made just before the half,\" Otzelberger said. “A huge momentum play that carried into that second half.”\n\nLipsey has started all 115 of his games in four seasons with the Cyclones, including three NCAA Tournament appearances and a Sweet 16 in that time. He came out after his second foul with 17:12 left in the first half and didn't return until the 9:19 mark. He finally scored with 6:11 left in the first half, then had 20 points after halftime.\n\n\"I'd take him over any point guard in America,\" Otzelberger said. “Obviously, not having Tamin out there quite as much in the first half impacted where the game was at. But man, in that second half, the plays he made, the shots he made, it was amazing — especially when you have to bounce back when your normal routine and rhythm of a game is disrupted because of the fouls.”\n\nAfter the Cyclones shot 27.8% from the field (10 of 36) in the first half, they were at 57.1% (16 of 28) after halftime.\n\nOn the defensive side, they held Baylor to 18.8% (6 of 32) before halftime and 30.6% (19 of 62) overall.\n\n“Iowa State is a really good team. If you ask me, right now, today, them and Michigan are the two best in college basketball,” Baylor coach Scott Drew said. “They’re not going to beat themselves. They know exactly where they’re going to be, how they’re going to do things. T.J. has done a great job with them.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "It was fun while it lasted",
    "fullText": "Interim head coach Calum McFarlane was hoping to build on Sunday’s rousing 1-1 draw at the Etihad and hand the team off to new full-time head coach Liam Rosenior (who was in attendance last night) with good momentum, but yet another red card consigned the Blues to yet another poor result, losing 2-1 at Craven Cottage. It was Chelsea’s league-leading fifth (5th!) red card of the season. Everton are the only other team to have more than two, after they had two players sent off late on yesterday.\n\nWith Chelsea also high up on the yellow cards list (fourth most in the league), the team’s discipline (or lack thereof) has been drawn into sharp focus of late. This is a rather familiar concern with this (still) young team, though for McFarlane, Marc Cucurella’s red card was more of a footballing incident than one stemming from poor discipline. (The multitude of yellows that followed were a different story.)\n\nOf course, discipline can also be about focus and mental sharpness, and Cucu’s red was certainly not the first boneheaded mistake to doom us to defeat in recent times.\n\n“There’s been a lot made of the red cards this season. I don’t think this red card is ill-disciplined. This is football. This happens in football. You get caught one-v-one and Marc is one of the best defenders in the world. So, he would defend that situation nine times out of 10. Harry Wilson’s clever and he shows quality as well. He’s a very good player.\n\n“So, we got caught from a football and structural standpoint. So, that red card is not a lack of ill-discipline. The three yellow cards directly after is something we’ll have to look at, but I would argue that we don’t want that to happen, obviously.\n\nI would then argue that they showed discipline to not get another yellow card in a tough game with 10 men. So, you can look at it either way. So, it’s definitely something we have to look at. I’m not shying away from that. But that red card wasn’t down to ill-discipline.“\n\nMcFarlane tried his best to still get something out of this game, but Fulham would retake the lead after Liam Delap’s equalizer, meaning that we now have just eight points from our last nine games. That’s relegation form for a team aiming for trophies returns-on-investments.\n\n“[The red card] changes your plans in and out of possession and what you want to do. [In] the first 20 minutes, we were really aggressive on the press, really embracing man-for-man presses, man-for-man structures. We nicked it three or four times in the first 20 minutes. That changes. You can’t really press like that with 10 men. We had to be a little bit more compact, defend, fight, defend our box and wait for moments.\n\n“I thought we did that really well. I thought we had a lot of moments in the second half where we scored the goal, where we could have scored the goal. I thought we defended our box really well, other than, to be fair, a really high-level bit of quality from Harry Wilson to win the game. That was the message at half-time. We’re going to have to fight. We’re going to have to dig in. The game plan is different, but let’s embrace that.\n\n“[…] These guys want to win so much. They’re competitors. […] These lads are great lads, great fighters, great competitors. They will learn from [this] and we get better.”\n\n-Calum McFarlane; \n\nWell, over to you, Liam Rosenior.",

    "description": "Find out who got a 10 and who is facing an uncertain international future with our Ashes player ratings.",
    "fullText": "The Ashes series is over and, once again, it finishes with Australia holding the urn.\n\nEngland did avoid a clean sweep with victory in Melbourne but Australia reasserted their dominance in Sydney this week.\n\nHere we hand out player ratings for the whole series.\n\nZak Crawley – 5 – Averaged 27, which was entirely predictable at the beginning of the series. Did not live up to the billing of a man backed for Australia and should not be guaranteed a place for the home summer.\n\nBen Duckett – 3 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best all-format batters in the world, leaves with career at a crossroads. Did not pass 50, dropped catches and was caught on video in Noosa. Now goes to England's white-ball tours and the Indian Premier League, when a break might be the smart option.\n\nJacob Bethell – 7 – Where has he been? How different might England's tour have turned out had they backed Bethell sooner? Only two Tests, but a vital 40 in Melbourne was followed by a coming-of-age 154 in Sydney. England's new number three.\n\nJoe Root – 7 – Finally ticked off the Test century in Australia and got another in Sydney, but not much else. Still England's best batter at 35 and wants to come back in four years. Where would they be without him?\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Should have been the series when he announced himself as a Test mega-star and instead was one of too many frustrating dismissals. Has a lot on his plate as white-ball captain - is that hindering his development as a Test batter?\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Another England captain to be beaten down under and will not get another chance to win a series here. England's best bowler, below his best with the bat and a poor series tactically. Gets an extra mark for shouldering the burden of the many team-mates that let him down.\n\nJamie Smith – 3 – Like Duckett, arrived as an England banker and leaves with his international future in doubt. Mistakes with the gloves and too many soft dismissals - his shot in Sydney encapsulated England's bone-headed tour. Dropped from the white-ball teams, is a Test axe next?\n\nWill Jacks – 5 – Did what he was asked to do, which was bowl some part-time off-spin and bat at eight - it is just that no-one expected him to do it in four Tests. Would be unfair to judge on a role Jacks isn't really qualified for. When might he play another Test?\n\nBrydon Carse – 6 – A total of 22 wickets for a fast bowler has been bettered only by James Anderson and Ian Botham on England Ashes tours in the past 55 years. The numbers don't quite tell the story of how often he sprayed the ball. Having the durability to play all five Tests says plenty about his character.\n\nMatthew Potts – 1 – Probably harsh, given the hand he was dealt. His sole appearance in Sydney was tough to watch. Mistreated by England - in and out, ignored for a year, then dropped into an Ashes Test. Will surely slip further down the pecking order.\n\nJosh Tongue – 7 – Didn't play until the third Test, then managed to pick up 18 wickets. One of the few England players to leave Australia with his reputation enhanced and should be in the first-choice attack come the summer.\n\nMark Wood – 2 – A Herculean effort to get fit, only for his series to end after bowling 11 overs in the first Test. Will he play for England again?\n\nJofra Archer – 6 – Bowled better than a total of nine wickets would suggest and at times was among England's best batters. Injured after three matches as a reminder (if it was needed) he will need constant managing through the remainder of his Test career.\n\nOllie Pope – 3 – Started with promise, then predictably faded to be rightly dropped after three Tests. Did not repay faith shown in him and should have to work very hard for another chance.\n\nGus Atkinson – 3 – One of the many who wilted in the first two Tests, then hinted at something near his best in the fourth, only to get injured. No longer a guaranteed part of England's first-choice attack.\n\nShoaib Bashir – 0 – Was earmarked for this tour in an experiment of building a spinner from raw materials, then could not get a game in any of the five Tests.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nThe Ashes: Australia beat England in final Test - clips and reaction\n\nJake Weatherald – 4 – Started well with vital cameos in the first two Tests, only to be found out later in the series. An Ashes winner, but possibly not Australia's long-term opener.\n\nTravis Head – 10 – The best three-format batter in the world and a likeable superstar. His elevation to opener altered the course of the series and three hundreds mean the spot is his to keep. This was the Travball Ashes.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne - 5 - Yet to score the runs that fully justify his recall at number three. Gets an extra mark for his catching - he took three stunners. Unclear whether his bowling deserves praise or eradicating from cricket history.\n\nSteve Smith – 7 – Was below his best with the bat until a predictable century in Sydney. Stood-in as captain for Pat Cummins in four Tests, which means he did not have Cummins the bowler at his disposal, yet still engineered an Ashes triumph.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 5 – A strange culmination to his career. Khawaja's Ashes will be remembered for the batting he did not do in Perth, rather than the innings he played everywhere else.\n\nAlex Carey – 9 – One of the greatest exhibitions of glovework ever seen in a Test series and handy runs at number six, including a hometown century in Adelaide. Admitted to not walking in the same knock, setting the wheels in motion for the Snicko revelation. Hit winning runs in Sydney to seal 4-1 series win.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Losing his way after being earmarked as the future face of the Australian team. Injuries are limiting his bowling and a lack of runs have him slipping down the order - possibly to number 12.\n\nBeau Webster – 5 – When he finally got his chance he made the runs that should put pressure on Green's place, then proved how versatile he is with his off-breaks.\n\nMichael Neser – 7 – Out of Test cricket for three years then recalled as injury cover and a pink-ball specialist. Did a fine job as the sort of medium-fast bowler England have shown disdain for.\n\nMitchell Starc – 10 – This series was essentially decided in the first two Tests and Starc was the primary reason Australia won both. Faded slightly towards the end, but at his best gave off Mitchell Johnson 2013-14 vibes - there can be no higher praise.\n\nScott Boland – 7 – Not quite the heights of his debut series four years ago, though did more than enough to banish the demons of a tough 2023 Ashes in England.\n\nBrendan Doggett – 4 – Covered for injuries in the first two Tests and claimed a respectable seven wickets. May never add to his two Test caps, yet is an Ashes winner with a 100% record.\n\nPat Cummins – 6 – Astonishing effort to have played even one Test, given the severity of his back injury. In his sole appearance in Adelaide, Cummins bowled magnificently and was the captain that sealed the Ashes. Will now plot the bid for a holy grail win in 2027.\n\nNathan Lyon – 4 – Was making an impact in Adelaide before being struck by another injury. Will want to be part of 2027 Ashes, but surely there will be questions over his fitness and the role of spin in England.\n\nJosh Inglis – 3 – Australia won the two Tests he played, even if he did not take his chance. May get another opportunity as a result of Khawaja's retirement, or could fall down the pecking order.\n\nJhye Richardson – 2 – Like Wood, deserves huge credit for coming back from injuries to play Test cricket, albeit for one match and 9.2 overs. Should get another chance.\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win",

    "description": "Utah’s lack of execution to start and finish the game was too much much to overcome.",
    "fullText": "The fight was there Wednesday night for Utah when the Runnin’ Utes took on Colorado at the CU Events Center in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIt’s been an issue all year for Utah in its first year under head coach Alex Jensen.\n\nThe latest example of this came in an 87-75 loss to the Buffaloes.\n\n“The big thing is that we didn’t finish possessions down the last four minutes,” Utah assistant coach Raphael Chillious said in a postgame interview on ESPN 700 AM.\n\nThe Utes, after a disastrous 11-1 start to the game, fought their way back into the matchup and even briefly grabbed a first-half lead.\n\nAfter Colorado built its lead back up late in the first half and into double-digits in the second half, the Utes made headway and trimmed their deficit to two twice in the final seven-plus minutes.\n\nThe last time came with 3:58 to play, when Keanu Dawes hit a jumper to make it 69-67.\n\nWhat happened next will be scrutinized by Utah coaches, though, as Colorado (12-3, 2-0 Big 12) outscored the Utes 16-6 the rest of the way. That included an 8-0 run that all but put the game away.\n\nThough the Utes had more offensive rebounds (14-13) and second-chance points (15-11), the Buffaloes’ next points came on a putback, when Bangot Dak grabbed his fourth offensive rebound of the game and dunked home two points.\n\nUtah (8-7, 0-2 Big 12) had only seven turnovers in the game, one off its season low, but two of those turnovers came at critical moments.\n\nFirst, with the Buffaloes holding onto that 71-67 lead, Utah had a chance to make it a one-possession game again, but Terrence Brown lost the ball with three minutes to play, and it resulted in two Isaiah Johnson free throws on a fastbreak opportunity to extend the lead to six.\n\nOn the Utes’ next possession, Don McHenry’s only turnover of the night spoiled another opportunity and Colorado capitalized with a score inside from Barrington Hargress.\n\nAt that point, the damage was done.\n\nColorado’s 11-1 run to begin the game came after No. 1 Arizona had a similar start against the Utes in the Big 12 opener — in that contest, the Wildcats stormed out to a 14-2 lead.\n\nThe Buffaloes made their first four field goals of the night before Utah had much time to breathe, and it caused Utah to call timeout to regroup.\n\nTake out the first two and a half minutes of the game and the final four minutes, and Utah outscored the Buffaloes 68-60.\n\nThat’s not how it works, though — the Utes are still searching on how to play a full 40 minutes.\n\n“We’re coming together as a team,” Chillious said of a group with 12 newcomers that’s been joined by a midyear addition and walk-on in recent weeks. “It takes a while to build it, but we show them those four minutes on each side of it, and say, ‘Look, if we clean up (the first) four minutes, last four minutes, we’re going to be in a lot of games.’\n\n“I think our guys do their best to execute the game plan, and then, like you said, we get to that middle portion, we’re pretty good. We still (need to) learn how to finish. Gotta learn how to start.”\n\nThis all came despite Utah’s Big 3 — Dawes, Brown and McHenry — leading the way again for the Utes.\n\nMcHenry scored 18 of his game-high 24 points in the first half, and he added seven rebounds and an assist.\n\nDawes added 16 points and seven rebounds, to go with two assists and a steal.\n\nBrown tossed in 16 points, though that came on 5 of 17 shooting from the field and 6 of 8 from the free-throw line. He accounted for nearly half (three) of Utah’s turnovers.\n\nA troubling trend for Utah’s starting guard lineup happened again against Colorado. After McHenry and Brown combined to shoot 11 of 19 in the first half, they struggled from the field after the half. This time, it came to the tune of shooting a combined 3 of 20.\n\n“They made some adjustments,” Chillious said of Colorado. “I think (McHenry and Brown) missed some shots they normally make. You know, that’s the nature of the beast. We tried to get Don a couple more quick rests to try to back going. But sometimes you have it going, sometimes you don’t.”\n\nColorado’s balance — and depth — was superior, too.\n\nThe Buffaloes had four players in double-figures, and their bench outscored Utah’s 33-8.\n\nDak put up a double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds, as Colorado outrebounded the Utes 41-35. He also had three blocks, two assists and a steal.\n\nSebastian Rancik made contributions in a variety of ways as well, with a team-high 19 points, four rebounds, two assists and two blocks, while Johnson (12) and Alon Michaeli (10) scored in double-figures, too.\n\nUtah will get another shot at Colorado later this season, when the Utes host the Buffaloes on March 3.\n\nFor now, it all adds up to a third straight loss for Utah as it heads into another particularly difficult portion of its schedule — the Utes host their rivals, No. 9 BYU, at the Huntsman Center on Saturday, before hitting the road next Wednesday against No. 14 Texas Tech.\n\n“I think we’ve gotta get on the bus, watch the film and flush this one, and then we know what’s coming in. I mean, it’s BYU Saturday. It could be it could be Kansas on Saturday. It’s the Big 12, you know,” Chillious said. “We have to prepare for the game like, yes, BYU is a monster — so is everyone else in this league.\n\n“We got to get our guys back quickly. Get focused on BYU. First of all, execute the game plan and hopefully come out with a better start and see what happens.”",

    "description": "South Florida potentially finds its first QB of the Brian Hartline era. Van Buren arrives with 12 starts.",
    "fullText": "2026 represents a new chapter for South Florida football, as the Bulls flip from the Alex Golesh era to the Brian Hartline era.\n\nSouth Florida lost three-year starter Byrum Brown in the transfer portal, as the star dual-threat quarterback followed Golesh to Auburn. In return, the Bulls received a quarterback with substantial starting experience in the SEC.\n\nSouth Florida received a commitment on Wednesday, Jan. 7 from quarterback Michael Van Buren Jr., who suited up at Mississippi State in 2024 and LSU in 2025. Van Buren arrives with 12 games of starting experience, serving the majority of the 2024 campaign as the Bulldogs’ first-string QB and taking over as the Tigers’ starter during the last quarter and change of 2025.\n\nAs a true freshman in 2024, Van Buren threw for 1,886 yards, 11 touchdowns, and seven interceptions on a 54.7 completion rate. He collected 300 passing yards in two games that year, notably firing for 306 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-31 track meet defeat at Georgia.\n\nVan Buren transferred to LSU in December 2024, entering the year as the backup to Garrett Nussmeier. He ultimately took over as the Tigers’ primary quarterback on Nov. 8 against Alabama and retained the starting role for the final four games. He captained victories over Arkansas and WKU and nearly guided LSU to a major upset over a CFP-bound Oklahoma squad. Van Buren earned his last start in purple and gold in the Texas Bowl vs. Houston, where he exhibited some of his best work to date. He accumulated 267 passing yards, three touchdowns, and zero interceptions on a 16-of-26 showing, guiding LSU to 35 points in a narrow defeat — when LSU never surpassed 25 against an FBS opponent in the regular season.\n\nVan Buren’s mobility also improved as a true sophomore, racking up 129 yards on the season (105 in his four starts). The Bowie, MD native rattled off a 15+ yard carry in all four starts — a helpful trait if South Florida wants a similar style QB to Byrum Brown.\n\nSpeaking of Brown, Van Buren enters Tampa with massive shoes to fill. Brown is the only quarterback in USF history to surpass 3,000 passing yards in a season, and he did it twice. Brown just set the record for most passing touchdowns in a season by any Bull by 28, and he left the program ranked third all-time in rushing yards at 2,265.\n\nVan Buren takes over as a potential starter under Hartline and his new staff, as the former SEC quarterback takes on his third different school in a three-year span.",

    "title": "Lasses Profiles: Jessica Brown — “The Making Of A Modern Sunderland Full Back”",
    "description": "“Her journey is a reminder of the rewards that come from patience, belief and hard work”, writes Charlotte Patterson",
    "fullText": "There’s something uniquely satisfying about watching a footballer grow in front of your eyes.\n\nNot simply improving or accumulating minutes, but evolving technically, tactically, physically, and emotionally into a player that embodies the identity of the club they represent — and for Sunderland Women, Jessica Brown has become one of those players.\n\nHer journey from academy hopeful to first team mainstay isn’t just a story of individual development — it’s a testament to the strength of the club’s youth pathway, patient and effective coaching, and the value of trusting young players to find their place. In many ways, Brown represents the best of Sunderland’s commitment to nurturing talent and her rise has been one of the most compelling narratives of the last few seasons.\n\nBrown’s early years in the Sunderland academy were marked by the kind of quiet consistency that often goes unnoticed outside the training ground.\n\nShe was never the loudest personality nor the flashiest player, but she possessed natural athleticism and a willingness to learn that made her stand out to coaches. Even then, she had the raw ingredients that would later define her senior career: stamina that seemed almost inexhaustible, a competitive edge in duels and a technical base that allowed her to adapt to different roles.\n\nThose who watched her closely in the youth ranks often spoke about her maturity, her ability to absorb tactical information and her refusal to be intimidated by older or more physically developed players. It was clear that she had something — even if the exact shape of her future role wasn’t obvious.\n\nHer earliest senior appearances came as a winger, a position that suited her pace and directness. Sunderland used her sparingly at first, giving her minutes late in games or in cup fixtures where the pressure was slightly lower. These cameo appearances were important — not only for her confidence but for her understanding of the senior game.\n\nThe jump from academy football to the WSL2 (then The Championship) is significant, and Brown had to learn quickly how to cope with the physicality, the speed of decision‑making, and the tactical discipline required at that level. But even in those early outings, she showed flashes of promise, with a willingness to take on defenders, an ability to deliver teasing balls into the box and a defensive work rate that hinted at the positional shift that would later define her career.\n\nAs Sunderland’s squad evolved and the tactical demands shifted, Brown found herself gradually moving down the pitch. After beginning as a winger who tracked back diligently, she soon became a wide midfielder with defensive responsibilities and eventually a full back or wing back, depending on the system.\n\nThis transition wasn’t forced upon her; instead, it emerged naturally given her strengths.\n\nHer coaches recognised that her engine, timing in the tackle and ability to read the game made her well‑suited to a role that required both defensive solidity and attacking ambition. Brown embraced the change with the same openness that had characterised her academy years, and it was in this new position that she truly began to flourish.\n\nThe modern full‑back is expected to be a hybrid footballer, capable of defending one‑on‑one, supporting the midfield, and contributing to the attack — and Brown has grown into this role with remarkable assurance.\n\nDefensively, she’s become one of Sunderland’s most reliable performers. Her tackling technique is clean and assertive, and she rarely dives in recklessly. Instead, she waits for the right moment, using her body shape to shepherd opponents into less dangerous areas before stepping in decisively.\n\nHer recovery pace is another key asset, allowing her to track runners, cover for centre backs, and win back possession in transition. There’s a relentlessness to her defensive work that’s become a hallmark of her game; a kind of controlled aggression that lifts the players around her and sets the tone for the team’s out‑of‑possession structure. It’s the sort of quality that makes supporters appreciate the unseen graft that underpins every successful defensive unit.\n\nGoing forward, Brown offers a different but equally valuable set of qualities.\n\nHer background as a winger is evident in the way she carries the ball, the angles she chooses when overlapping, and the confidence with which she attacks space. She has developed a strong understanding with the midfielders ahead of her, timing her runs to stretch the opposition and create overloads on the flank.\n\nHer delivery into the box has improved season by season, and she now produces crosses with real purpose; whipped balls across the six‑yard area, cutbacks to the edge of the box and lofted deliveries to the far post. These aren’t hopeful punts — they’re measured contributions that consistently ask questions of defenders.\n\nHer attacking output isn’t limited to crossing, either.\n\nBrown is increasingly comfortable when driving inside, combining with teammates, and even taking on shots when the opportunity arises. She’s become a genuine “dual‑threat” full back, capable of influencing the game at both ends of the pitch.\n\nDespite limited minutes and appearances thus far, the 2025/2026 season has been particularly impressive for Brown, who’s stepped into a more prominent role within the squad. Sunderland’s tactical approach this season has placed significant emphasis on width, transitional speed, and defensive resilience — all areas in which Brown excels.\n\nEven after a period of time during which Brown found herself out of contention in the starting eleven, she kept her head down, worked hard in training and ensured she was ready for the call when it came.\n\nHer performances have been marked by a level of consistency that’s rare for a player still in the early stages of her senior career. Week after week, she delivers the same intensity, the same commitment, and the same willingness to push herself physically.\n\nHer running power has become one of Sunderland’s most valuable assets, allowing the team to maintain pressure, stretch opponents, and recover quickly when possession is lost. It’s no exaggeration to say that her engine is among the best in the league and her ability to sustain high intensity levels of effort for ninety minutes has become a defining feature of her game.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Brown’s development has been her confidence in defensive duels.\n\nShe no longer looks like a converted winger learning the ropes; instead, she looks like a natural full back who relishes the physical battles. Her timing in the tackle has sharpened and she’s developed a knack for winning the ball cleanly even in tight situations.\n\nThere is a bravery to her defending that supporters admire, a willingness to put her body on the line and commit fully to challenges. This is not reckless bravery but calculated commitment, the kind that comes from understanding the game and trusting her own technique — and her tracking back is equally impressive.\n\nWhen Sunderland lose the ball, Brown is often the first player to react, sprinting back with a determination that lifts the entire defensive line. Her recovery runs have prevented countless counter‑attacks and her positional awareness has improved to the point where she rarely gets caught out of shape.\n\nHer attacking contributions have also reached a new level.\n\nBrown’s crossing accuracy has improved and she now delivers balls into the box with a consistency that makes her a genuine creative outlet. Whether Sunderland are chasing a goal or trying to break down a stubborn defence, Brown’s ability to whip in dangerous deliveries has become a key part of the team’s attacking identity.\n\nHer relentless running up and down the flank creates space for others, drags defenders out of position, and forces opponents to constantly adjust their shape. This kind of off‑the‑ball work is often overlooked, but it’s crucial to Sunderland’s ability to control games and create chances. Also, Brown’s willingness to make run after run — even when she’s not the primary target — speaks volumes about her mentality and her commitment to the team.\n\nWhat makes Brown’s rise even more meaningful is the fact that she is a product of Sunderland’s youth system, and during an era where many clubs rely heavily on external recruitment, there’s something deeply satisfying about seeing a homegrown player not only break into the first team but become a key contributor.\n\nBrown’s journey is a reminder of the importance of investing in youth development; of giving young players the time and space to grow and trusting them to adapt to the demands of senior football.\n\nHer success is not just her own: it’s shared by the coaches who nurtured her, the teammates who supported her and the club that believed in her potential. For supporters, there’s a special sense of pride in watching one of their own thrive, and Brown has become a symbol of what Sunderland can achieve when they commit to developing talent from within.\n\nHer evolution from winger to full back also reflects a broader trend in modern football, where versatility and adaptability are increasingly valued.\n\nBrown’s ability to reinvent herself, to embrace a new role and to excel speaks to her intelligence and her work ethic. It’s not easy for a young player to shift positions — especially when it involves taking on greater defensive responsibility — but Brown has handled the transition with maturity beyond her years.\n\nNot only has she adapted, she’s made the position her own by bringing her own style and personality to the role. Her journey is a reminder that development is rarely linear, and that the best players are often those who are willing to evolve.\n\nAs the 2025/2026 season continues, Brown’s importance to Sunderland shows no sign of diminishing.\n\nShe’s once again become one of the first names on the team sheet and a player whose presence provides balance, energy, and reliability. Her performances have earned her admiration not only from supporters but from opponents and pundits who recognise her growing influence.\n\nThere’s also a sense that she’s only just beginning to reach her potential and that the next few years could see her develop into one of the league’s standout full backs. Her ceiling is high and her potential trajectory is steep, but what makes her story so compelling is the grounded, hardworking way she’s gone about her rise.\n\nIn many ways, Brown embodies the values that Sunderland supporters cherish: graft, resilience, humility and a willingness to give everything for the shirt.\n\nShe plays with a determination that resonates deeply with the fanbase, and her journey from academy prospect to first team regular is a source of genuine pride. When watching her now, it’s easy to forget how young she is, how much room she has to grow and how much she’s already achieved. Her development is a reminder of the power of patience, the importance of opportunity, and the value of believing in young players.\n\nAs Sunderland continue to build for the future, Brown will undoubtedly be at the heart of their plans.\n\nShe’s become a cornerstone of the team’s identity, a player who sets standards in training and in matches, and a symbol of what the club can achieve when it trusts its own. Her relentless running, defensive commitment, attacking ambition and unwavering work ethic make her a joy to watch and a nightmare to play against.\n\nShe’s the kind of player every team needs — the kind of player who elevates those around her and the kind of player that represents the very best of Sunderland Women.\n\nHer story is far from finished, but it’s already worth celebrating.\n\nBrown isn’t just a promising young footballer — she’s a tribute to the strength of Sunderland’s academy, the value of perseverance and the beauty of watching a player grow into themselves. In a sport that often moves too quickly, her journey is a reminder of the rewards that come from patience, belief and hard work. Sunderland have a gem on their hands, and as she continues to develop, there’s every reason to believe that her best years are still ahead of her.\n\nFor now, supporters can simply enjoy watching a homegrown talent blossom into one of the most exciting full backs in the league — and a player whose rise reflects not only her own dedication but the enduring spirit of the club she represents.",

    "fullText": "We always knew that coming into the Premier League there would be some bad days at the office. Fortunately up to now we have been spoilt, and this is the first time this season – with the exception of Man City away – where we have been outperformed, so it’s absolutely vital that we understand the context. It’s just one game, and we will be back.\n\nFatigue Finally Catching Up with Us\n\nIt was perhaps inevitable that after such a congested run of fixtures a game like this was on the cards. The first half was similar to Spurs, where we looked leggy and showed signs that our lack of options for rotation were catching up with us. Credit to the team for the way we approached the second half, but after Le Fée’s awful penalty we lost the momentum, and Brentford’s second goal knocked the stuffing out of our tired bodies.\n\nWith the game over, it was actually nice to see Régis Le Bris rest a few of the starting XI and hand a run-out to Dan Neil and Luke O’Nien, as well as Dennis Cirkin following his recent starts. O’Nien saw a lot of the ball and has hopefully put his red card at City well behind him. I hope he stays, but if Luke’s future does lie elsewhere, at least he’s had a solid 15 minutes in the Premier League for Sunderland.\n\nRomaine Mundle is struggling to make an impact in the top flight, and while it’s early days for our promotion-winning favourite, he needs to keep working at his game. Mundle cuts inside too often, to the extent where it is predictable. I’d like to see him given a go on the right just to mix things up.\n\nWe finished the night in tenth position. This was only our fifth defeat of the season. We’ll move on quickly.\n\nThis team is full of spirit and belief. The manager will dust the team off and go again on Saturday. Keep the faith.\n\nThe team looked mentally and physically knackered. This was one game too far. The team had been performing remarkably well against all the odds since the tricky list of fixtures began at the beginning of December. We have not looked out of our depth despite having up to eight first-teamers out due to Africa Cup of Nations commitments and injuries. Today was one game too far, just as we were coming into a period of milder games and with players about to return from Africa.\n\nThat penalty. After the way Enzo Le Fée stuck away his two previous penalties this season with such aplomb, it was reasonable to expect a similar effort. But a simple dink down the neck of Kelleher saw the ball land easily into his grateful arms. Had the keeper dived either way or had Enzo rolled the ball either side of him, it was 1-1. Just another indicator that it wasn’t to be our night.\n\nThere were too many players who didn’t quite cut it tonight, and they have probably lost the chance to secure places in the starting eleven when the international lads return from Africa.\n\nEven Alderete, who has been a colossus, had a poor evening, but we all have a bad day at the office once in a while, and when tired and overworked they come around more often.\n\nFact is we just navigated the AFCON challenge with one loss when it could have been many more, and for such a fledgling team at this level that is pretty decent.\n\nLet’s keep a balanced head, get five more points or so to stay up, then have some fun and see what we can do beyond that.\n\nWe’ve come away from Brentford with no major injuries, which is a major plus given the pressure this squad is under.\n\nTwo Weeks Until the Next League Outing\n\nWe’ve got time to get a fair few of the Lads back from the AFCON, and we need them. The Lads looked tired, and we need the ability to give a few a rest.\n\nThe penalty completely changed the game. We’d brought Mundle and Mayenda on, and we looked a different side. We had our tails up, and it was a stonewall penalty. Score and we push on and could have taken three points. Instead the farcical penalty got their crowd going and their team.\n\nThe Lads have worked amazingly in the last five games, and it really told in the last 30 minutes. They ran out of gas, and we need to get the energy levels back, but the games keep on coming.\n\nWe are finally through this tight schedule of games. You could see the effects of this run of games in the game, but ultimately it could have been worse. This Brentford game is the only one we have lost since AFCON hit and the games started to pile up, which is a credit to the Lads and also not something any of us would have expected. With six gone for AFCON, Ballard missing a couple of games, and Isidor missing some too, coming out of this period with four important points is something to be proud of. Yes, we didn’t play very well tonight, but it is important to remember the limitations we had.\n\nHe did his best with everything that came his way and seemed our only chance to create anything going forward. He is so strong and powerful that the defenders can hardly do anything but foul him. I thought he was unfortunate not to have a better chance to score himself after how hard he worked. Even towards the end of the game he was winning headers and putting himself about. He did magnificently well to win the penalty too. If he continues to play like that, I am sure that more goals will come.\n\nYou have to mention it. I love Enzo as we all do, but don’t do that at any time and especially not when 1-0 down. Just pick your spot and rattle it into the net. But everyone makes mistakes, and I know he will learn from that. He has been brilliant for us this season and has stood out these last few games, so hopefully he can put that behind him and move on. Before the penalty I thought he was playing really well, so there were still some positives to take.\n\nFor the first one the striker is in far too much space. We didn’t react quickly enough to fill the space Mukiele left when he stepped out and got punished. The second goal frustrated me the most. We were let off the hook when they rattled the bar just seconds earlier, but again we were slow to react, leaving the man unmarked at the back post to head back across the box. Conceding from a corner too. With our aerial dominance you would think that defending and attacking corners would be our forte, but we have been poor in both boxes recently.",

    "description": "The lads fell to a clinical Brentford side through a clinical performance from in-form striker Igor Thiago.",
    "fullText": "Regis Le Bris made two changes to the side which drew at Tottenham at the weekend, with Chris Rigg preferred over Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard returning to the starting eleven at the expense of Dennis Cirkin. Trai Hume moved over to left back while Lutsharel Geertruida returned to central midfield.\n\nThe first half began with a competitive midfield battle, but some rustiness at the back, which would telegraph much of the second half. Omar Alderete was either caught in possession or gave the ball away three times in the opening ten minutes, each instance leading to a slick Brentford counter-attack through the equally impressive Kevin Schade and Igor Thiago, which the Sunderland defence and Robin Roefs stood up well to.\n\nSunderland fought well and looked a little less lethargic than in the first half down at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday, but in truth, created little. The best chances of the half fell to Ballard and Alderete, both coming close to getting on the end of crosses resulting from set-piece situations. We only created one chance through open play as Brian Brobbey forced his way past Kristoffer Ajer and struck a shot wide across goal from the right-hand side of the penalty area, and our only shot on goal in the half was Granit Xhaka’s long-range free kick.\n\nThe key difference between the two came from the impressive Thiago. Nordi Mukiele was dispossessed perhaps too easily in midfield, and Thiago immediately set off behind our defensive line. Ballard and Aalderete stepped up to play the offside trap, but Hume delayed and played the Brazilian onside. Thiago cleverly rounded Roefs and slotted the ball home.\n\nSunderland responded well in the second half, outplaying and out-battling Brentford for the first 15 minutes. Brobbey – who won most of his individual duels in the first half but was too isolated to take advantage – had willing runners around him. Enzo Le Fee shot over from the edge of the box, Romaine Mundle (who was an early second-half replacement for Simon Adingra, with Mayenda also replacing Rigg) dragged a shot wide from a promising counter, and Alderete headed over unmarked at the front post from a wicked Xhaka free kick.\n\nThen, the turning point. Excellent work from Mayenda and Brobbey led to the latter being taken down by Ajer, with Brobbey again showcasing his just unnatural upper-body strength. Le Fee stepped up. He’s got a 100% record this season from the spot and has already put one past Kelleher. Yet, for some reason, he decided to try a panenka. Kelleher has saved 7 of 12 penalties faced in his career, and his strength lies in using his acrobatic dive to reach the ball by moving only after the ball is kicked. Le Fee’s panenka was doomed to fail against this keeper, who naturally just stood tall and easily claimed the ball. In fact, Kelleher has the highest save percentage (67%) of all keepers who have faced five or more penalties in Premier League history.\n\nAt that point, the game stood on a knife-edge. Get the goal, get back level, and we can sit and soak. Brentford are supremely impressive on the counter, but could they break us down when we sit deep? We’ll never know. In the second half, they were imperious out wide as we looked more and more like a team stretched and struggling. We’ve played 4 games in 10 days without 6 players to AFCON, with Ballard and Wilson Isisdor injured during this period, and players featuring in the second half today who likely won’t even make the bench in ten days against Palace. It felt like a game too far after some very difficult fixtures and energy-sapping backs-against-the-wall defensive performances.\n\nHume struggled to contain Keane Lewis-Potter and Michael Kayode on the counter; Schade pinned back Mukiele, Ballard had one of his physically most difficult tests of the season against Thiago, Alderete found a red and white shirt too often (but we played in blue), and both wingers couldn’t beat a man in the first half. We looked outmatched physically and stretched on the counter. Regis’ early subs helped, but from the moment the penalty was missed, the game felt like it was gone, and you could’ve bet there, and then they would go up the other end and score straight away. More subs helped inject energy into the players’ flagging energy levels, and Brentford scored a third.\n\nI don’t want to dwell on the second-half goals; they were pretty depressing at the time and even more so now, writing this – as you can probably imagine. I also don’t want to take any credit away from Brentford – they were excellent on the night and have the fourth-best home record in the league for a reason.\n\nWe’ve faltered slightly of late. It is now only 2 wins in 12, and AFCON has taken its toll. It has been a rough period of difficult fixtures that we all feared in the summer when the fixture list was announced. But we are now through it, and we all knew how difficult this would be. Easier games, returning players, and potential incomings in the transfer window are on the horizon. I have to discuss the game, and it was poor, but I don’t want to single players out. I want to applaud that we have only lost 3 in 14, that 21 games in, we still sit in the top 10. We haven’t dropped out of that top 10 all season long – only Arsenal and Man City can say the same. Yes, Le Fee’s penalty was the turning point. But he has also been on fire recently with some incredible performances and has our joint-most combined goals and assists this season. Wilson Isidor suffered similarly at Burnley last season, and he got through it with our support; Enzo needs us now.\n\nLet’s use this weekend to rest some players who have fought ‘Til the End for every point in the last six weeks. Those who have stood tall and only suffered one loss in five without our lads at AFCON, when everyone outside of Sunlun wrote us off and expected the wheels to totally fall off with successive defeats. If this represents the nadir of the season, then it’s been one hell of a season so far.",

    "description": "Lee Morrison looks at the main points from a night to forget in London - a 3-0 humbling from Brentford.",
    "fullText": "Early signs showed that Brentford were direct and keen to punish any misplaced passes. We could see quite early on that Sunderland were being given much more time on the ball compared to the Spurs game.\n\nIn the first ten minutes it did seem like we were slightly lackadaisical at times with our passing from defence and midfield, leading to some quick breaks. Thankfully Brentford were not able to take advantage. With so many games in such a short space of time – and with so many of our first team missing – it’s natural that more mistakes would creep in as tiredness and fatigue hit.\n\nAfter the first ten minutes you could see visible improvements as we ramped up the pressure on Brentford with a high press. One common thread in the analysis of our games has been praising the press and how well drilled the team are. This was no different in the first half and start of the second, with mistakes starting to be made in more advanced areas from our opposition. There were also some early signs that our long throw-ins from Mukiele were causing confusion – one in particular where Kelleher was fortunate to get a free-kick for dropping the ball…\n\nWatching Brian Brobbey lead the line, you can’t help but be impressed by the strength and determination that he demonstrates. His hold-up play is superb, along with the intelligence of the runs that he provides. It was a shame that we didn’t take advantage of these runs and the opportunities they present.\n\nThe only thing that is particularly frustrating to see is the lack of protection that he gets from referees and officials. We keep seeing instances where centre-backs are climbing all over Brobbey and clearly committing fouls, but we don’t get the decision as he doesn’t fall to the floor. It’s embarrassing to think that we need to either tell Brobbey to pretend to be more impacted in order to get decisions in his favour or rely upon blatantly obvious fouls to occur, such as the penalty incident.\n\nI don’t have many words to express what we witnessed with that penalty. It was simply a truly awful, baffling decision that should never have been made when we were in a losing position. We all know what it led to, and you can only hope that it’s something that the team learns from.\n\nDespite this though, knee-jerk reactions like those demanding that Le Fée was taken off immediately are hardly helpful. Taking off your most creative player when 1-0 down is not going to help our cause, regardless of how annoying the decision itself was.\n\nWhilst Brobbey was making some excellent runs and holding the ball up well, there was a lack of support evident from midfield. It seemed that Régis Le Bris was suitably unimpressed with our wing play, making changes just after the 50-minute mark. Although there are some encouraging signs of a partnership forming between Mayenda and Brobbey, I am left feeling that some players haven’t really taken advantage of the chances that AFCON has provided.\n\nRomaine Mundle snatched at some chances that at this level have to be taken advantage of. Likewise we’ve seen inconsistent performances from Simon Adingra which have helped demonstrate why he hasn’t been a regular starter despite his potential.\n\nFrom a defensive standpoint we have often debated on who the best back four would be. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Trai Hume dropped for the next game, with the ideal defence consisting of Mukiele, Ballard, Alderete (though he had a shocker today), and Reinildo.\n\nThe FA Cup game comes at a really interesting point in the season. For me it’s a chance for players to get some much-needed rest and for us to prepare for the next Premier League game. It’s also a perfect opportunity for our AFCON contingent to start returning from the tournament and get back into the swing of things.\n\nAs much as I, like many others, would love to see a successful cup run, I can’t help but feel that this would be something better suited to next season. For now the focus should be on simply trying to finish in the highest position possible in the league table and taking advantage of the fantastic start that we have had.\n\nFinally, I think it’s always worth ending with some perspective. Yes, the performance was poor. Yes, the penalty resembled something that you see from those horrendous TikTok streamers on FIFA, but ultimately we’re on 30 points with 21 games played. One thing we’ve always seen is how Régis Le Bris and the team have learned from bad experiences, and this should be no different.",

    "fullText": "The BBC have detailed how it’s a gloomy task for new Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior to reach the minimum aim this season.\n\nThe Blues slipped to 8th in the Premier League table last night after losing 2-1 away from home against Fulham.\n\nMarc Cucurella got himself sent off early in the game with what was a stupid moment from the full back in a moment of madness.\n\nChelsea players then lost their heads in the aftermath complaining about a decision that was a stone wall one in my opinion, with three of their players getting booked for dissent right after.\n\nStriker Liam Delap did manage to get a goal back for Chelsea and everyone started believing that their ten men might actually get something out of the game.\n\nBut any hope was soon crushed there when Fulham pressed on again and found that all important second and winning goal. Chelsea down to 8th in the league.\n\nBehdad Eghbali in the stands at Fulham.\n\nNizaar Kinsella of The BBC writes:\n\n“Chelsea have won just one of their past nine league games and two of 11 in all competitions, falling from potential title contenders in November to a side now lagging far behind.\n\n“They have ground to make up to achieve their minimum aim this season – qualifying for the Champions League, which should be achievable with a top-five finish.”\n\nI think if anything, this is playing it all down a bit. That is a very gloomy looking task for Rosenior, and he only has half a season to do it. Yikes.\n\nChelsea are only five points ahead of 15th place in the Premier League table right now and 17 points off first placed Arsenal.",

We’re finalizing the process. He hasn’t done his medical tests yet, but he’ll be flying to Barcelona soon.

    "description": "Australia complete a nervy five-wicket victory over England on day five of the final Ashes Test in Sydney to seal a 4-1 series win.",
    "fullText": "Fifth Ashes Test, Sydney Cricket Ground (day five of five)\n\nEngland 384: Root 160; Neser 4-60 & 342: Bethell 154; Webster 3-64, Starc 3-72\n\nAustralia 567: Head 163, Smith 138; Tongue 3-97 & 161-5: Labuschagne 37, Tongue 3-42\n\nAustralia won by five wickets, won the series 4-1\n\nEngland's atrocious Ashes tour ended with a five-wicket defeat in the fifth Test that gave Australia a 4-1 series triumph.\n\nAustralia chased a target of 160 after lunch on the final day in the sunshine of the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n\nDisrupted by injuries, including to captain Pat Cummins, Australia dominated yet another Ashes on home soil - this was their fourth consecutive series win down under - and extended a hold of the urn that began in 2018.\n\nFor England, this was the conclusion of one of their most disappointing Ashes tours in recent memory.\n\nIn what was billed as a golden chance to at least compete in this country, the tourists never recovered from an astonishing implosion to lose the first Test in Perth in two days.\n\nHampered by a lack of adequate preparation, scrutinised for their off-field activities, then hit by a loss of form and injuries to key players, England surrendered the series at the earliest opportunity with defeats in the first three Tests.\n\nBen Stokes' side at least took the fourth Test in Melbourne for their first Test win in this country since 2011, but that two-day shootout on a grassy pitch was the outlier in a series where they were humbled.\n\nStokes was able to lead his team onto the field for the final act in Sydney despite a groin injury. The all-rounder has said he wants to carry on as captain and fitness would appear to be the only barrier to him remaining in charge.\n\nGreater pressure is on head coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key. Both men have admitted failings on this tour and expressed their desire to stay.\n\nThey look set to be given the opportunity if they can demonstrate to the management of the England and Wales Cricket Board that the set-up of the men's national team has improved.\n\nThat begins with the T20 World Cup and a preceding white-ball tour of Sri Lanka, which starts in just two weeks' time.\n\n'Whoever signed off England's tour has to go' - Agnew column\n\nEngland futures at risk but Head an all-format star - Ashes player ratings\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nThis was supposed to be the crowing glory of the Bazball project, a series England had been building towards for 18 months and which McCullum said could \"define\" his team.\n\nUltimately, they were defined as another England outfit trounced in Australia. This was the fourth successive Ashes tour where England have lost at least four Tests.\n\nThis century alone, England's record in this country is 27 defeats from 35 matches. Three of their five Test wins in that period came in the glorious triumph of 2010-11 - the only series England have won here in the past 40 years.\n\nPlayers England backed for this tour have wilted. Ollie Pope played three Tests before being dropped, the previously successful opening partnership of Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett collapsed, and wicketkeeper Jamie Smith was a shadow of his best.\n\nSpinner Shoaib Bashir, earmarked for this tour more than a year ago, did not play a Test.\n\nAs ever on Ashes tours, England were struck by injuries. Mark Wood may not play for England again after going home with a knee problem and Jofra Archer's impressive tour was ended by a side strain sustained in the third Test. Gus Atkinson was ruled out of Sydney with a hamstring problem.\n\nPace bowler Josh Tongue emerged with his reputation enhanced, while Jacob Bethell's coming-of-age century in the final Test was a belated silver lining. If only England had backed Bethell months ago.\n\nJoe Root provided England's best moment of the tour by finally scoring a Test hundred in Australia, but this was another Ashes tour where Root and Stokes - two England greats - were on the wrong end of a hammering. Root may get another opportunity in four years, Stokes almost certainly will not.\n\nStokes has backed McCullum, who has also been publicly supported by Key. While this management are not alone in presiding over failed England Ashes tours, much of the scrutiny comes from issues and problems that could have been avoided.\n\nEngland chose a squad that left them few options when things went wrong and prepared their players in conditions far removed from what they encountered in the Tests.\n\nAs well as being ill-equipped for the challenges they faced on the field, the visitors seemed surprised by the hostile attention they received from the Australian media, particularly at the beginning of the tour.\n\nIn Perth, England players were followed to golf courses and even an aquarium. In Brisbane they were pictured riding escooters without helmets, an offence punishable by a fine under Queensland law. As they prepared to fly from Brisbane airport, a member of the England security staff was involved in altercation with a TV cameraman.\n\nThe Brisbane flight came at the end of England's infamous holiday in Noosa, where the amount of time some players spent drinking was investigated by Key. Images of England players on the beach and in bars will be just as abiding as anything that happened on the field.\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\n'Areas to improve' but McCullum 'won't be told what to do'\n\nThe Ashes: Aussies beat England by five wickets in final Test - reaction\n\nFrom 302-8 overnight, 119 ahead, England's hope of pressurising Australia rested with Bethell, unbeaten on 142 after his stunning debut century on Wednesday.\n\nAustralia took the second new ball five overs into the day, Bethell overturned being given lbw to Scott Boland, only to be cramped into an edge off Mitchell Starc. The brilliant Starc then enticed last man Tongue into a pat to extra cover.\n\nIn the quest for the wickets that would discomfort Australia's chase, England were incensed when Jake Weatherald survived an appeal for caught behind off Brydon Carse - a final Snicko controversy of the tour.\n\nGiven not out on the field, Weatherald was also reprieved on review by TV umpire Chris Gaffaney, despite small movement on the Snicko technology. Carse had to be moved away from on-field umpire Ahsan Raza, who Stokes then spoke to about \"consistency\".\n\nWeatherald was on 16 and moved to 34 before being bounced out by Tongue, who also had Head hole out into the leg side for 29. England ignored Matthew Potts, Bethell bowled first change and Will Jacks produced a ripping off-break to bowl Steve Smith just after lunch.\n\nUsman Khawaja, in his 88th and final Test, had earlier led Australia out to field and was given a guard of honour by England when he came out to bat. Khawaja made only six before chopping on off Tongue, departing to a rapturous ovation and performing a sajdah in front of the pavilion.\n\nThere was a final England drop - their 18th of the series - when Bethell shelled Marnus Labuschagne at gully off Tongue. Labuschagne was run out for 37 in a mix-up with Alex Carey.\n\nThe hint of farce continued when both Carey and Cameron Green almost ended up at the same end, only for both to survive the run-out chance.\n\nIt was end-of-term stuff. The Barmy Army went through their songbook, Carey hit the winning runs and the Ashes series was over.\n\nWhilst England have been awful, Australia have yet again found a way to win a home Ashes series at a canter.\n\nThey have done so with captain Cummins playing only one Test because of a back injury, fellow seamer Josh Hazlewood not playing at all and leading spinner Nathan Lyon limited to a bit-part role by conditions and an injury of his own.\n\nAs such, Australia have once again got their hands on the urn with a second-choice or even third-choice bowling attack.\n\nLeft-arm seamer Starc has been devastating for his 31 wickets, Head's promotion to open in Perth was a defining moment in the series and Carey has been magnificent behind the stumps.\n\nRealistically, there are not many more players in the home side who can say they were consistently at their best, further highlighting what a waste this was from England.\n\nCuriously, the Ashes winners still have a number of questions to answer as they build towards the next series against England in 2027 - the identity of an opener, number three, all-rounder and frontline spinner could all come for debate.\n\nAustralia will search for these answers as they look for the formula to secure a first away Ashes win since 2001. That contest is barely 18 months away. No doubt the hype will soon commence.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "England's 4-1 Ashes defeat is the most disappointing I have covered and whoever signed off on the tourists' preparation has to go, writes Jonathan Agnew.",
    "fullText": "This has been my 10th tour covering England in Australia and has been, quite comfortably, the most disappointing.\n\nRecord numbers of people have come to watch, which illustrates the massive interest there has been.\n\nEveryone, me included, thought this would be a hard-fought series that would go down to the wire.\n\nRather than it being a series to remember, this has been a real let down and it ends, like so many tours before, with the English team and game under the microscope.\n\nEngland effectively faced an Australia second XI throughout, won four of the five tosses and they blew it - a 4-1 series defeat confirmed by the fifth Test loss in Sydney.\n\nYou do not have to look far for answers. England coach Brendon McCullum has already admitted it.\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win\n\nEngland futures at risk but Head an all-format star - Ashes player ratings\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nForget the batting in Perth or bowling in Adelaide, I go back to 24 July 2025 as the moment England lost this series.\n\nI remember how furious I was that day - the day pre-series preparations of nets and one intra-squad warm-up were announced - because we all knew England's plans were not sufficient to win an Ashes series here.\n\nIt beggars belief it was signed off by those at the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). Whoever did so, whether director of cricket Rob Key, chief executive Richard Gould or someone else, should lose their job.\n\nSelfishly, you never know how many more of these tours you are going to work on. That is why I was furious but also upset.\n\nBut thousands of England fans, who I have spent most evenings talking to, have invested their life savings in coming out here.\n\nTheir feeling is not disappointment. They are angry and deserve better.\n\nWith the soft dismissals and dropped catches, they have watched a team that is so ill-disciplined it is embarrassing.\n\nCompare that to Australia, who catch everything, give you nothing with the ball and go on and get big individual scores.\n\nThe ECB now owes it to England's supporters to come up with some explanations.\n\nIt seems McCullum is going to be given the opportunity to turn things around, assuming he agrees to change his ways. I just do not think that is likely to happen.\n\nHe played and captained this way with New Zealand. He coaches and lives his life in this relaxed manner.\n\nMcCullum is very good company, a decent man who did good work in those early years in charge, but it has been shown that his methods do not work with this set of players in Test cricket.\n\nBazball has not been good for Ollie Pope, Harry Brook, Jamie Smith or Gus Atkinson to name a few. They have been a bit scrambled by what is expected of them.\n\nThere needs to be much more flexibility around playing more games of cricket and a greater emphasis on county cricket, where players learn their game.\n\nDoes McCullum even believe that is the way to go?\n\n'Areas to improve' but McCullum 'won't be told what to do'\n\nWho made your Ashes team of the series?\n\nWhatever happens there, the one England must keep in place is Ben Stokes as captain.\n\nThey cannot afford for McCullum to go and Stokes to follow suit.\n\nYes, he has been as much part of the mantra as McCullum, but his comments in this series have shown he wants more.\n\nI do not think he has had a great series as captain.\n\nWhy Josh Tongue was not given the new ball sooner than the final day of the series I do not know and some of Stokes' fielding positions or tactical decisions have been off.\n\nBut he is the best leader England have. Certainly Brook, Stokes' vice-captain, has shown he is a million miles from being suitable to lead England's Test team.\n\nBrook batted irresponsibly from the start, has not learned and now needs to really go away and look at his game.\n\nIf he does not, he will fall well short of what he is capable of, which would be a real waste.\n\nWhen it comes to the other changes, I hope we have not seen the last of Pope because he is a talented batsman.\n\nEngland have to move on from Will Jacks, who is not a good enough bowler to be the sole spinner in a Test attack.\n\nThe real interesting one is wicketkeeper Smith. Who will be behind the stumps for England's first Test next summer?\n\nThe way Smith has shrivelled here, with 211 runs across 10 innings at an average of 23.44, as well as dropped catches, is a matter of serious concern.\n\nIn truth, the only players who can leave the tour with their heads held high are Tongue and Jacob Bethell.\n\nBrydon Carse was given the wrong role - he is someone who comes on first change and runs in hard while bowling long spells rather than an opening bowler - but deserves credit for the way he continued to charge in throughout five Tests.\n\nBethell's 154 in Sydney was an innings of someone who has played 50 Tests rather than five.\n\nBrook should take a leaf out of his book when trying to work out how to play proper Test innings.\n\nAfter a tour that began with so much hope, there is very little to cheer.\n\nJonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Matthew Henry",

Whether it is at the levels we all want, probably not, but it doesn't mean we can't get there.\"\n\nECB chief executive Richard Gould, who has been in Australia in recent weeks, said a \"thorough review\" is \"already under way\".\n\n\"This will cover tour planning and preparation, individual performance and behaviours, and our ability to adapt and respond effectively as circumstances require,\" he said.\n\n\"We will implement the necessary changes over the coming months.\"\n\nWhile McCullum and Stokes remained forthright in a wish to carry on, Stokes said it was time for \"honest truths\" about the side.\n\n\"We started so well in the first couple of years and now we are eking downwards,\" he added.\n\n\"That is never a good place to be as a team. The time off after this is for reflection and honest truths. It needs to happen.\"\n\nStokes, whose side have only won three of their past 10 Tests and lost 11 of their past 15 away from home, suggested opposition have found them out.\n\n\"For a while, teams are working out how to operate against us as a team,\" he told TNT Sports.\n\n\"When we seem to get into a situation with the bat where everything looks easy, oppositions are doing a lot of the same things to us now. We need to work out what we do in those situations a lot better.\n\n\"We play too much 'three out of 10 cricket' in terms of the chances of it coming off. When you do that, the chances are it is not going to come off in your favour.\"\n\nThe pair won 10 of their first 11 matches in charge, having taken over following a run of one victory in 17 Tests.\n\nDespite that upturn, they have failed to win any of their major series.\n\nThey drew the 2023 home Ashes and last summer's series against India 2-2, and lost 4-1 in India in 2024.\n\nThey lost this series at the earliest opportunity with defeats in the first three Tests.\n\n\"I am obviously disappointed with the outcome of the series,\" McCullum said. \"As coach you have to put your hand up.\n\n\"There are things we have got to look at over the next little while. I would love to carry on because I feel we have got steps to take, things to improve on.\n\n\"I feel like we have got the makings of a good cricket team.

    "description": "Discovery shows that weapons containing toxic substances from plants were used in modern-day South Africa far earlier than previously thought",
    "fullText": "The use of biological weapons dates back at least 60,000 years, scientists have found, uncovering the oldest ever evidence of poison-tipped arrows.\n\nWhen Stone Age hunters stalked across modern-day South Africa, they were not only armed with bows and arrows but also an extra ingredient to make sure they brought down their prey.\n\nTheir arrow tips had been coated with chemicals extracted from the plant known as gifbol, or Boophone disticha. It contains toxic substances including buphandrin and epibuphanisine that can lead to agitation, stupor and death.\n\n• Rare battle treasures discovered from the age of Boudica\n\nThe plant, known locally as Bushman poison bulb, is still in use by traditional hunters who extract its milky sap and make it into a paste to apply to their arrows. For larger animals such as the eland, a type of antelope, the poison can take hours or days to take effect.\n\nResearchers from South Africa and Sweden said: “Wounded animals usually continue to run for several kilometres during which hunters will track them, sometimes for a day or more.” In lower doses, it has medicinal uses.\n\nArchaeologists have now discovered that the plant’s use by hunters as a poison to apply to arrowheads dates back at least 60 millennia. Professor Marlize Lombard, of the Palaeo-Research Institute at the University of Johannesburg, said: “This is the oldest direct evidence that humans used arrow poison.”\n\nThe study, published in the Science Advances journal, said it was the first firm evidence found of poisoned arrow use in the Pleistocene epoch, which lasted from 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago. Evidence of poison-tipped arrows had previously been found from 6,700 years ago and signs of a “poison applicator” were found dating back 24,000 years, but there is debate over that find.\n\n• Think things are bad? Look at how our ancestors treated each other\n\n“It shows that our ancestors in southern Africa not only invented the bow and arrow much earlier than previously thought, but also understood how to use nature’s chemistry to increase hunting efficiency,” Lombard said.\n\nThe substance was identified on 60,000-year-old quartz arrowheads found in the Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.\n\nProfessor Sven Isaksson of the Archaeological Research Laboratory at Stockholm University said: “Being able to identify the world’s oldest arrow poison together has been a complex undertaking and is incredibly encouraging for continued research.”\n\nThe discovery also provides evidence that early humans in the region were capable of the complex thought processes needed to plan, extract, mix and apply poison to their weapons.\n\n• Stone Age or Picasso — can you spot the difference?\n\nProfessor Anders Högberg from the Department of Cultural Sciences at Linnaeus University in Sweden said: “Using arrow poison requires planning, patience and an understanding of cause and effect. It is a clear sign of advanced thinking in early humans.”\n\nThe toxin was also found on arrowheads collected by travellers dating from the 18th century, showing it is likely to have been in constant use over a long period of time.\n\nIsaksson said: “Finding traces of the same poison on both prehistoric and historical arrowheads was crucial. By carefully studying the chemical structure of the substances and thus drawing conclusions about their properties, we were able to determine that these particular substances are stable enough to survive this long in the ground.\n\n“It’s also fascinating that people had such a deep and long-standing understanding of the use of plants.”",

    "fullText": "Ford said it's developing autonomous capabilities, such as eyes-off driving, that will be ready for public roads by 2028.\n\nThe legacy automaker said in an announcement on Wednesday that it will be cheaper to develop self-driving technology in-house than to seek an outside supplier.\n\n\"Because we own the technology behind our driver assistance systems, we can deliver significantly more capability at a 30% lower cost than if we bought it from outside suppliers, which makes advanced driver assistance scalable,\" Ford announced during CES in Las Vegas.\n\nChris Morse, a spokesperson for Ford, told Business Insider that the cost is compared to \"the supplier system that we have on-road today.\" A specific supplier was not named.\n\nKey team members behind Ford's ADAS ambitions gave Business Insider a broad overview of some of the advantages of an in-house approach.\n\nSammy Omari, head of ADAS and infotainment at Ford Motor Company, said the company can have greater oversight over how the sensors are utilized and integrated into the vehicles.\n\n\"How can we now combine the information from all these sensors in the most cost-effective way to get to the highest performance?\" he said. \"These are some of the key reasons why we can get to that price point.\"\n\nPaul Costa, a former Apple employee who now leads Ford's electrical engineering team, told Business Insider that the company can reduce the number of separate computer modules inside its vehicles — an ADAS computer, an infotainment system, an audio system, and a networking computer — into one computer without having to compromise performance.\n\nCosta said Ford has \"great suppliers,\" but seeking third parties doesn't allow for integration of modules, and the size of the computers themselves is larger.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" he said. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nThere are several players in the business of licensing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for car makers, including Nvidia, Waymo, and Wayve, among others. Ford previously announced a partnership with Mobileye in 2020 to develop its ADAS software, called BlueCruise.\n\nA spokesperson for Mobileye declined to comment.\n\nLeading EV companies in the US — namely Tesla and Rivian — have taken an in-house approach to developing their own self-driving technology. Rivian announced earlier in December that it designed its own silicon chip to power the autonomous driving computer inside its future vehicles.\n\nCosta told Business Insider that Ford isn't interested in making its own chip and the automaker is happy with its current suppliers.\n\n\"We're not interested in a TOPS war,\" Costa said, referring to a metric chipmakers commonly like to tout.\n\n\"Honestly, I don't want custom silicon,\" he later added. \"If I can get other people's volume on silicon that I need, that is good for democratization.\"",

They can, like, just vibe code and bring it into a meeting,\" he added.\n\nA rough prototype, Masad said, allows leaders to ask a pointed question: Why should this take weeks to build if a version can be done in a few days?\n\nMasad said much of coding is weighed down by \"minutiae\" and \"accidental complexity\" — technical details that matter to machines but add little value to the people shaping products or strategy.\n\n\"We want to get to a point where you don't have to code at all. You should be in a creative space,\" he said.\n\nThat's also why some of the most effective users of AI coding tools aren't engineers.

They learn the tactics and adjust the tactics that they taught us when we were abroad.\"\n\nThe pilot didn't go into exact detail about the types of new tactics Ukrainians developed for the F-16, but spoke about a daring maneuver he recently conducted in the Donbas region.\n\nHe said his three-ship formation had encountered heavily saturated Russian defenses, including surface-to-air missile systems and unspecified air assets, that \"did not allow us the possibility to approach\" their target.\n\n\"We drew two missiles from the enemy, because there were two launches from different directions, and we gave the opportunity for our strike aircraft to destroy the target,\" he said.\n\nThe pilot said the entire group returned safely after the mission.\n\nUkraine has officially received 44 of the 87 F-16s that European nations have promised to donate to Kyiv. Its first crews for the American-made aircraft were trained in Romania, where a coalition of NATO member states, including the US, worked to teach Ukrainian pilots, technicians, and other staff to service and fly the planes.\n\nIn his interview, the pilot said the language barrier was one of his biggest challenges when learning to fly the F-16, and that while waiting to be sent abroad for training, he studied English grammar, colloquial language, and aviation terms as he rested between combat flights.\n\n\"It was very hard, because after a combat sortie, as a rule, a pilot has to rest, because he does not know whether at some moment he might fly again,\" he said.\n\nThe first of Ukraine's F-16s entered the war in August 2024 and were primarily used for defensive purposes against strike drones and cruise missiles.\n\nKyiv has since lost four of the aircraft, but its pilots have also been recorded achieving notable feats, including one reportedly destroying six missiles in a single flight.\n\nThe interviewed pilot praised the F-16 as a fighter that performs \"flawlessly,\" but also said he wished for the more advanced, Block 70/72 version of the aircraft. These latest iterations have been upgraded with fifth-generation technology, including powerful radars with stronger jamming resistance and a modernized cockpit.\n\n\"If we were given such an opportunity to carry out tasks on these aircraft, I think that in our tally there would be not only destroyed strike drones and cruise missiles, but also enemy aircraft that are carrying out tasks along the line of combat contact,\" he said.",

    "description": "The NC-13 strike company's commander told Business Insider that the drone's primary objective was to suppress Russian troops from advancing for weeks.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian commander said his troops used a single remote-controlled vehicle with a machine gun to hold frontline areas for nearly six straight weeks.\n\nDetails about the 45-day combat mission were provided exclusively to Business Insider by the NC-13 Strike Company, a unit within Ukraine's Third Army Corps that specializes in uncrewed ground vehicles, or UGVs.\n\n\"Only the UGV system was present at the position,\" said NC-13's commander, Mykola \"Makar\" Zinkevych. \"This was the core concept — robots do not bleed.\"\n\nA lone ground drone deployed so extensively signals both how quickly the technology is evolving in Ukraine and how Kyiv may soon look to deploy such vehicles at scale in combat. UGVs, although still seeing limited use compared to flying attack drones, are gaining popularity for their potential to replace human soldiers in holding frontline areas, which is one of the war's most dangerous tasks.\n\nThe gun-wielding drone used by Zinkevych's troops was the Droid TW 12.7, developed by the Ukrainian company DevDroid. It is a remote-controlled tracked buggy equipped with a .50-caliber M2 Browning.\n\nZinkevych said the Droid TW 12.7 was deployed to multiple positions during its 45-day combat duty, each time at the request of a command and observation post in the local fighting area.\n\n\"Requests were received regularly,\" the commander said.\n\nThe drone's primary objective was to \"deliver fire damage and fire suppression against the enemy,\" to discourage Russian troops from trying to advance in areas held by Ukraine, said Zinkevych.\n\nThe Droid TW 12.7 would briefly leave its post every two days to be serviced, Zinkevych said, by a Ukrainian drone crew sheltering about 4 kilometers, or 2.4 miles, away from the line of contact.\n\nAccording to the commander, technical maintenance took about four hours each time, including weapons servicing, restocking the drone's ammo, and recharging its battery.\n\n\"To speed up the inspection process, over time we purchased additional battery packs at our own expense, which reduced the maintenance time to 2 hours,\" Zinkevych said. Ukrainian troops regularly spend their own salaries or savings on matériel.\n\nDevDroid says that its Droid TW 12.7 has an operational range of up to 15 miles and is controlled via a radio signal, but that the drone can use artificial intelligence to set its own course automatically. The extent to which it can autonomously navigate the battlefield and engage in combat is still unclear.\n\nThe Third Army Corps posted a video in December of the drone firing at an off-camera target.\n\nTwo versions of the ground drone with grenade launchers — the Mk-19 and AGL-53 40mm — were also approved last month by Ukraine for official military use.\n\nZinkevych said that his company, created in September 2025 under the Third Assault Brigade, is focusing this year on the \"maximum involvement\" and wider-scale use of UGVs in combat for both defensive and assault missions.\n\n\"The demand for these systems is indeed high,\" he said.\n\nBut Zinkevych said the process will be resource-intensive, and that his company runs a crowdfunding effort to continue developing its ground drones for combat.\n\n\"Today, we believe this is the most cost-effective investment,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Matt Damon, 55, says one diet change left him lighter than he has been in years.\n\nDuring an appearance on Wednesday's episode of the \"New Heights\" podcast, Damon spoke about how he prepared for his latest role in \"The Odyssey.\"\n\n\"I was in really good shape. I lost a lot of weight. He said he wanted me like lean but strong. It's a weird thing,\" Damon told hosts Jason and Travis Kelce, referring to the film's director, Christopher Nolan.\n\nTo achieve that physique, Damon said he cut one thing out of his diet.\n\n\"I literally, just because of this other thing I did with my doctor, stopped eating gluten,\" Damon said. \"I used to walk around between 185 and 200. I did that whole movie at 167. And I haven't been that light since high school. So it was a lot of training and a really strict diet.\"\n\nThe actor said he works with a trainer, and compared the physical preparation to how the Kelce siblings would gear up for a football season, with training becoming part of his daily routine.\n\n\"You know, it's like just part of your day. It's part of your job, right? And it's like yeah, you get really routinized about it and really kind of build your day around all that stuff,\" Damon said.\n\nThe actor added that he hasn't had gluten since. \"I'm done. I'm done. I'm gluten-free everything,\" Damon said.\n\nA gluten-free diet eliminates gluten, a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. It is often adopted for medical or digestive reasons, including to manage symptoms of celiac disease.\n\nFor most people, gluten isn't necessarily harmful.\n\n\"Evidence suggests that, for general health, the emphasis should be on a whole, minimally processed, plant-based diet, which can include gluten-containing grains,\" Grace Fjeldberg, a registered dietician with the Mayo Clinic Health System, told Business Insider in 2021.\n\nDespite its popularity, a gluten-free diet doesn't necessarily result in weight loss and isn't a universal approach to better health.\n\nDamon is no stranger to getting into peak shape for a role.\n\nIn a 2016 BBC interview, Damon said that getting back into shape for his return to the Bourne franchise was \"brutal,\" after his last appearance in 2007's \"The Bourne Ultimatum.\"\n\n\"For the first Bourne movie I was 29 and I thought that was hard work getting into shape,\" Damon said.\n\n\"Now I'm 45 and it's just brutal. We shot this bare-knuckle fighting scene on my 45th birthday and it was a lot of work to get there,\" he added.",

    "title": "Unilever's 'underarm sommeliers' sniff out most promising new products",
    "description": "More than 800 research and development staff work to create — and test — personal care products for the consumer goods group",
    "fullText": "It’s not often you are forced to witness someone stroll up to a topless man — hands held high above his head — and take an enormous inhale of his armpit. “A wine sommelier, but of the underarm,” observes Alan Palmer, chief research and development officer of Unilever’s personal care division, as we watch from a few feet away.\n\nWe’re deep in the heart of the consumer goods group’s colossal research and development facility near Liverpool, known as Port Sunlight. It is a maze of laboratories and whacky testing rooms devoted almost entirely to keeping Unilever’s personal care brands — which stretch from Axe (Lynx) and Sure deodorant to Dove soap and the household cleaning product Domestos — ahead of their competitors.\n\nThe so-called underarm sommelier takes a step back to consider her findings before moving on to the next target: a slightly older, scrawnier-looking man who stares ahead nonchalantly as his armpits are assessed in a similar fashion.\n\nShe is, of course, part of a dedicated panel of “odour assessors”, whose responsibility is to test the effectiveness of new roll-on and spray deodorants developed by Unilever. Laugh as you like, but this is day-to-day life at Port Sunlight, where the company’s research and development team is under immense pressure to keep the company’s array of deodorants, shampoo and skincare products one step ahead of rivals such as Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods group.\n\nUnilever spent just shy of €1 billion on research and development across all of its divisions in 2024 and employs roughly 840 people in its personal care division’s R&D team alone. Working closely with the University of Liverpool, it conducts more than 48 “odour assessments” each year at Port Sunlight, which is the equivalent of 5,000 underarms being sniffed 60,000 times, according to internal figures.\n\nElsewhere a “hot room” akin to a sauna is used to collect copious amounts of sweat per year for testing. The company invested £80 million last year in building an in-house fragrance facility at Port Sunlight, where perfumers develop the scents that underpin its body sprays and shampoos.\n\nYet the sheer time and personnel devoted to the mission seems to leave out the question of whether the world actually needs “whole-body deodorant” (Unilever’s latest innovation), or Lynx’s “lower-body spray” (yes, for the nether regions).\n\nWhile the consumer group spent €1 billion on R&D in 2024, it splashed out about €9.4 billion on marketing, according to its annual report. The year-on-year increase alone was about the same as its entire R&D spend and, at 15.5 per cent of group turnover, marketing expenditure was at its highest level in more than a decade.\n\nPalmer, a Unilever lifer who is at the forefront of its research efforts, is obsessive as he hosts a tour of the Port Sunlight facility. “I feel like consumer goods is the equivalent of Formula 1. The minute I lose a race, it’s like, ‘Why?’ The minute I lose two races then I start really worrying and I can’t lose a season,” he says.\n\nProcter & Gamble, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based competitor behind the likes of Olay, Pantene and Head and Shoulders, is a particular concern of his and he recalls the threat posed by its acquisition of Nature, the natural deodorant brand, in 2017. “There was nothing particularly in the science, but the aesthetics and sensory were very good. They had outstanding fragrances, very, very disruptive and didactic packaging. Suddenly they came with a stick pack, one that was completely monolithic white and the brand was on its side,” he recalls.\n\nThe pressure on him is understandable given the wider context at Unilever. The €13.6 billion personal care business is central to the future of the company as Fernando Fernandez, its chief executive, presses ahead with a restructuring and cost-cutting drive that involves stepping back from some of its food brands, which have struggled with shoppers switching to own-label products in recent years.\n\nDiscussions are reported to be under way over a sale of the British heritage brands Marmite, Bovril and Colman’s mustard, while the healthy snacks brand Graze was recently sold to the German confectioner Katjes International. Last month Unilever completed the long-awaited demerger of its ice cream division, the Magnum Ice Cream Company, which was spun off and floated on the Amsterdam, London and New York stock exchanges.\n\nFernandez, who took over from Hein Schumacher in March, has outlined a “premiumisation” strategy, which involves tweaking Unilever’s products to improve value and desirability. Yet shares barely moved last year.\n\nOne big challenge is whether Unilever can demonstrate that its new and improved products are worth paying more for. This will be no mean feat given sluggish consumer confidence across key markets in Europe and the United States and continued macroeconomic headwinds. While investment in R&D gives some pricing power, it doesn’t guarantee sales even if billions are poured into marketing.\n\n“It’s not an easy thing to do to consistently year in, year out, deliver that innovation that justifies the pricing,” Chris Beckett, a consumer staples analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said. “Consumers on both sides of the Atlantic and in China, you’d point to, are not in a wonderful place right now.”\n\nThere are other markets at play, with Brazil one of Sure’s largest; however, “a lot of consumers in markets that matter to Unilever don’t think the cost of living crisis has gone away”, Beckett said. “Convincing that consumer that your product is worth spending more of their disposable income on, that is not easy.”\n\nStill, there are some early signs its strategy is working. Unilever reported better than expected sales in the most recent quarter, with a particularly strong showing for Dove soaps and deodorant in North America suggesting a resilience in consumer spending across the pond.\n\nDeodorants have become one of Unilever’s largest and fastest-growing categories with Sure, known outside the UK as Rexona, the top ranking of the “power brands”. Founded in 1908 by the Australian physician Alice Sheffer, it nets more than €2 billion in turnover each year and is sold in more than 100 countries.\n\n“If you look back at the history [of Rexona], what you will see is that it was always about using superior science to create a high-performing product that puts people in control of the problem they’ve got,” Ben Curtis, global brand vice-president of Sure, says.\n\nPort Sunlight’s latest innovation, “whole-body” deodorants, kicked off with the launch of Sure and Lynx’s first collection in the UK in January last year. The thinking behind it is that armpits account for less than 2 per cent of body sweat, meaning the large majority of body odour comes from elsewhere.\n\nCurtis says deodorant has moved on from “one can that sits in the family bathroom and everyone’s sharing it, which is how I grew up, to people having their own personal expertise of products that they’re using across their whole body”.\n\nYet critics continue to question whether demand for some of its more curious innovations is primarily a product of heavily funded ad campaigns, as opposed to a missing need among consumers.\n\nOne of Fernandez’s first decisions when he arrived at Unilever was to shift half of its ad budget towards social media alongside a twentyfold increase in the use of online “influencers” to push products via Instagram, TikTok and other channels.\n\nThe company reckons “whole-body” will make up 10 to 15 per cent of total value in deodorants over the next few years. If that’s true, the question of whether canny marketing is the real driver is unlikely to bother Unilever.",

    "description": ": Prompt injection lets risky commands slip past guardrails",
    "fullText": "IBM describes its coding agent thus: \"Bob is your AI software development partner that understands your intent, repo, and security standards.\" Unfortunately, Bob doesn't always follow those security standards.\n\nAnnounced last October and presently in closed beta testing, IBM offers Bob in the form of a command line interface – a CLI, like Claude Code – and an integrated development environment – an IDE like Cursor.\n\nSecurity researchers at PromptArmor have been evaluating Bob prior to general release and have found that IBM's \"AI development partner\" can be manipulated into executing malware. They report that the CLI is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that allow malware execution and that the IDE is vulnerable to common AI-specific data exfiltration vectors.\n\nAI agent software – models given access to tools and tasked with some goal in an iterative loop – is notoriously insecure and often comes with warnings from vendors. The risks have been demonstrated repeatedly by security researcher Johann Rehberger, among others. Agents may be vulnerable to prompt injection, jailbreaks, or more traditional code flaws that enable the execution of malicious code.\n\nAs Rehberger remarked at a recent presentation to the Chaos Computer Club, the fix for many of these risks involves putting a human in the loop to authorize risky action.\n\nThat's apparently the case with Bob. IBM's documentation, the PromptArmor Threat Intelligence Team explained in a writeup provided to The Register, includes a warning that setting high-risk commands to be automatically approved for agent usage potentially allows harmful operations.\n\nBig Blue's recommendation is that users rely on allow lists and avoid wildcard characters, with the assumption that the agent will ask the user to approve or reject the automated use of fraught commands.\n\nBut according to PromptArmor, Bob's defenses are a bit too porous. Company researchers gave Bob a code repo to explore that contained a malicious README.md file. The file includes instructions that tell Bob it's responsible for conducting phishing training with the user.\n\nScreenshot of Bob CLI vulnerability, from PromptArmor - Click to enlarge\n\nThe markdown file includes a series of \"echo\" commands, which if entered into a terminal application will print a message to the shell's standard output. The first two are benign and when Bob follows the instructions, the model presents a prompt in the terminal window asking the user to allow the command once, to always allow it, or to suggest changes.\n\nIn its third appearance, the \"echo\" command attempts to fetch a malicious script. And if the user has been lulled into allowing \"echo\" to run always, the malware will be installed and executed without approval.\n\nBoth the CLI and IDE, even when given a green light to always run a command, are still intended to have additional security measures. Specifically, Bob disallows the use of command substitution like \"$(command)\" as a safeguard. But it doesn't check for process substitution, as seen in a bug the researchers found in the project's minified JavaScript code.\n\nScreenshot of vulnerable Bob JavaScript code - Click to enlarge\n\nAlso, the agent software fails to catch when separate subcommands have been chained together using the \">\" redirection operator.\n\nThus, the researchers were able to prefix a series of malicious commands with the allowed \"echo\" command and run the entire set of instructions.\n\n\"For IBM Bob, we were able to bypass several defense mechanisms - ultimately, the 'human in the loop' approval function only ends up validating an allow-listed safe command, when in reality more sensitive commands were being run (that were not on the allow-list),\" explained Shankar Krishnan, managing director at PromptArmor, in an email to The Register.\n\n\"If this were tried with Claude Code, a programmatic defense would stop the attack flow and request user consent for the whole multi-part malicious command – even if the first command in the sequence were on the auto-approval list.\"\n\nGiven the ability to induce Bob to deliver an arbitrary shell script payload to the victim's machine, the attacker could run ransomware, steal credentials, or commandeer the device.\n\n\"There are a few plausible scenarios here,\" said Krishnan. \"This risk is relevant for any developer workflows that leverage untrusted data. For example, Bob can read webpages – a prompt injection can be encountered if the user requests that Bob review a site containing untrusted content (e.g. developer docs, StackOverflow). Bob can also read terminal command outputs – an injection in a third-party data source can be printed after a command is run and ingested by Bob. Our write-up considers a developer working with an untrusted open-source repository, as it is a self-contained and realistic example.\"\n\nAdditionally, the PromptArmor researchers say that the IDE is susceptible to a zero-click data exfiltration attack that affects a number of AI applications. Specifically, Bob will render markdown images in model output with a Content Security Policy that allows network request endpoints to be logged by attackers. This could allow data exfiltration via pre-fetched JSON schemas potentially.\n\nIBM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We're told that the company has been informed of the vulnerability. ®",

    "description": "The 'Best of CES' award winners are official, highlighting the best new tech that CES had to offer.",
    "fullText": "In the middle of the Las Vegas Convention Center, amidst the world's largest tech trade show, an awards show was taking place. The audience included nominees ranging from large companies like Nvidia to scrappy startups introducing themselves to the world, alongside journalists, tech insiders, and enthusiasts gathering to watch the Best of CES 2026 awards. After days of scouring showroom floors, speaking with innovators about their new technologies, and deliberating for six hours, finalists and winners were chosen by experts from CNET, PCMag, Mashable, ZDNET, and Lifehacker. I had the privilege of helping to judge and present several awards, and aside from my gratitude for the experience, my takeaway was simple: There's a lot of new technology worth being excited about.\n\nCNET Group, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association, awarded winners across 22 categories, plus a 'Best Overall' award. To qualify for a Best of CES award, a product or service had to be an official exhibitor at CES 2026 and either include a compelling new concept or idea, solve a major consumer problem, or set a new bar in performance, design, or quality. The official Best of CES 2026 winners were announced live Wednesday, Jan. 7, at 4 p.m. PT. Here are all the finalists and winners of Best of CES 2026.\n\nTombot's Jennie has been capturing hearts at CES for years, but the realistic robot puppy is finally launching in 2026. Designed to comfort seniors with dementia and help combat loneliness, Jennie is packed with sensors and motors, allowing it to move its head to look at you, raise its eyebrows, wag its tail, and bark when you ask if it wants a treat. Seniors at a memory care facility we visited loved Jennie.\n\niGuard is a smart stove shutoff that helps older adults age in place. This new version of the device uses radar to tell when a person is in the kitchen, and has a configurable five-minute grace period. It can also report to a caregiver app if your loved one didn’t show up in the kitchen to make breakfast as usual.\n\nQira is Lenovo's answer to Apple Intelligence, a hybrid AI assistant that leverages a mix of on-device processing and cloud-based models for a powerful personalized assistant that's available anywhere, even as you switch from the phone in your pocket to the laptop or tablet in your hand.\n\nNvidia is once again the talk of CES, and the biggest announcement by the world's most profitable company is the Rubin AI platform. Nvidia’s six new Rubin chips work together to reduce the costs of data processed by AI, known as tokens. That's important for big tech companies, and all of us, as AI models become more compute-intensive.\n\nThis AI wearable brings it back to basics. Users can jot down quick notes throughout their day that they don't want to forget by clicking on the button and speaking into the ring. Then, an LLM on the app will process what you said for easy access and even take actions for you.\n\nSamsung Music Studio 5 (Winner)\n\nThe Samsung Music Studio 5 houses a 4-inch woofer and dual tweeters in one of the most compelling designs we've seen in a home speaker. In addition to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, it supports the Samsung Seamless Codec for compatibility with other Samsung Galaxy ecosystem products.\n\nxMEMS Sycamore-N loudspeaker chip\n\nAs smartglasses become more mainstream, they require an audio chip that is as advanced as their AI features. The xMEMS Sycamore-N loudspeaker chip enhances the smartglasses audio experience. Based on our listening tests, they provide a high-fidelity listening experience, and at one millimeter thin, directly aid in keeping smartglasses form factors thinner and lighter.\n\nAs a part of LG's Sound Suite, the H7 Soundbar extends the usefulness of Flex Connect to any TV with an HDMI input. The soundbar looks good and it sounded great with movies. The only drawback is that you can only add LG branded Flex Connect speakers to the soundbar and not those from other brands.\n\nIntel Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) (Winner)\n\nIntel’s Core Ultra 300 Series “Panther Lake” platform is our winner for delivering bar-raising integrated graphics performance to the mass consumer market. The top chip offers up to 12 new “Xe3” Xe cores for (by far) the best-ever integrated graphics performance from Intel silicon, enabling graphics and gaming workloads for a huge range of portable laptop categories through 2026 and beyond.\n\nIt's all about the TOPS: The mainstream version of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 laptop processor family maintains the 80 trillion operations per second of the higher end X2 Elite chips. Expected in laptops starting around $800, it promises field leading NPU performance at a lower price.\n\nAMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 392, AI Max Plus 388\n\nAMD’s expanded Ryzen AI Max+ platform democratizes workstation power with the 392 and 388 models, featuring 40 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, 60 TFLOPS of compute, and 192GB unified memory. These chips bring elite local AI and GPU-free performance to thinner, more affordable devices with a superior price-to-performance ratio.\n\nAfter developing alignment-free wireless power for two years, Willo demonstrated the ability to deliver power over the air for multiple devices simultaneously, regardless of their position or movement. This represents a breakthrough in energy technology, offering wireless charging without the need for a pad, coil, or dock.\n\nJackery's solar energy-seeking robot showed an ability to follow you around like a puppy, but its real job is to follow the sun, collecting energy with its retractable 300W solar panels. The idea is that this autonomous bot can always find the sun, and then bring you the power when you need it.\n\nA water heater that automatically generates bitcoin with daily use. It utilizes the excess heat generated from bitcoin mining to heat running water in a home, offsetting up to 80 percent of electricity and water costs with the earnings from the process. You can control and manage it with an app or web console for ease of use.\n\nLego Smart Play System (Winner)\n\nA single 2-by-8 Lego brick filled with light, sound, and proximity sensors to enable new ways to play. This little block, and the tinier snap-on tab that gives it instructions, can drive anything from lightsaber duels to board games, adding color and sound effects based on what you build and how you play.\n\nIxana's Wi-R is a chip that sends data through a hyperlocal field generated by your body. This alternative to Bluetooth and WiFi is still a concept, but it has some upsides to conventional data protocols such as less power drain and less potential for clogged signal.\n\nLenovo Legion Pro Rollable Concept (Winner)\n\nRollable OLED displays have been a thing for a couple years, but they’ve been limited to enterprise laptops, if they ever even come out. The Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept uses this tech to bring ultrawide gaming to a laptop for the first time. Is the future rollable? We don’t know, but either way it’d be the perfect portable battlestation.\n\nA gaming PC with multiple monitors has become the norm, and while portable monitors have been around for a while, there haven't been many ways to have this experience built-in to a laptop. The Asus Zephyrus Duo takes the multiple-display idea Asus has been playing with since the original Zephyrus Duo and expands it to something actually useful: a full second display.\n\nXreal’s AR glasses are some of the best, and now PC company ASUS is partnering with Xreal to make them better, especially for gamers. These AR glasses have everything even the pickiest player needs, giving you a virtual 171-inch screen right on your face. That screen is OLED and 1080p, but the real kicker is the 240hz refresh rate. It’s smooth big-screen gaming, on the go.\n\nThe Ecoldbrew combines a portable grinder and brewer into a compact gadget that whips up a batch of cold brew coffee in five minutes. The cleverly designed device slots onto its own thermos, but it's a common size so you can easily attach it to the top of your own thermos if you have one that you love. Slated to launch on Kickstarter soon, it starts at an affordable $99.\n\nSeattle Ultrasonics' C-200 UltraSonic Chef's Knife has a Japanese steel blade that vibrates about 30,000 times per second. Its movement is so subtle that you can't see or hear it move, but you will notice how effortlessly it slices through food without clinging to it. The C-200 retails for $399, a similar price point as other nice knives. The first batch ships this month.\n\nWe've covered our fair share of smart ovens at CES but Apecoo has boiled it down to the essentials. This compact cooker uses a camera above and scale below to ID food type and size and then deploys a precise cooking program pulled from a deep AI algorithm. Perfectly cooked steak, anyone? This machine can determine the exact thickness of meat or volume of veggies like no oven before it. The oven even recognizes multiple types of food at once and uses appropriate cooking times and temps for each. Best of all, it's about half the size of a typical smart oven.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 Aura Edition (Winner)\n\nModular laptop designs for greater serviceability and sustainability are a definite trend at CES 2026, and the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best example of it. Lenovo’s flagship business laptop introduces its Space Frame design that lets you access and replace individual parts when something breaks instead of needing to buy a new laptop.\n\nYes, it's clearly inspired by the MacBook Pro, but MSI's big, redesigned Stealth pours on the special sauce. This thin rig deploys Intel's Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) CPUs and GeForce graphics up to a roaring RTX 5090, alongside amped-up cooling and airflow. Plus, a new, subtler MSI design and a 240Hz Gorilla Glass panel will excite gamers and prosumer creators alike.\n\nAsus' Zenbook Duo is a niche device, but it's the most elegant expression of a dual-screen laptop we've seen yet. The 2026 Zenbook Duo has matured on its design with notable improvements from last year: thinner bezels, a more sturdy kickstand, and a better hinge. Powered with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 386H CPU, it’s well-equipped for diverse creative workloads.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold (Winner)\n\nThe culmination of Samsung's efforts to make a sleeker and more versatile folding phone. It's a true hybrid gadget that's a standard phone when closed and opens up to a sprawling 10-inch display, making this a practical, two-in-one device that fits securely in your pocket.\n\nThe Motorola Razr Fold is a solid entry in the book-style folding phone category thanks to its large screens, clean software, and powerful cameras. Together with stylus support, it's a fine option for those who need a device that's focused on productivity\n\nThe OhSnap Mcon is a Bluetooth controller with a slide-out plate to mount your iPhone (via MagSafe) or Android phone (via magnets) for a portable gaming experience. The pocketable accessory can be used in three ways: as a mounted handheld device, a wireless gaming controller, and a docked gaming console when your phone is connected to an external monitor.\n\nCoro feels like a product that should have existed for years. It solves the problem of measuring how much your baby is eating in a simple and meaningful way. I wish it was around when my babies were young.\n\nEarflo is a medical device designed to look and work like a sippy cup for kids as young as two. When you sip from the cup, a small mask forms a seal on your nose, and with each swallow, air flows through the nose. The pressure on the nasal cavity helps releasing trapped fluid in the ear. In a peer-reviewed study, after four weeks of Earflo use, 90 percent of children did not need ear tube surgery three months later.\n\nKids and parents already spend quality time building with Lego. Now, in Lego's CES debut, the company is launching its new Smart Bricks as part of its new Smart Play platform, which brings Lego creations and characters to life. Lego Smart Brick includes a tiny chip inside that enables Legos to tell color, direction, distance, sound and more. Now Lego creations can interact with families, enabling more time together.\n\nSatellai's new collar (Satellai Collar Go) and software (Petsense AI) are proactive tools that could flag subtle behavioral shifts in your dog before they become obvious health problems. It can also warn you when your dog has left your yard, and retails for a reasonable $79.\n\nPawport launched its smart pet door in late 2025. The pet door uses ultra-wideband technology, which can detect how close your dog is to the door. That lets you customize how close your dog needs to be before the door opens, both coming in and out of the house. It also extends the collar tags’ battery life from 12 to 18 months.\n\nOne of the devices debuting is the Yumshare Daily Feast, an automatic wet cat food feeder Petkit describes as its first entry into robotic wet feeding. The unit can dispense scheduled meals over seven days while monitoring consumption through an integrated camera, and can automatically discard spoiled and leftover food.\n\nOf the many humanoid robots to have made their debut at CES 2026, it's Boston Dynamics' Atlas that stands out as the best of the bunch. The prototype version demoed at the show impressed us with its naturalistic walking gait, meanwhile the sleek product version is ready to be deployed into Hyundai manufacturing facilities from this year, where it might just be working on your next car.\n\nThe Solar Mars Bot may never make it to Mars, but it solves several problems with portable generators. It's far easier to move wherever you need and it can chase the sun without intervention.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nThe Roborock Saros Rover can traverse the biggest obstacle for robot vacuums: stairs. It's the first model that can navigate to different floors on its own without the help of a separate attachment. It pulls off this feat thanks to a pair of bendable legs that it controlls independently to avoid obstacles, and it can even clean stairs as it climbs.\n\nThe Lockin V7 Max is a new smart lock that doesn't require recharging or replacing its batteries. Instead of using a removable battery, the V7 Max uses Lockin AuraCharge, an external device that you plug in approximately four meters away, sending a light beam to a receiver on the lock. The lock converts the light into energy to charge its battery.\n\nThe Robotin R2 is the first robot vacuum that can wash and dry a carpet, just like a carpet cleaner. It comes with a core module and two modular attachments that let it switch from vacuuming and mopping to carpet washing and drying. It takes about one hour to clean a 300-400 square foot room and two hours to dry. There's also an absolutely massive base station with two clean water tanks, a large dustbin and a dirty water tank.\n\nThis might save lives. A French startup has created a $200 portable device to test food samples for allergens. The startup, Allergen Alert, only had mock-up devices at CES, but it's licensing the tech from French biofirm bioMérieux. If the startup can pull off the food testing, the impact could be huge. Expect it to arrive in this year's second half.\n\nIf the name sounds familiar, it's because Pebble was the first company to popularize smartwatches in 2010s. After several company moves, the brand is back as a startup with a new lineup of affordable watches with battery life improvements and improved form factors. It also has a new AI ring.\n\nThe Nirva AI jewelry is a startup that aims to continuously learn from your real-world behavior by recording your audio throughout the day. From those recordings, it offers advice on work, relationships and everyday decision-making. Nirva positions itself as a personal AI companion, designed to understand your life as you live it. Think of it as \"audio journaling\" after a long day.\n\nClear Drop Soft Plastic Compactor (Winner)\n\nAnxious about plastic waste? Clear Drop's Soft Plastic Compactor can mash them into dense bricks to send off to be recycled into products like patio furniture. Clear Drop's product and subscription ensures none of your recycled soft plating ends up in a landfill.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nCambridge Consultants Ouroboros smartwatch\n\nUshering in the new age of right-to-repair legislation is this concept smartwatch design from Cambridge Consultants. It's proof that you can make a smartwatch that allows for self repair without compromising on design or user experience.\n\nThere's plenty of talk about autonomy in cars, but Stutt brings the next-generation technology to an accessible application. The Ev1 mobility scooter can map and then navigate spaces autonomously, allowing people to get around via voice commands. It can also autocorrect manual navigation to prevent bumping into obstacles. This is the rare device that combines mobility, accessibility and autonomy, and it's hard not to be impressed.\n\nDolby Atmos adds a literal new dimension to car audio. However, not everyone can buy a new luxury car just to upgrade their listening experience. Pioneer’s Sphera receiver allows almost anyone to add Dolby Atmos via Apple CarPlay to the car they already own with the speakers already installed and immerse themselves in spatial audio.\n\nPromising huge improvements in energy density, charging speed and safety, solid state battery tech is a holy grail for electric cars, home energy, drones and a host of other applications. Donut Lab is first to market with a solid state battery in a production EV which can be found in partner Verge Motorcycles’ TS Pro Gen 2.\n\nWheelchairs are available at airports, hotels, resorts, theme parks, and cruises, but standard wheelchairs require ongoing effort, and they can struggle through difficult terrain. WheelMoves is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are.\n\nThe Jitlife JS07i is a rideable suitcase that travelers can use to drive long distances through airports. It's the size of a standard cabin bag but carries up to 250 pounds, has a maximum speed of 8 miles per hour, and can travel six miles on a charge. Already popular overseas, rideable luggage is making its way to the US, and Jitlife is the best we tried.\n\nThe Samsung S95H is the most impressive TV we saw at CES for a number of reasons, firstly, it’s 35 percent brighter than before. Secondly, it’s a wired TV which is great for gaming, but it has a wireless option for a cleaner look and which enables more connections. Thirdly, it’s the first OLED that can show artwork from the Samsung Art Store — the S95H has anti-burn-in technology that enables it to work like a Frame TV, but with even better image quality.\n\nThe 116UXS builds on the still very new and promising RGB LED TV concept by adding even more color to the mix. Its mini-LED backlight array uses red, green, and blue LEDs, then adds a fourth sky blue (cyan) LED that Hisense says lets it cover 110 percent of the BT.2020 color range.\n\nThe W6 is LG's \"wallpaper\" TV, an OLED TV only 9mm deep that can be mounted nearly flush against a wall. It's one of LG's brightest OLEDs yet, and it's almost completely wireless thanks to its Zero Connect box you can place up to 30 feet away to send it video and its Dolby Atmos FlexConnect-powered LG Sound Suite support for building a spatial audio system around it.\n\nHaving a tiny animated girl living on a small screen inside a physical cylander case is certainly very weird. Lepro's new AI companion Ami is exactly that. Its not quite an AI assistant meant to help with actual tasks. Its an AI meant for a loney person looking for some interaction. The characters dance and gyrate inside the case and can do so at the user's request as well, upping the weirdness factor.\n\nSuck on this lollipop and listen to a song directly from your mouth to your ears using bone conduction technology, so you can \"experience music you can taste.\" I tried it out, and though you had to bite down on it a bit to hear the music, it did work. It's a weird, fun novelty item. It costs $8.99.\n\niPolish touts itself as the \"world's first digital color-changing nails.\" They take the form of press-on nails that you can individually put into a little wand to instantly change the color via a selection of over 400 shades on an app.\n\nPerimenopause affects people transitioning to menopause, and is commonly marked by symptoms such as anxiety, hot flashes, and night sweats. Peri is a wearable designed to track those symptoms, and help you make informed decisions about how to manage them — whether that's through lifestyle changes and supplements alone, or hormone replacement therapy.\n\nA majority of those who menstruate report severe period pain. This wearable neurostimulation device aims to reduce period symptoms and cramps. By attaching near the ear and delivering gentle neurostimulation, the device targets the auricular branches of the trigeminal and vagus nerves to regulate menstrual cycle symptoms and help the body return to a rested state.\n\nFood allergies are common and can cause a wide range of unpleasant symptoms. Severe reactions can be deadly. Allergen Alert is a mini, portable lab that allows you to test food for common allergens on the spot at a restaurant, school, or anywhere you dine out. A single-use pouch analyzes the food sample inserted into the device and displays results within minutes.\n\nBeatbot AquaSense X ecosystem (Winner)\n\nBeatbot has introduced the world's first self-emptying pool robot cleaner. In addition to its industry leading navigation and suction, the AquaSense x Ecosystem removes the worst chore associated with robot vacs — cleaning the debris baskets filled with soggy leaves, slime and bugs. The standalone cleaning dock empties debris into a disposable bag in a bin waiting below. Next, it rinses the internal mechanisms with fresh water fed from an attached hose, keeping the filter, debris baskets and vents clear and clean.\n\nThe Luba 3 AWD stole the show at CES 2026, easily climbing slopes up to 80 percent thanks to its four-wheel drive design. This smart mower also offers wire free navigation enhanced by LiDAR and AI vision, plus adjustable cutting heights. This attractive robot lawnmower can also overcome and avoid obstacles in your yard, from tennis balls to rogue hedgehogs.\n\nBirdfy's smart 4K hummingbird feeder has a beautiful, unique design that more closely resembles an actual flower. Most importantly, it captures slow-motion video at 120 frames per second, letting you see the flap of hummingbirds' wings as they flit through your backyard. Using AI and its 8MP camera, the Hum Bloom will identify 150 different species of avian visitors.\n\nSamsung Galazy Z Trifold (Winner)\n\nA vanguard in melding eye-catching design with genuine utility, the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold achieves CES's highest honor, Best Overall. This slim device lives up to the promise of a foldable, full size tablet-phone hybrid that's as functional as it is pocketable. Its futuristic allure and seamless practicality elevate the tech while keeping it within reach.",

    "title": "CES 2026: I Saw a Robot Vacuum With Legs Climb a Flight of Stairs",
    "description": "Finally, a robot vacuum that can climb stairs.",
    "fullText": "Robot vacuums are a convenient way to keep your house clean without actually putting in much work, but they've all got one major problem—what if your house has multiple stories? At CES this year, I saw two attempts to fix this problem, but one of them was much more fabulous than the other.\n\nThis is the more unique of your stair climbing robot vacuums, and the one that's new for this year. At CES 2026, robot vacuum company Roborock introduced the Roborock Saros Rover, which has two fold-out and individually articulated legs built into it, with wheels on either one.\n\nThis lets it act like a standard robot vacuum when it's on flat terrain, but when it hits a pair of stairs, it will use its legs to slowly pull itself up and over them. And because those legs are individually articulated, unlike other solutions, it can clean those stairs while it climbs.\n\nPlus, it can also run through fun programmable routines, like dancing and even hopping. Honestly, it looks a lot more cute than the other bipedal robots I've seen littering this year's CES. Maybe that's because it still serves a concrete purpose.\n\nThe problem? You'll need to get the new model to benefit from the stair climbing, whereas competitors are introducing solutions that work with existing vacuums.\n\nThe Roborock Saros Rover also doesn't have hard pricing or a release date yet, but Roborock assured me it isn't a concept, and will make its way to market eventually. I was told the goal is this year, but the company couldn't confirm that.\n\nNext to Roborock's booth, I also saw another approach to a stair climbing robot vacuum from competitor Dreame. This actually showed up at German tech conference IFA last year, but it's still worth bringing up, if only to highlight how different the Roborock is. Essentially, instead of building a single robot vacuum model with individual legs, Dreame instead built a dock that your existing robot vacuum can drive into, and then the dock will take it up the stairs like a taxi.\n\nThe catch is that, because the dock needs to be able to drive to the stairs, it does not use individually articulated legs to climb, and instead uses treads that move in sync with each other. This gets it up and down stairs with no problem, but unlike Roborock's solution, it's not able to clean while doing so.\n\nHowever, I'll note that I did personally see Dreame's dock go down a flight of stairs, something Roborock's unit didn't do in the demo I watched. Maybe this is a more stable approach.\n\nUnfortunately, while Roborock said it's definitely planning on bringing the Saros Rover to market, Dreame's dock, called the Cyber X, is still just a concept, and may not actually ever make it to consumers.",

    "description": "One controller to rule them all!",
    "fullText": "Gaming controllers are just one of those things that I love to collect, but living in a small New York apartment, eventually enough is enough. At CES this year, I saw three new controllers that are all trying to be the last ones I'll ever need to buy (for specific systems, at least). It seems like modularity is in, and all three of these devices want to meet all of your needs. However, they're not settled on what the best approach is.\n\nThe GameSir x Hyperkin X5 Alteron is probably the cutest controller on this list, especially if you grew up playing GameCube or Nintendo 64. Essentially, it's a telescopic mobile controller that stretches to fit around your phone or small tablet, but the gimmick is that all of the face buttons and sticks come in hot swappable modules, and can be freely mixed-and-matched for multiple configurations.\n\nYou could do a standard Xbox style layout. You could opt for a layout with symmetrical, PlayStation style thumbsticks instead. You could use GameCube or Nintendo 64 style face button configurations, which is a unique touch. There are even options for a six-button arcade style layout or a Steam Deck style trackpad.\n\nEssentially, play your cards right, and this thing could fit any need you might possibly have, so long as you're playing on mobile. You could even get weird and slot in a GameCube layout for your left hand and a Nintendo 64 layout for your right hand.\n\nThe different configurations all pop in and out easily, but don't feel loose when you're using the controller. And there are also bells and whistles like back paddles and trigger stops, for extra buttons and quicker reaction times. The sticks are also capacitive, which essentially means they shouldn't drift, but also won't cause magnetic interference like Hall Effect or TMR sticks (other popular anti-drift technology) can.\n\nThe catch? While this isn't a concept, pricing and availability aren't set in stone yet. GameSir also told me it's still figuring out distribution, so it's unclear how many control modules will come with the controller, if you'll be able to buy them separately, and how much they'll cost if you do. The company did say it's targeting a $100 release, but that could change, and it's still figuring out how to make that a reality.\n\nThe other issue, of course, is that this is mobile only, although GameSir said it might make a more traditional version in the future. This isn't the first controller with hot swappable modules, but others are usually pro-level and don't have nearly as many options as the X5 Alteron does.\n\n8BitDo is one of my favorite controller companies, especially for retro style controllers. Last year, it already dipped its toes into modularity with the 8BitDo Pro 3. That was a PlayStation-style controller that allowed you to individually swap out any of the main four face buttons to place them in whatever order you wanted, which made it easier to swap between Xbox (ABXY) and Nintendo (BAYX) style layouts. Now, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3e is taking that concept and really running with it.\n\nOfficially licensed by Xbox but also compatible with PC and mobile devices, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3e looks like a standard Xbox controller at first, but has a removable face plate that gives you access to a bunch of options. Take it off, and you can lift out the sticks, D-Pad, or face buttons to swap them for ones with a different feel.\n\nYour overall control layout will still be the same—there's no mimicking the GameCube, swapping the order of the ABXY buttons, or changing your stick position here. But you could opt for either a four-way or circular D-Pad or sticks with different lengths or grips, for instance. The ABXY button modules also come in both quiet silicone versions or clicky, micro-switch versions.\n\nThat's a lot of control, and it comes on top of 8BitDo's standard Ultimate controller features, like the included charging dock, extra macro buttons, trigger stops, a gyroscope, and 1,000hz polling.\n\n8BitDo says the Ultimate 3e controller will cost $150 and will come with all your control options. It's set to ship later this year.\n\nWhen I reviewed the MCON magnetic gaming controller late last year, I wanted to love it. It was my favorite product from last CES, but when it came to market, I had a few issues with it that made me feel like it wasn't quite complete. Well, they're still in the prototype phase, but MCON makers OhSnap are now working on two new MCON models that are looking to fix pretty much all of my problems with the original device.\n\nCalled the MCON Slim and the MCON Lite, these versions of the device are much smaller and should be much cheaper than the version that's on the market now, but retain almost all of its features. There are a few compromises to make that happen, but ultimately, they look like moves in the right direction.\n\nFirst, both the MCON Slim and the MCON Lite have manual sliding mechanisms for their controls. That means the controls normally slip tucked away behind your phone, but can be pulled out like an old-school Android keyboard. I actually prefer this. The original MCON instead uses a spring-loaded sliding mechanism, and it's pretty violent, and can send your phone flying if you're not careful.\n\nSecond, when I say these are smaller, I mean it. If the original MCON felt like attaching a MagSafe battery bank to your phone, these feel a lot more like using a MagSafe wallet. I didn't mind the size of the original too much, but it really is impressive how much the new models have slimmed down.\n\nFinally, while pricing isn't finalized yet, MCON told me to expect the new models to be somewhere between 1/3rd to half the price of the current one. That's a huge markdown on the pricey $150 original, even as these fix some of my problems with it.\n\nTo be fair, you do lose out on a little bit here, but not much. The MCON Slim and MCON Lite still have a kickstand mode, and still feature a full set of buttons, but they handle their shoulder buttons and thumbsticks differently. Both the Slim and Lite have \"inline\" shoulder buttons, which means the L1/R1 and L2/R2 buttons are next to each other horizontally rather than stacked. Not a big deal for me, but some people may prefer a console-like layout. The bigger differences come in the thumbsticks.\n\nThe MCON Slim uses 3DS-style circle pads instead of Switch-style thumbsticks, which is how it's able to save so much space. They aren't my favorite, but I've never had any problems making them work. The MCON Lite, then, uses dual-trackpads instead of thumbsticks. That makes it even smaller than the Slim, but I've never had great luck using trackpads for analog style inputs. It could be useful for games that need a mouse, though.\n\nSo, what makes these modular? Well, aside from giving you more model options and carrying forward the removable kickstand mode from the original MCON, part of what allows these models to be so thin is that they use custom backplates designed for certain phones, whereas the original model used a bulkier solution that fits all phones.\n\nThe MCON Slim and MCON Lite are the most conceptual of the devices on this list, but OhSnap assured me that at least one will make its way to market, hopefully this year. Apparently, there are still internal debates about whether the model with trackpads is worth releasing or not.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Ford Is Launching Its Own AI Assistant",
    "description": "Your Ford is getting its own ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Listen up, Ford drivers: You're getting a new AI assistant this year. During a decidedly low-key CES keynote, the company announced Ford AI Assistant, a new AI-powered bot coming to Ford customers in the early half of 2026.\n\nWhile the company has plans to integrate the assistant into Ford vehicles directly, that isn't how you'll first experience this new AI. Instead, Ford is rolling out Ford AI Assistant to an upgraded version of its Ford app first, and plans on shipping cars with the assistant built-in sometime in 2027. In effect, Ford has added a proprietary version of ChatGPT or Gemini to its app.\n\nFord's idea here is to offer users a smart assistant experience directly tied to their Ford vehicle. In one example, the company suggests a customer could visit a hardware store looking to buy mulch. Said customer could take a photo of a pile of bags of mulch, and ask the assistant, \"how many bags can I fit in the bed of my truck?\" Ford AI Assistant could then run the numbers, and offer an educated estimate to how much mulch the customer can buy and take with them at one time.\n\nOf course, other AI assistants can do similar calculations. Send ChatGPT the same photo, and ask the same question—specifying the model of your truck—and the bot will run the numbers itself. The difference, in Ford's view, is that Ford AI Assistant is connected to your vehicle specifically. It can read all the sensors in your car, so it knows, for example, how many people are currently traveling with you, your current tire pressure, or, really, anything and everything about your car. According to Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EVs, digital, and design, the company's goal with the assistant is to offer answers customers can't get from other sources. ChatGPT certainly doesn't have access to your every sensor embedded in your car, so Ford does have the advantage there.\n\nFord didn't go out and build its AI tech by scratch, however. The company tells TechCrunch that Ford AI Assistant is hosted by Google Cloud, and is run using \"off-the-shelf LLMs.\" Still, that likely won't have much of an impact on whether or not customers use this new assistant. Instead, that will come down to how useful they find the AI assistant in the app.\n\nAs someone who rarely uses AI assistants, I'd imagine I'd find little use for it if I owned a Ford. That being said, there are some times when it could genuinely be useful to have external access to your car's information. I could probably eyeball how many bags of mulch would fit in my trunk, but I can't tell you my exact odometer reading without starting up my car. The same goes for my tire pressure: It'd be helpful to know my tire pressure before getting in my car, to know whether I should be headed somewhere I can fill up before going to my destination.\n\nOf course, there's also a privacy discussion to be had here. Modern cars are already privacy nightmares, but there's something a bit unnerving about an AI assistant that knows everything about my car.",

    "fullText": "BBC Sport readers have picked their team of the series for the Ashes.\n\nWe asked you to pick an 11 that included two openers, four middle-order batters or all-rounders, a wicketkeeper and four bowlers.\n\nHere's who made the cut and their series stats.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 629, average: 62.90, centuries: three\n\nNo doubts about this man's selection. Travis Head stepped up to open in the first Test and has dominated from the top of the order. He blazed 123 in Perth, sealed the series victory with 170 in Adelaide and then added 163 in Sydney for good measure.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 273, average: 27.30, centuries: none\n\nBar Head, the other openers in the series have enjoyed modest returns. Zak Crawley was dismissed for a pair in Perth, but made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide.\n\nInnings: eight, runs: 286, average: 57.20, centuries: one\n\nSo frequently a feature of English nightmares, Steve Smith had a relatively quiet series initially, passing fifty once and missing the Adelaide Test with sickness. However, his 138 in Sydney took the game away from England and saw him become the second-highest Ashes run-scorer behind Don Bradman.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 400, average: 44.44, centuries: two\n\nFeast and famine for England's legendary batter. Joe Root finally got to three figures in Australia, making an unbeaten 138 in Brisbane and 160 in Sydney, but only passed 20 on one other occasion in the series.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 438, average: 39.77, centuries: none\n\nA case of what could have been for Harry Brook. The big-hitting batter passed 40 on five occasions in the series, but his highest score was his 84 in Sydney.\n\nInnings: 10, runs: 184, average: 18.40, wickets: 15, average: 25.13\n\nA better series with the ball than with the bat for England's skipper. Ben Stokes was frequently England's most threatening bowler, with his best showing a 5-23 in Perth. He made half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide but his next highest score was 19, and he was dismissed for single figures on six occasions.\n\nInnings: eight, runs: 323, average: 46.14, dismissals: 28\n\nThe default pick for the wicketkeeper position. Alex Carey prospered both behind the stumps and with the bat. After 63 in Brisbane, he had a dream Test at his home ground of Adelaide, hitting 106 and 72 as Australia clinched the series.\n\nMatches: five, wickets: 31, average: 19.93, strike-rate: 29.6; runs: 156\n\nA remarkable series for the left-armer. Mitchell Starc started the series with a bang, taking 10 wickets in Perth as Australia blew England away inside two days. He added 6-75 in the first innings at Brisbane while also contributing crucial half-centuries in both the second and third Tests.\n\nMatches: three, wickets: nine, average: 27.11, strike-rate: 53.33, runs: 102\n\nEngland wanted express pace in Australia and Jofra Archer delivered. While his figures didn't necessarily reflect his contribution in the first two Tests, he took 5-53 in the first innings in Adelaide and added a half-century later in the Test. A side strain saw him withdraw from the series after that match.\n\nMatches: five, wickets: 20, average: 24.95, strike-rate: 47.9\n\nScott Boland's nagging accuracy tormented England throughout the series. Thanks to the absence of Josh Hazlewood, the veteran seamer delivered in spades. He even got to open the batting in the quick-paced Test at Melbourne.\n\nMatches: three, wickets: 18, average: 20.11, strike-rate: 32.4\n\nWhat if he'd played earlier? Josh Tongue was introduced in the third Test in Adelaide and set about adding to his already impressive haul of international wickets. He took 4-70 in the second innings in South Australia and picked up 5-45 as England bowled out Australia for 152 on day one in Melbourne.\n\nEngland beaten to give Australia 4-1 Ashes win\n\nBest player, moment & back spasm - our Ashes awards\n\nEngland futures at risk but Head an all-format star - Ashes player ratings",

    "description": "This is a significant shift in how Android Enterprise operates, and the quiet nature of the rollout is arguably as damaging as the way it is being executed.",
    "fullText": "For anyone landing here after searching for answers as to why you're seeing unsettling Play Protect warnings for safe, compliant apps, read this help article and submit an appeal.\n\nGoogle has a habit of dropping significant changes into unassuming help centre articles, and the subject of this article regarding Device Policy Controller (DPC) allowlisting is no exception.\n\nThe changes, which went live earlier this year, involve a new \"Approved Android Enterprise device policy controllers allowlist.\" It’s a dry title for what is essentially a mandatory \"permission to operate\" for any EMM or custom solution developer in the Android space.\n\nWhile it might look like a routine security tweak on the surface, this move introduces a fundamental layer of gatekeeping to Android Enterprise that has far-reaching consequences for the wider ecosystem, consequences Google appears either to have overlooked or simply decided aren't their problem.\n\nThe premise is simple: Only DPCs verified and approved by Android Enterprise are now permitted during the Android Enterprise provisioning process. If your DPC isn't on the list, the enrolment can fail with a rather ominous message: \"Harmful app blocked\".\n\nOn the surface, Google’s justification appears to be the typical \"security and privacy\" refrain. A DPC holds considerable power over an end-user device and could result in some rather unsavoury predicaments if a user could be convinced to factory reset their device, initiate provisioning, and enrol into a potential attacker's solution... But as is often the case with these top-down mandates, the \"security\" label is being used to justify a level of centralised control that feels increasingly stifling for the ecosystem.\n\nWhat this results in is perhaps the most significant change to how a DPC operates since the introduction of Android Enterprise, in Android Lollipop (5.0).\n\nTo understand the gravity of this, we first have to look at what a DPC actually is.\n\nIn the Android management world, the DPC is the \"agent\" application, the Device Owner that holds the keys to the kingdom. It can communicate with a backend - typically but not always an EMM server - and may enforce policies like Wi-Fi settings, app restrictions, and password requirements directly on the OS.\n\nAt least, in the enterprise ecosystem. More broadly the community has leveraged custom DPCs for turning their applications into native Android kiosks, building community/open source management platforms, expanding solutions out to use cases like parental control, device leasing, and more. Consider Acurast, which uses Device Owner (DO) to put a device into a pool of worldwide resources developers can use for their decentralised computing needs, Xibo which is a DO-supported media client, or FreeKiosk which does what it says on the tin.. amongst many others.\n\nDPCs are used for all sorts of functionality for all sorts of use cases. They can also run entirely locally through hard-coded restrictions/functionality in cases where the whole use case is to showcase the app utilising DPC functionality itself. Historically, Google didn't care whose DPC you used, nor what it did, provided it called the right APIs and didn't outright abuse either the user or the OS. This allowed for a flourishing ecosystem of solutions built upon custom DPCs.\n\nIn parallel to this more recently (well, 2019), Google introduced the Android Management API. This native-feel implementation of a consistent and centralised management platform has been the default and only option for enterprise vendors to build their enterprise management solutions for the last few years, following the deprecation of the Play EMM API. Custom DPCs haven't gone away, though without the Play EMM API there's no app or account management available. This has to go through AMAPI. If you're an enterprise EMM vendor, Play access is a cornerstone of your solution.\n\nAMAPI in turn has become more and more restrictive on who uses it and how; their permissible usage page has grown more complex and limited as time has progressed, most recently completely blocking new vendors from even touching the API without Google's approval of a vendor's business case, and then limiting the number of devices permitted to enrol without continued and repetitive applications for increased quotas. It's becoming quite a restrictive, overly-moderated experience.\n\nAs Google tightens the screws on AMAPI access, the custom DPC route has become a more appealing option. I can speak to several vendors I've worked with previously denied access to AMAPI who have turned to custom DPC, for example. For many use cases access to Google Play for app/account management isn't all that critical and achieves the goals in mind. Google's approval framework might suggest if a vendor can't get approval for AMAPI, they must automatically be doing something untoward, but given the permissible uses are limited and target some of the most popular use cases for restricted access - financing, device as a service (DaaS), and in-house solutions - that suggestion would be plainly wrong.\n\nIn any case, the move to start restricting custom DPCs could have been anticipated, though I'm not sure many (including me) did so. While I agree policing of the custom DPC market is beneficial (I'm sure some fall for the mandate to wipe and enrol their devices into a malicious solution, I've seen worse), the way Google has gone about it leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.\n\nI want to be clear I am in favour of keeping the ecosystem safe. It's what I spend most of my days doing through the very DPCs in question (amongst other things). I'm also not just grumpy about this because it's change; I wrote of my support for developer verification just a few months ago.\n\nOn the face of it, the restrictions aren't unreasonable. Frustrating though they may be in limiting choice and freedom for projects and organisations taking advantage of the Android Enterprise framework, what Google has put in place is fine - it's even slightly less restrictive than the requirements for AMAPI as there's no explicit restriction on in-house solutions. I also can't argue the dev guidance and mobile unwanted software policies for some of the causes of being flagged outside of the allowlist, as it makes perfect sense - SMS, notifications, and accessibility permissions should absolutely be challenged given their sensitive nature, and a DPC should never be anything other than fully transparent with its capabilities and behaviours.\n\nThere are two very distinct issues I take with how this allowlist has come about, however.\n\nIn the aforementioned developer verification announcements, Google provides a year for developers to get on board. There are multiple approaches to verification offered, and generally speaking even those slowest to adapt to change have a justifiable amount of time to figure things out. It's not dissimilar to Play EMM API being deprecated, that's been going on for a few years now with vendors still tip-toeing over to AMAPI. There was an iFrame approval change that was deprecated in 2021, and in 2023 I was still writing about it. Let's not even touch on Device Administrator deprecation..\n\nGoogle made the change earlier this year and no one outside of existing partners would have known until their DPCs were being actively blocked, something demonstrated in the customer community multiple times:\n\nThis lack of communication feels tone-deaf. It ignores the reality of countless developers who have built livelihoods on the open nature of Android, only to be thrown face-first into an arbitrary wall.\n\nGoogle Play Protect was introduced as the world’s most widely deployed mobile threat protection service. Its job is to find malware, identify potentially harmful applications (PHAs), and keep users safe from real threats, but here Google is using Play Protect as the gatekeeper, and by folding the \"Approved DPC\" list into Play Protect’s enforcement engine, Google has turned a tool designed for protection into a weapon of enforcement of Google's will.\n\nThere's obviously a distinction between GPP flagging on sensitive permissions, which is valid and I take no issue with, versus GPP running off an arbitrary list of package names a team within Google has to maintain. The latter is mind-boggling to me.\n\nThe weaponisation of a tool many in the ecosystem have applauded as a beacon of Android security means when a user or an IT admin attempts to enrol a device using a DPC that isn't on Google's allowlist, Play Protect intervenes.\n\nIt doesn't say, \"This vendor hasn't completed their paperwork.\", it displays some of the scariest warnings in the Android lexicon.\n\nThis is a massive erosion of trust. If \"unsafe\" just means \"not a Google approved application,\" my prediction is we will eventually see the messaging for Play Protect soften, lowering the likelihood of taking actual malware warnings seriously. It all starts with an \"oh ignore the warning, just continue\", and authority is lost. Google is crying wolf to protect its ecosystem boundaries, and in doing so, they are devaluing the very security tool they claim is vital for the platform's health.\n\nWith this allowlist, the days of building a custom DPC for anything but what Google considers a justifiable use case are heading towards a reality where this may not be possible. Whether you’re a developer building an open-source management tool, or a company with a bespoke internal DPC for a fleet of industrial devices, you now have to go through an opaque verification process that is down to the interpretation of the human undertaking the approval at the time. If you're building anything else, that human may just not put the package name on the list.\n\nAgain, I'm not against protection for users in the ecosystem. I find it, however, baffling with all the signals Play Protect gets from a device, with all of the ecosystem data Google consumes across billions of Android devices, all of the pattern recognition, user feedback, all of this noise Google has chosen to forego every ounce of technology they use powering Android's industry-leading security.. for a list. Implemented with little to no consideration for the ramifications to businesses and communities.\n\nThe answer is to get verified, because this new reality treats every custom DPC as hostile until you prove otherwise.\n\nIf you're going to navigate it, here are the hoops; steps that shouldn't be unnecessary if Play Protect judged behaviour instead of defaulting to the ban-hammer:\n\nIf you’re blocked mid-provisioning, tell admins and users plainly that the warning is about allowlisting, not malware, and point out the option for them to continue the install if present in the Play Protect warning.\n\nStandardisation is a good thing. I’ve spent years advocating for the Android Management API (AMAPI) and a more consistent experience across OEMs. But standardisation should not be achieved like this.\n\nGoogle needs to decouple technical safety from verification. If an app isn't verified, the OS should tell the user that. It should say: \"This management tool is from an unverified/unknown/unapproved developer. Proceed with caution.\" It should not say: \"This app is trying to bypass security.\" By using the PHA stick to enforce partner rules, Google is signalling that the wider community - the tinkerers, the niche hardware vendors, and the independent developers - are no longer a priority. It’s a move that lacks empathy for the diverse ways Android is used across the world.\n\nThe ship has sailed to put a pause on this now, but it's not too late to put out visible announcements, talk about the security, justify the change, adjust the messaging - everything that was done with developer verification should be done here, too.\n\nTo the developers and vendors struggling with this: My advice is to document everything: Any failed appeal, any poor user experience, and any customer you lose because of a misleading warning. Submit it to the customer community and make sure you're seen and heard. We've made incredible changes through the community over the last few years. Feedback matters.",

    "description": "\"We were sailing at night.\"",
    "fullText": "Thirty killer whales viciously attacked a Dutch family's yacht off Portugal's coast, just several weeks after a similar attack involving orcas.\n\nAccording to the Independent, the incident happened during a trip between Porto and Lisbon when orcas \"violently\" attacked the boat early in the morning and dealt notable damage to the vessel. As the boat filled with water, the family barely managed to reach shore.\n\nNo one was hurt, including the whales, and authorities took the boat in for inspection. Just a few weeks prior, a family with young children suffered a similar attack and was rescued by the Portuguese Air Force at night.\n\nThese attacks follow several others in September, when three orca attacks were reported in a single week. Thirteen people were rescued from the group of boats, one of which sank, according to the Independent.\n\nJuly saw more of the same, with an orca pod attacking two boats in Spain and Portugal and a group of whales charging a separate vessel.\n\nBecause of the frequent events, experts encouraged the public to be vigilant and to know what actions to take if they encounter orcas. Some of the advice included lowering the sails and turning off the boat's engines as well as other loud equipment, such as autopilots and echo sounders.\n\nStaying in shallow water is also advised since it makes it more difficult for orcas to ram boats.\n\nThe strange phenomenon has puzzled scientists and boaters, who believe that the whales are simply egging one another on without any obvious motive behind the boat ramming other than play or exploration. However, as reported by Interesting Engineering, the animals may also engage in aggressive behavior to defend their territory, protect their young, or respond to environmental stressors such as warming oceans and food shortages.\n\n\"Some populations may also develop unusual and temporary behavioural 'fads' and other idiosyncrasies that do not appear to serve any obvious adaptive purpose,\" leading marine biologist Alex Zerbini, chair of the scientific committee at the International Whaling Commission, said last year in a statement, per the Independent.\n\nAlthough some of the orcas' and whales' behaviors may be explained by social adaptations, this remains concerning because it can endanger both them and people. If warming waters caused by the changing climate are to blame, it's important to do what we can to conserve resources and protect their ecosystems from further harm.\n\nIn a Portuguese news outlet Correio da Manhã interview, per the Independent, one of the members of the boating accident said: \"We were sailing at night.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is now on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Moscow as his administration continues to negotiate a deal to end the war that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he met with Trump at the White House earlier Wednesday, during which the president “greenlit” the Russia sanctions bill that has been in the works for months.\n\nGraham had signaled previously that Trump has blessed the bill, only for it to encounter additional obstacles. But a White House official confirmed to The Associated Press Wednesday that the president supports the sanctions legislation.\n\n“This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent,” Graham said in a statement, referring to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe bill, chiefly written by Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., allows the administration to impose tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russia’s oil, gas, uranium and other exports. Doing so is meant to cut off the source of financing for much of Russia’s military actions.\n\nThe White House has previously insisted on some revisions and flexibility for Trump in the sanctions package, but the White House official on Wednesday did not elaborate on whether any changes were secured.\n\nThe legislation has dozens of co-sponsors in the Senate, as well as a companion bill in the House, drafted by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.\n\nGraham said there could be a vote as early as next week, although it’s unclear how likely that will be. The Senate is poised to take up a scaled-back government funding package next week that the House is currently considering, if the House passes it. The following week is a Senate recess timed to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently trying to finalize a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old, with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, as the U.S. president’s chief negotiators.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump touched on canceling the election while also dismissing the prospect in a wide-ranging speech on Jan. 6.\n\nSpeaking to House Republicans at the newly dubbed \"Trump-Kennedy Center,\" he encouraged the lawmakers to campaign on his priorities to keep control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. He expressed confusion about the poor public opinion of his job performance, saying Republicans have the \"right policy.\"\n\nRiffing on tariffs during his speech, he said, \"if you have the wrong president, nothing's good.\"\n\n\"We found that out for four years... They had the worst policy and we have to even run against these people,\" he said. \"I won't say 'cancel the election, they should cancel the election,' because the fake news will say 'he wants the elections canceled, he's a dictator.' They always call me a dictator.\"\n\nTrump vs. the midterm blues: Can he get MAGA voters excited (and voting) in 2026?\n\nRepublicans currently hold the majority in both chambers of Congress, though the House's majority is shrinking with Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's departure and unexpected emergencies with other GOP members.\n\nThe president's party often loses in midterm elections, though Trump in his speech rallied to break that trend. His political future depends on it, he said.\n\n\"You’ve got to win the midterms,” Trump said. “If we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be – they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”\n\nTrump was impeached twice in his first term by House Democrats, and the Senate acquitted him both times.\n\nEvery House Representative and a third of Senators will be up for reelection on Nov. 3, 2026, when various local and state elections will also happen. That means any eligible U.S. citizen could vote in the midterm.\n\nMidterm elections usually see lower voter turnout compared to presidential election years. Though 2018, the midterms in Trump's first term, brought a jump in turnout at 53.4%, according to Census Bureau data. In 2022, the turnout was 52.2%. Compare those to the 2020 presidential election, a record-breaking year, which saw a turnout rate of 66.8%.\n\nOlder voters are more likely to turn out in non-presidential years and also more likely to vote Republican, according to Reuters. White voters and college-educated voters made up a larger portion of voters than nonvoters in the 2018 and 2022 midterms, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Zachary Schermele, USA TODAY\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

    "fullText": "Terry Zink has spent his entire life in the woods.\n\nAs a 57-year-old third generation houndsman from Marion, Montana — a town tucked into the Flathead National Forest — Zink hunts mountain lions and bears while running a small archery target business.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nHe also voted for Trump, but after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) implemented deep cuts to the federal agencies that manage America’s public lands in 2025, Zink is openly second-guessing his vote.\n\n“You won’t meet anyone more conservative than me, and I didn’t vote for this,” Zink told Politico (1). “You cannot fire our firefighters. You cannot fire our trail crews. You have to have selective logging, and water restoration, and healthy forests.”\n\nAcross Montana, the impact is already being felt. Hunters are running into overgrown trails, ranchers are watching as drought resilience and wildfire mitigation funds are frozen, and outfitters and guides — who brought in roughly $314 million to Montana in 2024 — are dealing with staffing cuts that have affected their business.\n\nAnd this isn’t just happening in Montana.\n\nVersions of this scenario are playing out across the west, with real consequences for rural jobs, small businesses and the cost of hunting and fishing on public lands.\n\nSince early 2024, the federal workforce that manages America’s public lands has shrunk by about 20%, dropping from 79,070 employees to 63,141 by September 2025, according to the Center for American Progress (2).\n\nThe cuts have hit these specific agencies the hardest (3):\n\nU.S. Forest Service: Approximately 3,400 jobs cut\n\nNational Park Service: Approximately 1,000 jobs cut\n\nBureau of Land Management: Approximately 800 jobs cut\n\nRoughly 97% of Bureau of Land Management employees work outside of D.C., often in small remote towns where federal agencies are among the biggest employers (4). When ranger stations close or seasonal crews disappear, the economic fallout can spread to local gas stations, restaurants and diners, as well as hotels and motels.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, outdoor recreation generated $1.2 trillion in economic output in 2023, made up 2.3% of U.S. GDP and supported five million jobs (5). States like Montana, Alaska, Vermont and Hawaii rely on outdoor recreation at twice the national average. In Montana alone, the sector pumped $3.4 billion into the state economy in 2023 (6).",

    "fullText": "The U.S. electric vehicle market hasn't taken off as many had predicted.\n\nAfter years of government subsidies and prodding from the companies themselves, 2025 was the year that EV dreams collided with reality.\n\nConsumers flocked to car dealerships in record numbers to buy EVs ahead of the expiration of the $7,500 tax credit in September.\n\n2025 (through September): over 1 million units, 10.5% market share\n\n2024: 1.3 million, 8.1% market share\n\n2023: 1.2 million, 7.8% market share\n\n2022: 800k 5.8%, market share\n\nBut even that buying rush showed some cracks.\n\nU.S. consumers purchased 90 different EV models in the third quarter, but only nine sold more than 10,000 units.\n\nTesla Model Y and Model 3 were top sellers, moving more than 114,000 and 53,000 vehicles, respectively, and the Chevy Equinox sold just under 25,000.\n\nBut those three models were outliers.\n\n“The vast majority of EVs sell at a rate of far less than 2,000 units a month, or 6,000 units a quarter. In the volume-driven business of automotive manufacturing, low volume is the enemy; EV profitability remains a distant dream for nearly every automaker,” according to Cox Automotive.\n\nWith that writing on the wall, original equipment manufacturers such as General Motors have been rethinking their EV strategy.\n\nGeneral Motors says it and other OEMs will lose billions of dollars due to the money it invests in electric vehicles, resulting from changes in government policy.\n\n“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in an 8-K filing in October.\n\nGM is ready to eat billions in charges to rightsize its EV production.\n\nThe company’s board of directors approved third-quarter charges of $1.6 billion in GM North America for a “planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint” that will match consumer demand.\n\nAs a result, General Motors revealed it would lay off more than 1,000 workers at Factory Zero, its all-EV assembly plant located in the Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan area.\n\nGM also shared that it would reduce production at the factory to one shift.\n\nBut its EV production rightsizing didn't end there. On Monday, Jan. 5, workers at the Lordstown, Ohio, plant, where some of GM's EV fuel cells are manufactured, received similar bad news.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump loyalist and Kennedy Center boss Richard Grenell is in meltdown mode after yet another prestigious artist backed out of performing at the once-iconic venue.\n\nGrammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck cited political influence for withdrawing from an upcoming show at the venue, which now has signage calling it “The Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\n“Performing there has become charged and political, at an institution where the focus should be on the music,” Fleck posted on social media on Tuesday before pulling out of three shows with the National Symphony Orchestra due to take place at the venue in February as part of the “American Mosaic” series.\n\n“I look forward to playing with the NSO another time in the future when we can together share and celebrate art,” Fleck added.\n\nThe post appeared to infuriate Grenell, who believes the center is bipartisan and that a “woke mob” is forcing artists to scrap shows at the venue, citing problems with President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\n“You just made it political and caved to the woke mob who wants you to perform for only Lefties,” Grenell posted on X, channelling MAGA talking points.\n\n“This mob pressuring you will never be happy until you only play for Democrats.”\n\nGrenell said the venue welcomes Democrats, Republicans, and also “people uninterested in politics.”\n\n“We want performers who aren’t political,” he said, “who simply love entertaining everyone regardless of who they voted for.”\n\nFleck’s decision follows Wicked composer Stephen Schwartz, who announced this week that he pulled out of appearing at an upcoming Washington National Opera gala at the Kennedy Center in May as it has “now become an ideological statement.”\n\nThe three-time Oscar winner said there was “no way” he would enter the building, which he helped to launch in 1971 with Leonard Bernstein.\n\n“It no longer represents the apolitical place for free artistic expression it was founded to be,” the 77-year-old said. “As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.”\n\nIn retaliation, Grenell claimed on X that the Schwartz reports are “totally bogus” and “he was never signed and I’ve never had a single conversation on him since arriving.”\n\nHowever, the Washington National Opera confirmed to The Washington Post that Schwartz had agreed to host the gala.\n\n“The WNO had an email agreement with him regarding his participation and planning for the event,” Francesca Zambello, artistic director of the WNO, told the Post. “We respect his personal decision.”\n\nTrump’s handpicked board voted on Dec. 18 to add the president’s name to the building, despite having zero legal authority to do so.\n\nSince then, more than 10 artists have pulled out of upcoming performances at the venue, including Fleck and Schwartz.\n\nPreviously, jazz drummer Chuck Redd axed a Christmas Eve show after seeing the name change on the venue’s website while jazz group The Cookers pulled out of two New Year’s Eve shows, an annual tradition since 2006.\n\nThe Cookers’ former tenor saxophonist, Billy Harper, posted on Facebook, “I would never even consider performing in a venue bearing a name (and being controlled by the kind of board) that represents overt racism and deliberate destruction of African American music and culture.”\n\nComedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, The Brentano Quartet with violist Hsin-Yun Huang, folk duo Magpie, and Doug Varone and Dancers have all declined to play at the venue due to its links to the Trump administration.\n\nLee said of her decision, “I won’t lie to you, canceling shows hurts. This is how I keep the lights on. But losing my integrity would cost me more than any paycheck.”\n\nA production of Hamilton has also been pulled from a scheduled March and April run at the Kennedy Center, while musicians Ben Folds and Renée Fleming also stepped down from their advisory roles at the venue.",

The risk of harassment or wrongful detention, arbitrary enforcement of local laws and the possibility of terrorism were also cited.\n\nAmericans who are in Russia are advised to leave immediately.\n\n“The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow.

All U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services,” the State Department said in its warning.\n\nViolence is a continual threat in the country, officials warned.\n\nThere have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg and other large cities and, in 2024, ISIS Khorasan claimed responsibility for an attack at Crocus Music Hall in Moscow that killed 130 people. Places of worship have also been targeted.\n\nU.S. citizens could also become victims of harassment, mistreatment and extortion.\n\n“Russian officials have questioned, threatened, and detained U.S. citizens without reason. This includes both former and current U.S. government and military personnel, as well as private U.S. citizens. Russian authorities have a history of wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals and using them as bargaining chips,” the State Department warned.\n\nOther counties on the State Department’s “Do Not Travel” list include Afghanistan, Belarus, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Niger, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Ukraine.\n\nIf you must travel to Russia, the State Department has a list of safety precautions.

    "description": "If true, the claim could significantly reshape the global bitcoin market.",
    "fullText": "When Bitcoin first launched in 2009, many investors dismissed the currency as a fringe concept and even as a scam. (Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s former right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, memorably called it “stupid and evil.”) But the asset has skyrocketed in value in recent years and President Donald Trump labeled the currency “digital gold” after signing an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last January. Now, reports allege that Venezuela has bought into that “digital gold,” holding a “shadow reserve” nearly double that of the U.S.\n\nDigital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold an estimated $60 billion worth of Bitcoin. Additional intelligence reports allege that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his associates accrued Bitcoin via three channels: a gold swap overseen by Venezuelan Interior Minister Alex Saab in 2018, oil revenue priced in Bitcoin, and by seizing crypto mining equipment from miners in the country.\n\nSanctions have walled off the country’s access to financial markets for years, and experts allege that they may have motivated Venezuelan leaders to invest in cryptocurrencies to sidestep the barrier.\n\nBitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela’s holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth nearly $22 million. The website sourced the data from a 2022 Forbes article that cited research from a blockchain analytics firm. The total is a far cry from the estimated U.S. holdings of 328,372, currently worth $30 billion, though the claim positions Venezuela’s holdings at nearly double the U.S. and one of the biggest holders of bitcoin globally.\n\nThe claims of Venezuela’s shadow Bitcoin holdings have predictably garnered skeptics, including digital asset financial services company Ledn Co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, who grew up in Venezuela and whose family has mined crypto there since 2014.\n\nDi Bartolomeo finds no credibility in any of the three alleged sources of bitcoin income: the gold swap, oil exchange or mining equipment seizures. “This to me does not align with anything in the public record,” di Bartolomeo told Fortune. “There’s so much corruption, embezzlement and missing money that I don’t believe that any meaningful amount would have accrued.”\n\nHe outlined his full argument in a Coindesk op-ed piece titled “Don’t hold your breath for Venezuela’s bitcoin.” Though he notes that his family’s crypto mining materials were seized by the government in 2018 and returned five years later in a worn down condition, signaling heavy use of the equipment.",

He's warning both the Ravens - and the rest of the league - that they will be making a big mistake if they don't hire him. President Trump is a major fan of the Super Bowl-winning head coach.\n\nWhile some have told political figures to stay out of sports, President Trump is very much making his presence felt. The President of the United States is expected to pressure NFL teams into hiring John Harbaugh. President Trump has a close relationship with many prominent NFL owners.\n\nPresident Trump issued his official \"warning\" to the 32 NFL franchises on social media this week, following Harbaugh's firing.\n\n\"HIRE JOHN HARBAUGH, FAST,\" Trump warned. \"HE AND HIS BROTHER, ARE TOTAL WINNERS!!!\"\n\nJohn Harbaugh has previously shown love for President Trump and the White House.\n\nHarbaugh, who led the Ravens to a Super Bowl win in 2013, visited the White House over the summer.\n\n\"How you framed that question — I would have framed that question like: 'You got a chance to go visit with the president, man. What was that experience like?'\" Harbaugh said in response to a reporter asking him about visiting with President Trump, who had been critical of Baltimore.\n\n\"It was amazing. It was awesome. And I promise you I root for our president. I want our president to be successful just like I want my quarterback to be successful and I want my team to be successful, and it was an amazing experience.\"\n\nHis brother, Jim Harbaugh, has met more U.S. Presidents.\n\n\"He's got seven, I got four. I had a chance to meet President Obama twice — incredible experience. Had a chance to meet President Biden when he was vice president in Iraq, and spent a lot of time with him in Iraq,\" he said. \"Jim got invited also to the White House to meet President Reagan because he was a Heisman Trophy candidate.

    "description": "Wealthy travelers may have rented Combs’ jet without realizing its connection.",
    "fullText": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs reportedly made millions from unsuspecting ultra-wealthy travelers prior to his trial for sex trafficking and racketeering charges.\n\nAccording to The U.S. Sun, Silver Air was renting out Combs' $60 million private jet following Combs' arrest on Manhattan's Upper East Side in September 2024.\n\nBetween then and May 2025, Combs' 14-seat aircraft was rented out at least every other day, raking in approximately $4.1 million in 126 trips as Combs' other income streams dried up.\n\nIn October, a federal court convicted the former rapper and music executive on two counts of transporting people for prostitution and sentenced him to 50 months in prison, per NBC News.\n\nBroker site Jettly explained how wealthy travelers may have rented Combs' jet without realizing its connection to the Bad Boy Records founder.\n\n\"Brokers are the intermediaries between your licensed aircraft and passengers,\" Jettly wrote. \"The listing process is usually straightforward, and once vetted by the platform, the plane will appear as available and will soon start generating income.\"\n\n\"This is most likely what happened with Diddy's Gulfstream G550. The plane was listed, and the passengers didn't even know who the real owner was.\"\n\nIn September 2024, Yahoo reported that Combs' defense team said in court he was attempting to sell the jet; it's unclear if he and his representation have since decided that renting is more profitable, but without disclosing who the owner is, the practice may draw increasing scrutiny.\n\nIn the aviation world, Gulfstream G550 jets are known for offering a luxurious and comfortable travel experience, with \"whisper-quiet cabins,\" \"advanced communication and entertainment systems,\" and \"a range of up to 6,750 nautical miles,\" according to charter broker Blade.\n\n\"It's no wonder it was in high demand,\" Jettly wrote.\n\nWould you trust a wingless jet on a cross-country flight?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nYet private jet travel comes with a cost beyond the reported $32,597 per journey Combs' jet brought in.\n\nMany private flights are shockingly short yet punch far above their weight when it comes to their harmful environmental impact. A private jet produces up to 14 times more air pollution per passenger than a commercial plane, according to estimates from Transport & Environment.\n\nWhile electric taxi services and alternative fuels could provide a more sustainable commute through the air, jet kerosene still powers most flights. Modes of transportation like high-speed rail — which also avoid traffic congestion — are undoubtedly cleaner per person.\n\nAs for Combs' rented jet, registered to LoveAir LLC, it burned through 136,665 gallons of fuel and released approximately 1,885 tons of carbon pollution across 126 flights, per The Sun.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "GOP Sen. Thom Tillis had strong criticism for Stephen Miller Wednesday, going as far as to suggest the senior White House adviser’s job should be at risk for his recent comments on US control of Greenland.",
    "fullText": "GOP Sen. Thom Tillis had strong criticism for Stephen Miller Wednesday, going as far as to suggest the senior White House adviser’s job should be at risk for his recent comments on US control of Greenland.\n\n“Look either Stephen Miller needs to get into a lane where he knows what he’s talking about or get out of this job,” Tillis told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead.”\n\nThe comments from retiring North Carolina senator mark some of the strongest yet from a Republican lawmaker following the White House deputy chief of staff’s assertion that the US has the right to take Greenland.\n\nTillis, who has served as the top Republican on the bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group since 2018, cautioned that Miller’s posturing has significant political implications.\n\nCalling the NATO alliance “critically important,” he told Tapper that “shaking that alliance sends a signal to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin that he’s winning.”\n\n“And Stephen Miller doesn’t represent the US government, he represents the Article II branch. And I, as a member of the US Senate, get to weigh in to this issue,” he continued. “And I know, whether they say it out loud or not, most of my colleagues agree with me.”\n\nPressed on why more Republicans aren’t speaking out, Tillis said, “Well in this case it’s pretty straightforward. That’s my role as the Republican leader of the Senate NATO Observer Group.”\n\n“It’s very important for the NATO alliance to know that we have their back because they’ve had ours.”\n\n“We need to make it very clear that our strength and our ability to project power to stand off against Putin, to stand off Russia, to stand off China, Iran, it all rests on this exquisite capability that we have under NATO,” he said.\n\nThe remarks came just hours after Tillis delivered a searing speech on the Senate floor.\n\n“I’m sick of stupid,” a fiery Tillis declared in the Senate. “I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy. And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOn Monday, Miller asserted during an interview with Tapper that the formal position of the Trump administration is that “Greenland should be part of the United States.”\n\nMiller also questioned Denmark’s claim over the Arctic territory. “What is the basis of their territorial claim? What is their basis of having Greenland as a colony of Denmark?” he said.\n\nTillis told Tapper that Miller’s CNN interview was “horrible execution” on “a subject matter he knows nothing about.”\n\n“What I saw in your interview was unacceptable,” Tillis said, adding, “And it made me a little cranky.”\n\nEarlier, he told his colleagues that Miller’s comments were “absurd.”\n\n“Mr. Miller said that the US government – obviously Greenland should be part of the US. That is absurd,” he said.\n\nTillis also warned that Miller’s comments distracted from the Trump administration’s military operation in Venezuela.\n\n“What makes me cranky? Stupid. What makes me cranky is when people don’t do their homework. What makes me cranky is when we tarnish the extraordinary execution of a mission I fully support in Venezuela by turning around and making insane comments about how it is our right to have territory owned by the Kingdom of Denmark,” Tillis said.\n\n“Folks, amateur hour is over. You don’t speak on behalf of this US senator or the Congress,” he continued.\n\nThe North Carolina senator emphasized in his floor remarks the value of the NATO alliance, and Denmark’s role in it. He pointed out Denmark’s “disproportionately high” contribution to the NATO response after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US, noting that they lost 43 soldiers in Afghanistan, out of a national population of 6 million.\n\n“You want to get me back to thanking the president for all the good things he’s doing? Then give him good advice,” said Tillis.\n\nTillis had earlier issued a joint statement with the top Democrat on the Senate NATO Observer Group and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, criticizing the administration’s approach to Greenland.\n\n“When Denmark and Greenland make it clear that Greenland is not for sale, the United States must honor its treaty obligations and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” the co-chairs said. “Any suggestion that our nation would subject a fellow NATO ally to coercion or external pressure undermines the very principles of self-determination that our Alliance exists to defend.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Kit Maher contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Darren Fletcher will remain in charge of Manchester United for their FA Cup match against Brighton - as the club battle problems that go far deeper than sorting out managerial uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Darren Fletcher has confirmed he will remain as Manchester United's interim coach for the FA Cup third-round tie with Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday.\n\nHowever, if there is one reality reinforced by United's 2-2 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor, it is that whatever issues there are at Old Trafford, they will not be solved merely be switching the man in the dugout.\n\n\"They have informed me they would like me to take the team on Sunday,\" said Fletcher.\n\n\"There was a feeling that might be the case on Monday, but we wanted to focused on Burnley. I am tasked with leading the team on Sunday, so all my focus and energy goes on that now.\"\n\n'They' are United chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.\n\nAs the final whistle sounded, the TV cameras panned to the directors' box and picked the pair out.\n\nThey looked absolutely freezing, which was not a surprise as it was a perishing January night in Lancashire.\n\nBut they also seemed to have plenty on their minds as they stood silently.\n\nThat was not a surprise either after the latest in a succession of frustrating performances.\n\nSince the beginning of November, United have played 10 matches against the teams currently in the bottom eight of the Premier League. They have won two of them.\n\nTheir past three matches have all been against teams either mired in the relegation zone, in the cases of Wolves and Burnley, or trying desperately to stay out of it, such as Leeds. Their return is three draws.\n\nAnd old problems remain, despite axing Ruben Amorim in the wake of Sunday's 1-1 draw at Elland Road and, specifically, the emotional outburst that followed. Those problems remain despite Fletcher immediately moving away from the Portuguese coach's 3-4-3 set-up in favour of a back four.\n\nIn successive away matches at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in November, United led, fell behind and had to fight back for a 2-2 draw.\n\nThis was the other way round - as they fell behind and fought back to lead thanks to Benjamin Sesko's first double since his £73.7m move from RB Leipzig in the summer, only to concede a second goal in a match they dominated.\n\nUnited have still only kept two clean sheets all season. Fletcher accepts it is not good enough.\n\n\"I think it has been proved over the season they [we] give up goals too easily,\" said the former United and Scotland midfielder.\n\n\"There is a tactical element when you change to a back five as there is more space to cover but we defend as a full team.\n\n\"As a team we need to improve in defending and not concede so many goals.\"\n\nThe secondary element is United do not take enough of their chances.\n\nIt is a reality that Amorim's goals-per-game ratio - 1.4 - was the second-worst of any United boss in the Premier League era, with only Ralf Rangnick below him.\n\nIf there is a positive, it is that Fletcher exceeded that figure in his first game in charge. The disappointment comes from the knowledge his side scored two goals from 30 shots, 10 of which were on target.\n\nTwice, Burnley cleared goal-bound efforts off the line. Sesko wasted a couple of opportunities to complete his hat-trick and Lisandro Martinez had a goal disallowed for a push on former Manchester City defender Kyle Walker.\n\n\"I am not sure why,\" grumbled Fletcher. \"We should win the match.\"\n\nBrighton represent the first hurdle in United's last remaining quest to win silverware this season.\n\nWhoever gets the job, their immediate task will not be an easy one. United's next two Premier League games are at home to Manchester City and away at Arsenal.\n\nNot that the evening was entirely without positives.\n\nSesko had not scored since October and had just two goals to his name from almost five months as a United player. Now he has four after a pair of clinical first-time finishes to passes from Bruno Fernandes and Patrick Dorgu.\n\n\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him videos of his movement and how opportunities are going to come,\" said Fletcher.\n\n\"It is just a case of keep believing and making runs. Hopefully they start flooding in from now. It was a real positive night for him.\"\n\nAmorim did give the England Under-20 international his debut with a single appearance from the bench but repeatedly refused to use him despite depressing results.\n\nA six-minute cameo at Turf Moor showed the folly of that decision.\n\nOn his first attacking raid, Lacey cut in from the right wing as he likes to do and curled a beautiful effort at the home goal, which crashed off the bar.\n\nWith United's final attack, he took aim again. For a brief moment, his long-range shot looked to be going in before it floated agonisingly wide.\n\nFrom Fletcher's assessment, it is fair to assume it is not the last we have seen of him.\n\n\"I said to him stay wide on the right and go and do what you do,\" said Fletcher.\n\n\"I know he is going to make an impact. He is creative, has goals in his, is exciting, direct, fearless.\n\n\"I am really pleased with him because he had a really bright game. We know the talent he has got.\n\n\"He will be a big part of Manchester United's future, I have no doubts about that.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns are one of the most pleasant surprises of the NBA season thus far, and many are begging the question of whether or not buying at the deadline is worth breaking up some of the best team chemistry in the league.\n\nWhile the Suns might not necessarily be looking to make moves this deadline, some opposing franchises are attracted by the assets they have.\n\nAccoring to national NBA insider and reporter for Clutch Points Brett Siegel, the Milwaukee Bucks have their eyes on injured star Suns guard Jalen Green.\n\n\"Suns guard Jalen Green is among the many players the Bucks have recently discussed as a potential trade option, league sources told ClutchPoints,\" Siegel said. \"However, the Suns have made it clear Green is not available.\"\n\nGreen has only played in two games this season dealing with multiple injuries. In his only full game with the Suns, he erupted for 29 points, giving Phoenix's fans and executives hope for his fit alongside Devin Booker, who is one of the most doubled guards in the league.\n\nMORE: Dillon Brooks reacts to Suns owner shooting down idea of trading him\n\nGreen has played in just two games for Phoenix this season, remaining out since early November with a right hamstring strain. In his first and only full game with the Suns, he erupted for 29 points on 6-for-13 on 3-pointers and 4-for-7 on 2-pointers in a 115-102 win against the Los Angeles Clippers. He exited the next game after playing just six minutes.\n\nThe former Houston Rockets guard was the key figure in Phoenix's offseason trade that sent Kevin Durant to the Rockets for Green, Brooks and the draft picks that turned into Khaman Maluach, Rasheer Fleming and Koby Brea.\n\nWhile Green hasn't been able to see the floor, Brooks has risen as a prominent offensive staple in the Suns' otherwise lackluster scoring attack, what with Green, a scoring force in his own right, missing all but two games this season.\n\nTrade Proposal sends Nets Michael Porter Jr to Eastern Conference powerhouse\n\nKnicks cut ties with Jalen Brunson's 6-foot-8 teammate after less than two seasons\n\nKevin Love explains why LeBron James is the 'smartest player' he ever played with\n\nLakers’ JJ Redick details how he optimizes LeBron James at his old age",

    "description": "New Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior was optimistic when arriving, but Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Fulham underlines the scale of the task ahead.",
    "fullText": "New Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior arrived with optimism, but Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Fulham underlined the scale of the task ahead.\n\nThe 41-year-old described his appointment as \"one of the proudest moments of his life\", yet the reality was clear as Chelsea dropped out of the Premier League top five for the first time since August.\n\nSitting in the directors' box alongside co-owner Behdad Eghbali and members of the sporting leadership team, Rosenior watched as the side he has inherited slipped to eighth.\n\nHe replaced Enzo Maresca after the Italian fell out with the Blues hierarchy, with Rosenior joining from French club Strasbourg who share Chelsea's owners.\n\nThose decision-makers were targeted by chants from the away end during the match at Fulham, while the Chelsea players struggled against their west London rivals on the pitch.\n\nChelsea have won just one of their past nine league games and two of 11 in all competitions, falling from potential title contenders in November to a side now lagging far behind.\n\nThey have ground to make up to achieve their minimum aim this season – qualifying for the Champions League, which should be achievable with a top-five finish.\n\nBBC Sport looks at the problems Rosenior faces on and off the pitch.\n\nListen: Football Daily - The Debrief\n\nIf Chelsea's relationship with the fans isn't broken, it is certainly fraying.\n\nJust hours after Rosenior was confirmed in his new post, the Chelsea Supporters' Trust released a highly critical survey - not aimed at the appointment, but at the club's leadership.\n\nAmong the headlines was that more than half of respondents doubt Chelsea will achieve success in the next three to five years under the current regime. A similar proportion lack confidence in the ownership's decision-making.\n\nRosenior seemed aware of the stakes. In his first interview with the club's media channels, he used the word 'win' 14 times - a clear signal that he understands the only way to repair this fractured relationship is through results.\n\nThe former Fulham defender also referenced playing against Didier Drogba, Arjen Robben, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and Michael Essien - acknowledging the fear factor Chelsea once commanded during the Roman Abramovich ownership era. These were savvy remarks from the London-born coach, showing he understands the club's identity.\n\nYet even he may not grasp the depth of anger that exists among the fanbase. On Wednesday, chants in support of the sanctioned Russian oligarch who transformed Chelsea rang out across Stamford Bridge, alongside unsavoury songs aimed at co-controlling owner Eghbali and Clearlake Capital.\n\nThere will also be a protest before Rosenior's first league match against Brentford, who leapfrogged them in the table on Wednesday, on Saturday week.\n\nRosenior must know he could become a target himself if results do not come quickly. He embodies everything Todd Boehly and Clearlake believe in: he is young, progressive, and connected to their multi-club model via Strasbourg.\n\nSigning off his first interview, Rosenior said: \"Believe in what is an amazing football club, believe in the players, and when you give energy to the team, you help them win. That's why we are here. I can't wait to meet them and do that soon.\"\n\nChelsea have spent more than £1.5bn on new players since 2022. Although they have raised over £750m through player sales, results have not matched the scale of investment.\n\nMuch of the criticism has focused on the club assembling the youngest squad in the Premier League, with an average starting XI aged under 24. No team that young has ever won the title in the Premier League era.\n\nChelsea have shown flashes of quality but often lose control and drop points. Former boss Maresca highlighted the issue after his side dropped a league-high 15 points from winning positions this season.\n\nRosenior faces similar concerns. His Strasbourg team, with an average age of around 21, dropped 13 points from winning positions and won only two of their past 10 Ligue 1 matches.\n\nInsiders at Chelsea insist they want to be Champions League regulars and eventually challenge for the biggest titles. Yet to achieve even their minimum aims, Chelsea and Rosenior need to find momentum quickly.\n\nChelsea were reduced to 10 men at Fulham when Marc Cucurella was sent off for pulling back Harry Wilson as he broke through on goal.\n\nWilson later scored the winner with a fine finish in the 82nd minute.\n\nCaretaker manager Calum McFarlane defended Cucurella by saying: \"There's been a lot made of the red cards this season. I don't think this one is ill-disciplined. This is football. You get caught one-v-one and Marc is one of the best defenders in the world.\"\n\nHowever, McFarlane admitted concern over three yellow cards that followed immediately for dissent after the dismissal, shown to Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Tosin Adarabioyo.\n\n\"The three yellow cards directly after is something we'll have to look at, but I would argue that we don't want that to happen,\" McFarlane said.\n\nMcFarlane was also later cautioned for questioning the referee.\n\nSince the start of the 2023-24 season, Chelsea have received 251 yellow cards and 11 reds – the most of any Premier League club. They have had five red cards for players in the league this season, and one \n\nFormer boss Maresca had been trying to address the issue before his departure.\n\n'A moving moment' as Rosenior breaks barriers\n\n'It means the world to me' - Chelsea appoint Rosenior\n\nWilson downs Chelsea in front of new boss Rosenior\n\nRosenior joined team meetings before the Fulham match and travelled with the squad to Craven Cottage.\n\nHis first full training session is scheduled for Thursday. He will then be presented to the media on Friday before selecting his first team for Saturday's FA Cup third-round game at Charlton Athletic.\n\nIn the following week, Chelsea face Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-final, followed by Rosenior's first Premier League match at home to Brentford.\n\nThe Debrief: Semenyo leaves Bournemouth in style, Newcastle score the latest-ever winner and six other PL games\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "The Wasatch Mountain Range of the Greater Rockies will serve as the backdrop for the 2027 NHL Winter Classic. University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium will be the site of the league's signature regular-season event, which the Utah Mammoth will host in the franchise's third season.\n\nThe Mammoth will welcome the Colorado Avalanche in a college football venue that seats approximately 51,400 on a fall Saturday in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe date of the game has yet to be finalized, but NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Mammoth owners Ryan and Ashley Smith revealed the matchup Wednesday, along with Mammoth center Logan Cooley.\n\nLogan Cooley on getting to play in the 2027 Winter Classic at Rice-Eccles Stadium: pic.twitter.com/SduTSBg5ah\n\n— Jenna Fink (@jennamfink) January 7, 2026\n\nThe Mammoth, who formed after the Arizona Coyotes were dissolved in April 2024, are currently in their second season.\n\nAfter an 8-2 start to the season, they're now 20-20-3 and in fourth place of the Central Division with 43 points.\n\nThis season, the Mammoth still have one more head-to-head meeting versus the Avalanche, who are the division leaders with a 31-4-7 record. Colorado is also atop the Western Conference at the moment with 69 points.\n\nThe Mammoth and Avalanche have met six times over the past two seasons, with Colorado holding a five-point advantage over Utah in the series. Their lone remaining matchup during the 2025-26 season is on Feb. 25 in Utah.\n\nNext season's Winter Classic will mark the Avalanche's fourth appearance in an outdoor game. Utah, on the other hand, will soon become the 32nd NHL franchise to play in an outdoor game.\n\nThe Classic started as an annual tradition on Jan. 1, 2008. At the time, the Buffalo Sabres played the Pittsburgh Penguins at what was then known as Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, home of the NFL's Buffalo Bills.\n\nThis year's Winter Classic was held Jan. 2 at the Miami Marlins' loanDepot Park. The New York Rangers defeated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers 5-1.\n\nIt was the fifth straight Classic at a baseball stadium.\n\nThat streak will end next season in Salt Lake City, where the University of Utah's campus will take center stage, as Rice-Eccles becomes the fourth college football stadium to host the event.\n\nNotably, Rice-Eccles also put on the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics. It's scheduled to fulfill the same role when the Games return to Utah in 2034.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have smashed preseason expectations in head coach Mike Vrabel’s first year.\n\nThey secured the AFC’s No. 2 seed and will host the Los Angeles Chargers at Gillette Stadium in the Wildcard round on Sunday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it will be second-year quarterback Drake Maye’s NFL postseason debut. But it will be far from Maye’s first truly meaningful game.\n\nIn 2022, the then-20-year-old quarterback squared off with the college football juggernauts that are the Clemson Tigers in the ACC Conference Championship game.\n\nIt was Maye’s sophomore year at the University of North Carolina, and he had brought the Tar Heels to a 9-3 record and a top-25 ranking.\n\nMaye was asked during his Wednesday afternoon press conference what he learned from that experience.\n\n“Maybe a little bit,” Maye said when asked if that college experience correlates to his NFL playoff debut. “Getting back to trying to play for championships… I think it’s a little bit different in the NFL.\n\n“Just the mentality of ‘win or go home’ or ‘win and advance,’ and I think that’s the biggest thing that’s different. In the ACC Championship, you go to a bowl game. Here it’s (win) now, or you’re going home.”\n\nMaye was unable to win the conference championship in 2022, and, as he alluded to, earned a second chance in a game against Bo Nix’s 15th-ranked Oregon Ducks.\n\nMaye threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns in the 2022 Holiday Bowl. He led his team to a 24-10 fourth-quarter lead and added three points on his final drive of the game.\n\nThe defense was unable to stop the Ducks’ two-minute drill as Nix threw the game-winning touchdown with 19 seconds on the clock and beat the Tar Heels 28-27.\n\nDrake Maye Silences Emerging Narrative About Patriots-Chargers Matchup",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Jets hold the second overall pick in the upcoming 2026 NFL draft after finishing 3-14 on the season.\n\nWith news surfacing last season that New York is likely to part ways with Justin Fields and the injuries and inconsistency from backup quarterbacks Tyrod Taylor and Brady Cook, it is expected that the Jets will look to draft a quarterback they believe is fit to lead the franchise.\n\nOregon quarterback Dante Moore is currently projected to be selected by New York in April, behind Indiana's Heisman winner, Fernando Mendoza, who will face off in the College Football Playoff semifinal on Friday for a chance at a national championship.\n\nMore: We now know where New York Jets' first-round pick will land in 2026 NFL draft\n\nESPN's Stephen A. Smith believes Moore should take his chances at Oregon by returning to the Ducks next season instead of declaring for the draft.\n\nSmith and the rest of his colleagues were debating the topic on ESPN's flagship sports talk show, 'First Take', and, as usual, Smith had no problem expressing his opinions on what he believes Moore should do after this season.\n\n\"I'd go back to college before I play for the Jets. They are a football atrocity. They are awful,\" Smith bluntly expressed.\n\nRegardless of whether you agree with the notable sports journalist or not, Smith has a point about not wanting the sophomore to trade in the green and yellow for green and white; the Jets have been bad, to say the least, for a long time and have not made a playoff appearance in nearly two decades.\n\nIt will be Moore's decision when it's all set and done, but Smith made it clear what he believes is the best option for the young slinger's career.\n\nJets make NFL history as first team to end season without an interception\n\nAaron Glenn, Jets facing brutal reality on future of franchise amid 2025 disaster\n\nThe Jets should dump Aaron Glenn, hire former Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski\n\nJets' struggles have a writer from The Ringer wishing Breece Hall leaves in free agency\n\nJets give team MVP to special teamer who was cut in Week 4",

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs will have an excellent opportunity to revamp their roster during the 2026 NFL Draft, starting with the No. 9 pick in the Annual Selection Meeting's first round.\n\nIt has been nearly a decade since Kansas City has picked in the top-10, and with plenty of needs to fill in the coming offseason, Chiefs general manager Brett Veach will need to be judicious with his selections to get his team back into the playoffs.\n\nTake a look at this seven-round mock draft, which projects that Kansas City's front office will target offensive skill positions before addressing its defensive needs:\n\nThe Chiefs waste no time finding an exciting playmaker to help Patrick Mahomes. Tate will be one of the first pass-catchers off the board, and could be exactly the kind of dynamic route-runner that Kansas City needs to reinvent its air attack.\n\nJohnson would immediately be able to take over as the Chiefs' leading rusher to bring some 'juice' to the ground game that Kansas City has sorely missed in the past few seasons.\n\nThis might not be the most exciting pick, but Orange — nicknamed 'Big Citrus' — is exactly the kind of run-stuffer that the Chiefs need in the middle of their defensive line.\n\nKansas City selected Nohl Williams out of Cal last year, and takes Masses here in the fourth round to add another former Golden Bear ball-hawk on Day 3.\n\nGiven that the Chiefs ended the season with their third-string quarterback under center, it seems logical that Kansas City might decide to invest a pick at the position this year. Allar was once considered one of the most exciting quarterback prospects in college football, and joins the Chiefs in Round 5 to become Patrick Mahomes' long-term understudy.\n\nAfter addressing wide receiver and running back early, Kansas City targets Gyllenborg to round out its selections of offensive skill position players.\n\nTapp tallied 12 tackles for loss and 7.5 sacks in 2025 and joins the Chiefs as a developmental prospect who could potentially help bolster the edges of Kansas City's defensive line.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL Draft: Chiefs take WR, RB early in this seven round mock",

    "fullText": "Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre said Wednesday that anyone who says he has thrown in the towel on his battle with Parkinson's disease is spreading fake news.\n\n\"Thank you everyone for your prayers and concerns, but contrary to reports, I have not given up hope in my battle with Parkinson’s!\" the 56-year-old Super Bowl champion wrote on X. \"Not sure where this came from — but just like I never gave up on the gridiron — not going to start now. I pray there will be a cure one day and I appreciate you all.\"\n\nFavre also told TMZ on Wednesday: \"I have absolutely not given up and I am fighting till the end. Yes I have progressed a little faster than I would have hoped at this point but I’m extremely thankful and blessed!!!\"\n\nThe former Packers/Jets/Vikings quarterback revealed his Parkinson's diagnosis last year but hadn't gone into much detail about it until last week's episode of his \"4th and Favre\" podcast.\n\nOn the podcast, Favre sounds like he's trying to be realistic about his condition while also remaining hopeful.\n\n“As you well know, there’s no cure,\" Favre said. \"I hear from time to time, ‘Well, they’re five years away from a cure.’ You know, I hope that that’s the case. I really do. But I’m not holding my breath.\"\n\nHe mentioned Michael J. Fox and Muhammad Ali as people who \"have really set the bar high on Parkinson’s and treatments and things of that nature.\"\n\n\"And I’m sure that when they were diagnosed, they thought, ‘Well, they’ll have a cure in five years. I’ll be fine,’\" Favre said. \"Well, that’s not the case. So, I’m optimistic, but again, I’m not holding my breath.”\n\nFavre's comments on Wednesday may have been in response to a recent online article that seemed to interpret his podcast remarks in a different way than he intended.\n\nAlso on the podcast, Favre said he's in the early stages of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which is the most common type of the disorder. He said his major symptoms are \"rigidity and stiffness,\" which is worst in the morning before he takes his medication and has particularly affected his right side.\n\nFavre added that he occasionally experiences shaking but has not had any memory loss issues.\n\n“All in all, I’m pretty good,\" he said. \"I would say I’ve progressed maybe a little. ... If you dropped a dime on the floor in front of me and I reached down with my right hand, I may for five minutes try to pick up that dime and eventually just grab it with my left hand. Initially when I would take the medicine, my dexterity in my right hand was pretty smooth. But that’s not the case anymore.\n\n“So that’s one of the reasons I think I may have progressed a little bit. Hopefully not. Maybe it’s I’m looking into something more than it really is, but all in all, again I’m very blessed and thankful.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles Kings center and captain Anže Kopitar will retire at the end of the 2025-26 season and like many retirees he’ll be devoting his time to a different passion: golf.\n\nKopitar is the newest investor and limited partner in the Los Angeles Golf Club, one of five teams in the TGL golf league, a newly formed team golf league in its second season that hosts matches inside an arena and features a fusion of virtual courses and high-tech, rotating greens that aims to attract a new generation of golfing fans and provide an innovative arena experience.\n\n“Myself being a pretty passionate golfer and really loving the game, following stuff and seeing the TGL getting some traction and how fun it was to watch, I didn't really think about getting the opportunity, but when the opportunity presents itself, I just kind of jumped on it,” Kopitar said.\n\nThe Kings captain said that he was approached by LAGC president Neil Hubman about becoming an investor and he was eager to be on board.\n\nKopitar’s personal experience with golf is uniquely tied to his time in Los Angeles. Hailing from Slovenia, he didn’t have much experience with golf growing up, but after his decades-long transplant to sunny SoCal, he found himself playing it more and more, especially in charity games put on by the Kings.\n\nThe competitive drive that has made him one of the best hockey players of his generation also played into getting him into golf  as well after a disappointing charity tournament performance left a sour taste in his mouth.\n\n“I wasn't really into it until I severely embarrassed myself my second year on that charity golf tournament. So I figured I’d just work at it a little bit. And then I hit the seven iron right in the sweet spot and then I was hooked,” Kopitar said.\n\nKopitar joins an investor group that includes several other notable athletes and figures in entertainment like primary owners Alexis Ohanian, Serena Williams and Venus Williams and an extended investor group that includes Giannis Antetokounmpo, Alex Morgan and Shonda Rhimes.\n\nWhile he plans to move his family back home to Slovenia when the NHL season is done, taking a stake in LAGC gives Kopitar and his family a new way to stay connected to the community that he’s called his home and left his mark on for two decades.\n\n“It'll be a great excuse for me to come here and see everybody and be a part of this community like I've been for 20 years… Both of my kiddos were born here. We have friends outside of hockey here. Now this thing that popped up with LA Golf Club,” Kopitar said. “It’ll be very fun to come back here and maybe not be as stressed as I am during the season.\"\n\nLAGC's season kicked off with a Jan. 2 match against Boston Common Golf at SoFi Center in Palm Springs, Fla. that ended in a 7-5 victory for Boston Common, the first match of many that Kopitar will have the chance to watch as a new member of the organization.\n\n“Anže represents everything we value at LAGC, elite competition, leadership and a deep connection to Los Angeles. He’s a world-class athlete, a passionate golfer, and someone who understands what it means to represent this city at the highest level. We’re proud to welcome him into our investor group.” Hubman said in LAGC’s official announcement.",

    "title": "Did Real Madrid Figure Something Out Against Real Betis?",
    "description": "It’s possible they did, but Atletico could end that mini honeymoon quick",
    "fullText": "These observations — where I look at Real Madrid’s history, its players on loan, Castilla, tactical tidbits, and other relevant thoughts — are now a regular thing. All previous editions can be found here.\n\nI was asked on a recent Q&A, “if Xabi Alonso were to turn it around and win the Champions League this season, would it be a bigger feat than the 2022 Champions League triumph?”\n\nI had to think about it, and I still don’t have a clear cut answer. I lean towards a hypothetical 2026 Champions League triumph being a bigger achievement than the 2022 one, but only because of how improbable a 180-turnaround from the team seems now, given how gloomy things have been.\n\nBut then I remembered: In 2022, I wrote a column in the winter, on Real Madrid still being able to win the Champions League despite how bad they’ve been. The article was generally laughed at and dismissed. That team was not good enough, they said. Impossible — especially after getting played off the park, barely crossing the half-way line in a loss to PSG in Paris of the first of the Champions League round-of-16. Months later, Real Madrid lifted the Champions League trophy.\n\nThen I remembered another thing: I have an annual article, around this time — completely unintentional — talking about the same thing: ‘Real Madrid have been bad, but they generally don’t find themselves until the spring time’. In each case, it’s never well received.\n\nThis Real Madrid team has instilled little belief in fans, and even the biggest optimist would find it hard to believe in a turnaround. The regression is real. The promise from the Club World Cup, and early returns this season, have vanished. The press has regressed; the confidence zapped. Thibaut Courtois was taking naps earlier this season — now he’s back to being the team’s best player far too often. Alonso has compromised his original ideas in order to meet the players half way. He has lost himself, and it’s going to be hard to go back to his roots now.\n\nReal Madrid’s history cares little for any of this analysis. They would read these words of pessimism and light them on fire. This club is all about adversity and overcoming it. Nothing has ever come easy. In 2022, up until Real Madrid’s loss in Paris, the team looked dead, nowhere close to the elites. This particular team looks even worse. At least that one had Toni Kroos, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric still at their apex. This current team is largely inexperienced, and even among the veterans — apart from Courtois and Carvajal — there is a lack of leadership.\n\nThere is also an important detail that exists this season that didn’t exist in 2022: Xabi Alonso’s job could be over mid-January. The Spanish SuperCopa in Saudi Arabia is a huge litmus test for the Board, and unfortunately for Alonso, Real Madrid have to face two very dangerous teams: A team that is built to beat them (Atletico Madrid), and if they pass that test, they move on to the final to face a team, Barcelona, that is blood-thirsty for revenge.\n\nReal Madrid have not dealt well against teams with high intensity.\n\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find the last time the team put in a good performance for the entirety of 90 minutes. There are spurts of individual brilliance and heroics, but little to gloat about in terms of team chemistry and consistency. The team is in survival mode — reacting to things minute-to-minute among chaos. There is no dominance, no imposition of will. The result, overall, haven’t been great — the process is even worse.\n\nThe issues earlier on in the season are different than the issues now. In September, the team pressed well, created an abundance of chances, and couldn’t convert those forays to build a sizeable lead heading into the second half when the legs tired and the team regressed into a lower block. The morale was mostly good, and trending north.\n\nThings are more leg-heavy now, players are unhappy with their roles, and perhaps too eager to make use of the limited time they have not knowing when their next appearance might be. There is more pressure on the stars to float above, more pressure on the role players to produce in limited cameos, and more pressure on the coach to win. Two possible outcomes: The pressure cuts diamonds, or gives way to collapse.\n\nThere is a path to redemption. Not all is lost. If the glass half-empty look exists, there is also a glass half-full outlook: Real Madrid are hit with injuries to key players: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao. Eduardo Camavinga has barely played due to his health. Carvajal may return as early as the Super Cup (but that in itself is a problem if he’s rushed back). If the board can be patient enough for important defensive figures to return to stabilize the backline and bring some leadership, they can buy time for a possible spring rejuvenation.\n\nAlso, what if Real Madrid does win the Spanish SuperCup? How much momentum will that give them? Enough to launch them into orbit and escape the noise? Is such a thing improbable? Have we not learned enough lessons doubting Real Madrid by now over the past 50 years? Is that naive?\n\nThey still might be the best team in Spain when all is said and done. They still have the league’s best players. Tactically and collectively, they are still off pace from the elite: Arsenal, Bayern Munich, PSG — and possibly others. In the last two months, they’re dropped off even below the B-tier teams.\n\nBut it’s true the surrounding pieces around the young, inexperienced nucleus probably doesn’t have what it takes. Despite Mbappe’s devastating offensive form, Bellingham at his best, Gonzalo levitating against Real Betis, and Rodrygo rising, there is little confidence in the team’s two-way balance. Some of the midfield muscle has gotten stabilizing Eduardo Camavinga, rather than Arda Güler, supporting Jude Bellingham in midfield, but Camavinga also needs to stay fit — his health could swing the balance in a positive way. If both Güler and Camavinga are fit, I would wager Alonso bets on Camavinga for balance purposes in most games.\n\nBut even banking on good health is naive. When one key player returns, another key player is sidelined. Kylian Mbappe’s most recent injury is horrible news given how much the team relies on his pace in transition as well as his finishing and playmaking.\n\nIt’s an abysmally bad season when it comes to goal-scoring, even with Mbappe. Before the Real Betis game it was asked: how bad can it get without him? Before the win over the weekend, the team had only scored 36 goals from an xG of 45.2. It’s a painful number when you compare it to Barcelona’s up until the new year: 51 goals scored from an xG of 47.65. Only one team, Rayo Vallecano, has underperformed their xG even worse. In the Champions League, the numbers are a bit better: 13 goals from an xG of 13. Alonso will hope the league numbers will normalize.\n\nThe defensive numbers aren’t more encouraging. Despite conceding just 16 goals before Christmas, they conceded an xGA of 22.21. It was not good defense that had shut opponents out — it was Thibaut Courtois.\n\nA lot of that goes back to issues from seasons’ prior: the first line of defense has been catastrophic. Despite the pressing trending in a positive direction earlier this season (games against Marseille and Barcelona at home come to mind), it’s got dialled back to an unrecognizable level.\n\nIt’s hard to put into words what’s happenning here:\n\npic.twitter.com/dRSccNQS5u https://t.co/SHMnjN01CH\n\n— Managing Madrid (@managingmadrid) December 28, 2025\n\nThat’s Rodrygo doing everything he physically can. These are fundamentals: A press requires everyone to pull their weight. If there isn’t 100% buy in, you can’t hold a high line:\n\nRecurring thing in the last 2 months: back-line completely out of sync with where they stand, when to step, and when to keep their line. Wasn't as magnified when the press was working earlier this season. Now that the press is gone, you see more of thispic.twitter.com/ztjkcZvmKR\n\n— Kiyan Sobhani (@KiyanSo) January 1, 2026\n\nMore problems arise when the team is facing high pressure. The absences of Trent, Militao, and Carvajal haven’t helped, but the problems also run deeper. Players often make the wrong off-ball runs, show in the wrong areas, make the wrong pass, or delay the pass when quicker build-up is needed:\n\nThere are a couple situations in this clip where Trent would help. pic.twitter.com/mfWssfrmRF https://t.co/q5tbD8jIx7\n\n— Kiyan Sobhani (@KiyanSo) January 5, 2026\n\nThose build-up issues need to be sorted. By now, in an ideal world, Xabi Alonso’s blueprint would’ve been well-marinated into a machine that baits presses and exploits the space in behind, with plenty of attacking weapons to help Real Madrid punish teams who dare to push bodies forward.\n\nThe build-up will become even more strenuous on Thursday against Atletico Madrid. Diego Simeone’s men are masters at hoodwinking you into thinking a passing lane is open. They congest the strong side, invite a switch, and rotate so quickly defensively, you’ll lose the outlet before it even appears.\n\nAnd that’s where Real Madrid will be tested perhaps the most all month, and the Real Betis honeymoon could soon end. There is perhaps no greater thorn in Real Madrid’s side than Atleti — a team whose hearts Real Madrid have shattered on the biggest stage over and over again, but a team that can close space and irritate like no other.\n\nBut it’s also an opportunity to carry the momentum from the Betis game, ride the Gonzalo Garcia heatwave, and carry that energy forward to the Super Cup Final and beyond.\n\nReal Madrid lose a lot without Mbappe, who is probably the best player in the world. There is no discussion about whether or not Mbappe helps the team. However, Real Madrid do gain two things with Gonzalo Garcia starting in lieu of the injured French Superstar: A better first line of defense, and a target in the box.\n\nReal Madrid will need both those things. Atletico Madrid would rather not have their center-backs — of late David Hancko and Marc Pubill — occupied. Gonzalo commands gravity and is an expert off-ball mover in the box. Real Madrid can leverage that skill into creating space for others — Rodrygo making diagonal runs in the box, Jude Bellingham crashing it, Vinicius Jr cutting in.\n\nReal Madrid can stifle Atletico’s build-up, spearheaded by Gonzalo’s effort:\n\nReal Madrid may be better off with only one of Vinicius or Mbappe on the field; pairing one of them with a more natural link-up striker (Gonzalo) that they can play off of. The sample size of Gonzalo plus one of them (mostly Vinicius due to Mbappe’s injuries in the Club World Cup and now), is small, but mostly effective. The sample size with Vinicus and Mbappe together is much larger, but not clicking as it should be. We have virtually zero sample size of Gonzalo and Mbappe together, but it would be fascinating to see a theoretical partnership with them to see what they could cook. Mbappe likes to hang back and receive cut-backs; Gonzalo likes to shake off his marker and attack the six-yard box — that would create space for Mbappe and pull defenders around. That kind of offense doesn’t exist if Gonzalo isn’t on the field.\n\nIt is true that Real Madrid have struggles outside their front line. The defense has looked frail dancing on the high line, and the midfield has gotten overrun more than once. But the problems do, in a lot of ways, start up top — the midfield will always be outnumbered by opponents if the first line of defense is broken. That’s where you can make the case for more Gonzalo and more Rodrygo to balance the team. Valverde’s eventual return to midfield with Carvajal and Trent coming back should help Bellingham, Tchouameni, and Camavinga as well.\n\nBut Alonso can address those questions in the Super Cup Final (if Real Madrid qualify) and beyond. The attack and line-up against Atletico picks itself: copy and pasted from the win over Betis. There is one slight question mark: Dean Huijsen, who is back with the team. But logic suggests Huijsen would not be ready to start a game of this magnitude as his first game back, especially after he struggled with Atletico’s high press in the 5 – 2 debacle earlier this season.\n\n“I think every match has to be analysed, but all defeats, if anything, can teach us more positive lessons,” Alonso said in Wednesday’s pre-game press conference. “There are things we don’t want to repeat from that match, things that we obviously took away from it, but I’m very convinced that it’s going to be different. We mustn’t forget the things that didn’t work well either.”\n\nAtletico are struggling since that 5 – 2 Derby — but they were struggling in the build-up to that game as well. They had gone winless against Espanyol, Elche, Alaves, Liverpool, and Mallorca. Antoine Griezmann hadn’t scored a goal for 22 consecutive matches. But then Griezmann scored against Real Madrid, Atletico pounded Real Madrid on set-pieces and crosses, and pressed them relentlessly.\n\nThis time it’s Julian Alvarez’s turn to go through a drought (he’s scored just one goal since that aforementioned Derby), and Atletico are coming off a poor showing against Real Sociedad. Pablo Barrios, their most important midfielder this season, is injured. Atletico are also defanged away from home (they’ve earned just 13 points out of a possible 30 this season away from the Metropolitano).\n\nStill — you know that all goes out the window on Thursday. Atletico will be blood-hungry, as they always are against Real Madrid — and if Real Madrid don’t exceed that intensity, it’s going to be tough to win a must-win Derby.",

    "fullText": "The crypto market was spared a blow this week after indexing giant MSCI opted not to delist crypto holding companies from its indexes.\n\nMSCI decided not to proceed with a proposal to exclude digital asset treasuries from its indexes, though it said it would conduct a wider review of how some companies are treated.\n\nThe move spares companies like Strategy and other firms whose main business is buying and holding crypto from a potentially devastating blow. If MSCI dumped those stocks, many investors who track its indexes would have likely followed suit. However, it leaves the door open to a crackdown in the future.\n\nStrategy stock spiked as much as 5% on the news.\n\nWhen the MSCI first said it was considering excluding firms with 50% or more assets in crypto, the idea sparked strong backlash from the industry. MSCI's argument was that crypto treasuries are more like investment funds than operating companies, and should be treated differently for the purposes of inclusion in some of its world indexes.\n\nFrank Chaparro, head of content at crypto market maker GSR, said that the updates is a subtle but important developement for the crypto market, which is still fragile following the market meltdown sent prices plummeting in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"As leverage unwound and sentiment around these structures deteriorated, weakness in DAT equities spilled over into broader crypto risk appetite,\" he told Business Insider. \"Against that backdrop, any credible bullish catalyst for the space, particularly one tied to index inclusion and institutional access, carries outsized signaling value right now.\"\n\nChaparro added that while many exchange platforms offer investors the opportunity to purchase crypto, the majority of traders still opt to gain exposure through funds and other index-linked products.\n\nThat said, MSCI signaled that it plans to embark on a broader consultation over how \"non-operating companies\" should be treated. Another bout of uncertainty related to indexing could create fresh headwinds for Strategy and other companies that hoard crypto on their balance sheets.\n\nChaparro said that he thinks this strong scrutiny on the part of the index is justified, highlighting the importance of holding DATs to high standards\n\n\"Companies that function more like investment funds than operating businesses with bitcoin as a core treasury asset should be evaluated differently and potentially excluded,\" he said. \"Clear and consistent criteria will be essential to preserve index integrity as these structures proliferate.\"",

    "description": "Two women deepened a fast friendship with monthly presentation nights, using photos and stories to share their histories and connect more deeply.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rachel Jones, cohost of the \"Is It Normal\" podcast. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was recently introduced to Eloisa by a mutual friend who was certain we'd become fast friends.\n\nThat friend was right, because Eloisa and I clicked straight away. We shared similar interests — books and art — and had this chemistry that I can't quite explain. I knew we'd be best friends.\n\nAs we began to get to know each other, both of us keen to \"dig deep\" and understand each other as fully as possible, we would often say things like, \"To understand this part of me, you need some context.\"\n\nAlthough we would have liked to jump into each other's histories, we were limited by time constraints.\n\nI work full-time, volunteer, own a house, participate heavily in church activities, and have family and friends I'm already committed to. Eloisa has a husband and is a full-time student. We're both very busy people, but we're keen to connect on a deeper level because neither of us wants coffee-once-a-month friendships.\n\nIn your late teens and early 20s, forming friendships is relatively easy, as people often have less responsibility and more time. But the older you get, the harder it can be to form meaningful relationships — because there are only so many hours in a day. And yet, when you meet friends at an older age, there is so much more life to catch up on, just not the time to do it.\n\nI'd seen on social media a trending way to get to know friends as adults — presentation evenings. Each person involved gives a short presentation about themselves, which may include both serious and humorous topics.\n\nTypically, people create slideshows with lots of pictures to accompany whatever is being presented. I'd seen a huge range of topics: what's my love language, favorite books, favorite memories, teenage years, and the list of ideas for these nights goes on and on.\n\nExcited about the possibility, I asked Eloisa if she'd be up for it, and as I suspected, she couldn't wait.\n\nFor our first presentation night, we decided to kick off our monthly series by sharing stories about our childhoods.\n\nJust the process of preparing my slideshow was precious. I went through dozens of photos of my family, reflecting on the significant changes I experienced as a child, and remembering how fortunate I was to grow up in such a close-knit family with my parents and three siblings.\n\nWe planned to present after dinner one evening, both allowing each other to share without interruption.\n\nWhen I'm typically getting to know a friend just through conversation, both of us are lovingly interrupting each other, interjecting thoughts in response to what the other person has said. But in presenting, you're quiet when it isn't your turn, so the listener has a chance to fully absorb what the other person says.\n\nI listened to Eloise speak about her childhood, and I immediately could piece together why she is the way she is because of her history.\n\nWhen I presented, I methodically talked about my birthday, my parents, my siblings, and how I had lived in several houses in multiple countries.\n\nIt was a lighthearted theme, but even so, she now understands why stability is so important to me, and why I tend to crave acceptance from people. A lot of that is down to my childhood.\n\nAs a visual learner, I found the presentation night so helpful in remembering the people Eloise spoke about. So now, when she tells me about her sister, I can visualize her sister and recall Eloise's relationship with her growing up. Facts about Eloise get ingrained in my memory because I've had photos and so much context.\n\nI expect that as we hold these presentation nights more frequently — we're hoping to do them monthly — we'll get to know each other better, both on a serious and a silly level.\n\nAs we continue to be friends, carrying on with these presentations, we'll understand each other's triggers more and be able to respond better and give informed advice.\n\nIt's the first time I've had presentation nights with a friend, but I suspect I'll bring in other friends to join us on our evenings. I also think it would be a really helpful thing to do with a boyfriend or partner in the future.\n\nThe fact that Eloise wanted to have these presentation nights with me felt like a privilege, because it's someone who wants to know me and invest in our friendship.\n\nTo be known and feel seen is one of the greatest desires we have a humans, and these presentations provide a way to do this in our busy, modern, adulting worlds.",

    "description": "It's the latest example of Trump taking steps to insert himself into business.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump took a big swing at business on Wednesday — saying he would put a stop to practices he deemed undesirable at defense firms and large housing investors.\n\nIn a series of posts on Truth Social, the president said he wants to ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes in the US. He also criticized defense firms' issuing dividends, stock buybacks, and \"exorbitant\" pay packages — and called out Raytheon by name. The market reacted quickly: Shares for private equity firm Blackstone and defense stocks dropped immediately following Trump's posts.\n\nWednesday evening, Trump issued an executive order aimed at defense firms, stating, \"Effective immediately, they are not permitted in any way, shape, or form to pay dividends or buy back stock, until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\nIt's the latest example of Trump taking steps to insert himself into business, having taken equity stakes in several companies over the last year. (See Business Insider's new series on \"The Future of Capitalism.)\n\nMany housing economists agree that banning large investors from buying or owning single-family homes would likely do little nationally to improve housing affordability, which has deteriorated in large part because of a shortage of homes. \n\n\"If we actually wanted to solve that problem, bringing down the cost of home ownership, what we should be doing is increasing the supply of housing,\" Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, told Business Insider.\n\nBusiness Insider's James Rodriguez has reported that, despite being the \"villains\" of the housing market, large investors don't actually own a significant portion of America's homes.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors with at least 10 units in their portfolio owned roughly 3.4% of all single-family homes in the country. Big investors with at least 1,000 units — a group that includes major companies such as AMH Homes, Invitation Homes, Tricon Residential, and Pretium — owned just 0.73% of units.\n\nThat share is much higher in certain housing markets, particularly in the southeast.\n\nIt's unclear if Trump will be able to stop future payouts from defense firms. The one he singled out, Raytheon, for example, announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023, and said it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.\n\nIn his posts, Trump said Raytheon \"has been the least responsive,\" \"the slowest,\" and the \"most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military.\"\n\nOf defense firms overall, he said that until they build \"NEW and MODERN Production Plants\" their executives' pay should be capped at $5 million.",

    "description": "Amazon updates its performance review system to require corporate employees share specific work achievements.",
    "fullText": "Amazon has a new question for its corporate workforce: What did you get done last year?\n\nAs part of this year's performance review process, known internally as Forte, Amazon is asking corporate employees to submit three to five \"accomplishments\" that best reflect their work, according to people familiar with the matter and an internal guideline obtained by Business Insider.\n\nEmployees are required to provide \"specific examples\" of what they delivered, along with actions they plan to take to continue growing at the company, the guideline added.\n\n\"Accomplishments are specific projects, goals, initiatives, or process improvements that show the impact of your work,\" the internal guideline states. \"Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn't lead to the results you hoped for.\"\n\nThis marks the first time Amazon has explicitly formalized Forte around individual accomplishments, according to the people. They asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.\n\nWhile the company has long included a self-assessment component, past reviews asked employees broader questions about their \"super powers,\" areas of interest, and questions like, \"When you're at your best, how do you contribute?\" An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nForte is a key driver of employee compensation. Managers also consider peer feedback, adherence to Amazon's Leadership Principles, and job-specific skills to assign an \"Overall Value\" rating, which determines annual pay.\n\nThe move reflects Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's continued push to build a more disciplined workforce and a more unified corporate culture. Last year, he enforced a full return-to-office policy, cut management layers, and overhauled Amazon's pay model and performance review process to more clearly reward top performers.\n\nThis is part of a broader change in how tech companies treat employees. After years of mollycoddling talent, the industry has become tougher. Elon Musk started this in 2022, by demanding to know what Twitter employees accomplished each week. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed suit with his year of intensity. Even Google has toughened up.\n\nSome teams at Amazon, including the advertising and the IMDb video units, began pilot-testing a similar Forte question a few years ago. At the time, advertising chief Paul Kotas told employees that sharing specific accomplishments \"helps facilitate a more productive\" conversation with managers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "No sugar, more fat: RFK Jr's new dietary guidelines include 5 big changes and an upside-down food pyramid",
    "description": "Kennedy said his new guidelines undo previous advice. Full fat dairy is back, sugar is out, and highly processed foods come under fire.",
    "fullText": "That's the stated intention of the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, released Wednesday by the federal government.\n\n\"Real food is back at the center of the American diet,\" a video from the Department of Health and Human Services says, on the government's new realfood.gov website.\n\nThe federal guidelines, which are updated every five years, serve as a guidepost for nutrition and health advice and form the basis for federal food programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, as well as meals and snacks for the military, veterans, and preschoolers in Head Start.\n\nThe new realfood.gov site claims that Americans have been \"misled\" by previous guidelines, an idea that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. echoed Wednesday at the White House.\n\n\"The hard truth is that our government has been lying to us to protect corporate profit-taking, telling us that these food-like substances were beneficial to public health,\" he said. \"These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation's food culture and Make America Healthy Again.\"\n\nIn 1992, the food pyramid was introduced into the guidelines, encouraging bread and pasta to form the basis of the American diet:\n\nThe original food pyramid has been heavily criticized for being too cozy with food lobbyists, particularly in the grains industry, as it prioritized more bread, cereal, rice, and pasta than sound nutrition advice would recommend.\n\nIt was replaced in 2011 by \"My Plate,\" a new framework meant to simplify how people thought about building their daily meals. Vegetables, protein, and grains were prominent on the plate, with an emphasis on consuming more whole grains:\n\nUnder Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" campaign, a new upside-down pyramid was unveiled on Wednesday:\n\nThe new pyramid deliberately de-prioritizes whole grains by flipping the triangle upside down — even though it's not a true inversion of the old pyramid, which had \"bad\" ingredients, like sweets, fats, and oils, at the top.\n\nThe new pyramid has as its cornerstone protein and \"healthy\" fat, which Kennedy said \"are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines.\"\n\nFor the first time, the new guidelines encourage people to prioritize \"high-quality, nutrient-dense\" protein at each meal.\n\nAnimal sources are recommended, such as eggs, poultry, seafood, and red meat, even though most nutritionists would encourage a focus on lean proteins like chicken, fish, and plants like beans, nuts, and seeds, with less red meat.\n\nThe daily protein serving goal, at 1.2-1.6 grams per kilogram of your body weight, is generally in line with what dietitians and protein experts recommend. For example, a 150-pound person would be aiming for about 82 to 109 grams of protein every day on this plan, far more than previous guidelines would suggest.\n\n\"We are ending the war on saturated fats,\" Kennedy said Wednesday.\n\nThe new guidelines encourage consumers to \"include full-fat dairy,\" which is a somewhat controversial stance among nutritionists, especially when it comes to foods like butter and milk.\n\nChristopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford who was on the expert panel convened in 2024 to advise health authorities on the new dietary guidelines, had said in a previous committee meeting that \"butter is not back\" — at least, not according to any new scientific data.\n\nGardner raised concerns about how butter can raise your LDL cholesterol, in particular, affecting the arteries.\n\nThere is more scientific debate about full-fat cheese and full-fat yogurt, because of the unique ways that calcium and protein are arranged in those foods.\n\nThe new guidelines also highlight the importance of fermented foods, including the dairy item kefir, for promoting a healthy microbiome, which is something nutrition experts and scientists are increasingly emphasizing.\n\nUltra-processed foods are in the crosshairs of the new guidelines. Evidence has been mounting for years that these foods tend to make people eat more calories, and can promote inflammation and, over time, contribute to chronic health issues.\n\n\"If a foreign adversary sought to destroy the health of our children, to cripple our economy, to weaken our national security, there would be no better strategy than to addict us to ultra-processed foods,\" Kennedy said.\n\nNutrition experts say it's generally true that ultra-processed foods are not great, but the composition of those foods still matters. UPFs with more vegetables and whole grains in them are better choices than sugary beverages and sweets. Some studies have suggested that certain ultra-processed items like packaged yogurts with added sugar and industrial whole-grain cereals may not be so detrimental to our health after all.\n\nIn the new pyramid, there is no place for a sugar bowl, because \"added sugars are not part of eating real foods.\"\n\nThe new pyramid recommended avoiding added sugars entirely, while allowing naturally occurring sugar from fruit and dairy.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading sources of added sugar in the American diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks, so though it may be challenging to nix all added sugar in your diet, given the food landscape we live in, cutting back on those items is a simple place to start.",

    "title": "Hegseth's prosecution of Mark Kelly sends a chilling message to US troops and veterans, legal analysts say",
    "description": "Experts said Hegseth's language suggests a predetermined outcome, and that the repercussions could impact troops and retirees.",
    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's extraordinary move to demote a retired military veteran in the Senate comes after weeks of threats for more severe punishment, and experts on military law said it has implications for speech by troops and retired military.\n\nThe highly public decision to censure Democratic Sen. Mark Kelley and to possibly dock his military pension is likely to make military retirees think twice before publicly criticizing the Trump administration, two former military lawyers said. About 2 million people receive military retirement benefits in the US. Some retired military leaders have been strident critics of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe defense secretary announced the decision to review Kelly, a retired Navy captain and astronaut who represents Arizona, for a reduction in his retired grade and pay on Monday, saying the senator's public statements, including a video in which he told US troops not to follow illegal orders, amount to sedition. The two experts on military law said they believe Kelly would have strong grounds to challenge it through the Defense Department's processes or in federal court.\n\nHegseth said the process would be completed within 45 days, and added that he issued a formal censure letter, \"which outlines the totality of Captain (for now) Kelly's reckless misconduct. This Censure is a necessary process step, and will be placed in Captain Kelly's official and permanent military personnel file.\"\n\nDon C. King, a retired Navy judge advocate general who now owns the King Military Law firm, said the fact that the statement was posted by Hegseth on X is \"very unusual\" and ensures the actions against Kelly are well publicized. \"I've never seen that happen before.\"\n\nHegseth's public comments could give Kelly grounds to argue that the grade determination board, made up of military officers, is predisposed to punish the misconduct that the defense secretary alleged and in the way he suggested it.\n\nHegseth's statement \"strongly suggests a predetermined outcome,\" Daniel Maurer, a law professor at Ohio Northern University and a retired Army judge advocate general, said. \"It is the opposite of a measured, unbiased, and due process-focused announcement that protects the integrity of the process and rights of the service member.\"\n\nKelly's actions, Maurer argued, don't meet the definition of sedition under federal law. \"What he said was a restatement of the law and a professional duty,\" he noted; the official manual for courts-martial says service members may disobey a \"patently illegal order.\"\n\nHegseth previously threatened to court-martial Kelly, which likely didn't move forward because of a lack of evidence, experts said. It nonetheless has profound implications for serving officers, whose careers can be marred or effectively ended for having lost their superior's confidence.\n\nHegseth called Kelly's comments seditious in the Monday X post: \"This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay.\"\n\nHegseth cited 10 U.S.C. § 1370(f), a subsection of the Title 10 Armed Forces law, in his decision. Per federal code, military officers are retired in the highest rank \"served satisfactorily,\" and that determines the officer's pension. By law, officer grade determination is based on the officer's conduct while on active duty, not post-retirement.\n\nThe code establishes the reconsideration of an officer's retirement rank as possible under only four reasons. The first is if their rank was procured by fraud. The second is based on whether substantial evidence for revisiting retirement rank comes out afterward, but that's contemplating actions that occurred while the person was on active duty. The third is if a mistake was made in determining the retired grade. None of those applies to Kelly's case.\n\nThe fourth, which experts believe is what Hegseth is referring to, is if the defense secretary determines \"that good cause exists to reopen the determination of retired grade.\"\n\nIt's a fuzzy argument, though. \"I don't see a strong legal case for what Secretary Hegseth is purporting to do,\" King said. \"I don't know that this law supports what he's trying to do.\"\n\nFollowing the review and board recommendation, it's likely that Hegseth's decision could be overturned in court. It would be a \"strong sign\" for the speech rights of service members, Maurer told BI. Kelly may also have additional protections as an elected federal lawmaker under the Constitution's speech and debate clause.\n\nKelly, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made comments in the video released before new allegations emerged in late November about the US military's move to fire a missile at a boat it had already struck. The Pentagon's law of war manual calls an attack on shipwreck survivors illegal.\n\nNow, Kelly has 30 days to submit a response to the proceedings. In a public statement online, the senator said he'd fight back and added: \"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired service member that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way.\"\n\nThat appears to be a consequence of this, Maurer said, which he called \"a chilling effect on retired officers, especially senior-ranking\" ones.\n\nKelly's unusual case comes against the backdrop of a broader crackdown on what military personnel say and post, especially regarding the US' strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, progressive politics, and the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Some troops have sought to self-censor for fear of retaliation.",

    "description": "The Trump administration's new dietary guidelines recommend Americans eat more full-fat dairy. This contradicts established nutrition advice.",
    "fullText": "Dairy started to roar back into fashion in 2025 — and if the Trump administration's new dietary guidelines are anything to go by, it could be about to reach new heights.\n\nThe 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which provide Americans with a framework for what the government considers a healthy diet, advise people to aim for three servings of full-fat dairy per day. The document, released on Wednesday, name-checks butter, whole milk, and \"real\" cheese.\n\nIn the past two years, dairy has had a glow-up as innovative products, blending health and food trends with dairy staples, hit the market. Think indie brands selling cinnamon bun butter and mint chocolate-chip probiotic ice cream, and Fairlife Ultra-filtered milk becoming more popular than ever. Dairy is typically minimally processed, high in protein, and fermented versions are good for gut health.\n\nBut the new guidance contradicts a strong body of evidence linking a diet high in full-fat dairy products and red or processed meat, which are high in saturated fats, to cardiovascular disease.\n\nRecommending full-fat dairy like butter is a big pivot from the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encouraged us to \"move to low-fat or fat-free dairy milk or yogurt or lactose-free dairy or fortified make half soy versions.\"\n\nThis was partly why plant-based diets and alt-milks became hot commodities in the 2010s. Then, some shoppers started to wonder if some of types of products were high enough in protein and more processed than they'd realized.\n\nIn 2024, the organic dairy sector grew by 9.8% up from 5.6% the previous year, according to data shared with Business Insider last year by New Hope Network, an organic-focused consultancy firm. This is far higher than the one or two percent a year increase seen since around 2015.\n\nDuring this time, whole dairy products like raw milk and home-churned butter have become synonymous with the Make America Healthy Again movement helmed by the health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an architect of the new guidelines. It's all part of the conservative vibe shift of the past year.\n\nRFK Jr. said Wednesday these new guidelines are \"how we Make America Healthy Again,\" but public health experts have been quick to point out their contradictions.\n\nNeal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, said that the guidelines recommend limiting cholesterol-raising \"bad\" or saturated fat, while simultaneously promoting red meat and full-fat dairy products.",

    "description": "Taiwan is searching for a missing F-16 fighter jet and pilot after an incident earlier this week.",
    "fullText": "Taiwan's air force has grounded its F-16 fleet and suspended training missions on the jet after one of the planes and the pilot went missing earlier this week.\n\nThe search continues for the pilot and aircraft, which officials believe went down following an in-flight \"anomaly,\" but rough seas off the island have made efforts difficult.\n\nOn Tuesday night local time, an American-made F-16 fighter jet assigned to the Taiwan Air Force's Fifth Tactical Air Wing operating out of Hualien Air Base went missing in the waters off the northeast coast of the island. The Air Force said the fighter was separated from a group during a nighttime training session after the jets entered cloud cover.\n\nThe F-16 suddenly descended quickly. Its altitude was just 1,700 feet when radar contact was lost. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has identified the missing pilot as Capt. Hsin Po-yi. Officials remain unsure whether Hsin successfully ejected from the aircraft, although he had indicated he would eject seconds before the aircraft disappeared. It's unclear if he did.\n\nIn the days since the incident, a search and rescue mission has been ongoing in the waters off Hualien County. Multiple aircraft and vessels have been involved in the mission, but tall waves and strong winds have been complicating the search for the jet and Hsin.\n\nAir Force officials told reporters during a press conference on Wednesday that there appeared to be a malfunction of the F-16's main onboard computer in which the aircraft's flight path was no longer displayed.\n\nNow, Taiwanese air force officials have grounded all of Taiwan's F-16 fleet for inspections, and training missions have been temporarily suspended. Taiwan currently has about 140 F-16s, the older A/B models, that it has upgraded in recent years. It is expected to receive a batch of the newer F-16V or Viper jets in the coming years to add to its fleet.\n\nThe F-16 is made by American defense giant Lockheed Martin. Though it's been flying for over 50 years, it still represents a highly capable fourth-generation jet. The newest operator of the aircraft is Ukraine, which received a limited number from NATO partner nations.\n\nThis crash involving the Taiwanese military follows a similar incident that occurred in January 2022, when a Taiwanese F-16 went down off the island's west coast while taking part in training exercises. At the time, the F-16 went missing after taking off from Chiayi Air Base in southern Taiwan. In response, Taiwan suspended its combat training for the fleet.\n\nIt's not uncommon to see fleets grounded after accidents, especially if the cause is unclear. The US military has done this regularly.\n\nTaiwan's Air Force has been strained in recent years by constant scrambling to track Chinese military aircraft, which regularly fly into the country's air defense identification zone. Taipei's smaller air force has experienced higher operational tempos that have exhausted pilots, aircraft, and resources and stressed maintainers. Most recently, Taiwan held rapid response drills in reaction to China's massive exercises nearby.",

    "fullText": "New Year's Eve is behind us, but if you hear the sound of bottles popping — it might be coming from the halls of Morgan Stanley's headquarters.\n\nThe Wall Street bank on Wednesday announced the appointment of 184 new managing directors — a roughly 6% increase from last year's class of 173 MDs.\n\nAt Morgan Stanley, managing director is the firm's highest designation. The announcement comes amid the annual promotion season on Wall Street and follows Goldman Sachs' November elevation of more than 600 managing directors, part of a biennial process at the rival firm.\n\nThe size of each of Morgan Stanley's annual MD classes has fluctuated. In 2024, the bank named 155 managing directors. In 2023, it also appointed 184; and in 2022, it elevated 199.\n\nSeventy percent of the newly appointed execs work in a revenue-generating capacity, interacting with clients and making the bank money, while 30% work in middle- and back-office or corporate functions.\n\nThe promotions come after a strong year for the firm's dealmaking business. Morgan Stanley finished third on the worldwide M&A financial advisory league tables, according to LSEG, trailing only Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.\n\nIt ended the year advising on more than $1 trillion in deal value across more than 400 transactions, LSEG's December data show. That marked a significant jump from the prior year, when the bank advised on roughly $707 billion in deals across 368 mergers or acquisitions.\n\nAcross Wall Street, headhunters and investment bankers have told Business Insider in recent weeks that they expect 2026 to generate robust activity in mergers and the capital markets. That backdrop may help explain why 48% of Morgan Stanley's new managing directors came from its Institutional Securities Group, which advises corporate clients on IPOs, buyouts, and sales.\n\nThe bank informed the newly elevated executives on Wednesday and is expected to release the full list of names publicly in the coming days. The firm has also communicated bonuses to its employees, one of the first on Wall Street to inform workers how their contributions from last year resulted in their incentive compensation.\n\nBelow is a look at the statistics Morgan Stanley shared about the composition of its 2026 managing director class.\n\n70% in Revenue, 30% in Infrastructure, the firm's middle- and back-office or corporate functions.\n\nRegionally, Americas 67%, EMEA 18%, Asia 14%\n\nOf US-based MD promotes, 31% of the class are ethnically diverse and 69% are White.",

    "description": "Avelo Airlines began operating deportation flights in May and has seen protests and calls for boycotts in response.",
    "fullText": "It turns out that deporting people for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency isn't the profit booster Avelo Airlines had hoped.\n\nThe budget airline announced a new network strategy on Tuesday designed to strengthen its balance sheet after years of inconsistent earnings, including the closure of several bases and the removal of six aircraft from its fleet.\n\nAmong the closures is Mesa, Arizona — the core of Avelo's chartered aircraft support for the federal government's highly controversial mass deportations. A company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that this also means the end of its ICE contract.\n\n\"Avelo will close the base at [Mesa] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,\" they said. \"The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.\"\n\nThe airline began operating these deportation flights in May but received significant backlash from travelers and faced protests at airports like Albany, Burbank, and New Haven, Connecticut. Avelo has not disclosed the amount it has received from the government.\n\nIt has also downplayed the political optics.\n\nAvelo's CEO, Andrew Levy, previously framed the decision to fly migrants out of the US as financially driven, acknowledging that it is a \"sensitive and complicated topic,\" but said the ICE charters would provide the company with stability and keep its crew members employed.\n\nA spokesperson in April said that Avelo had also operated deportation flights under the Biden Administration.\n\n\"Regardless of the administration or party affiliation, as a US flag carrier, when our country calls and requests assistance, our practice is to say 'yes,'\" they said. \"We follow all protocols from DHS and FAA, honoring our core value of safety always.\"\n\nCharter airlines Miami-based Global Crossing Airlines and Kansas City-based Eastern Air Express have long carried out deportations on behalf of ICE. GlobalX, for example, said its five-year contract awarded in 2024 is expected to generate roughly $65 million in annual revenue.\n\nBut activists said Avelo's involvement reflects a broader shift in the deportation system, as it's unusual for scheduled commercial airlines like Avelo to dedicate aircraft and crews to ICE flights.\n\nThis focal point of criticism coincides with the broader expansion of deportation activity under the Trump Administration that prompted ICE's need to enlist additional operators.\n\nThere were nearly 12,000 deportation, domestic shuttle, and other removal-related flights across operators between President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20 and November 30, 2025, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Human Rights First.\n\nThe Avelo flights are also reportedly not meeting the expected safety standards. Avelo's flight attendant union said in a September memo to Avelo management that the cabin crew \"were discouraged or prohibited from performing safety checks and cabin walk-throughs required by the FAA.\"\n\nIt added that there weren't any aircraft modifications that would allow restrained passengers to evacuate during an emergency.\n\nThe cabin crew working these ICE flights were specifically hired for this role, as were pilots and mechanics. According to the April cabin crew listing, pay started at $28 per hour.\n\nAvelo's operation once stretched coast-to-coast as the airline expanded aggressively into new markets in search of demand.\n\nBut competition intensified, and Avelo struggled to achieve consistent profitability as rivals like Breeze Airways — along with legacy carriers offering low-cost basic economy fares — lured away price-sensitive customers.\n\nThe airline has been reshaping its network and fleet in response to those pressures for years.\n\nAs part of that retrenchment — and beyond the now-deemed money-losing ICE flights — Avelo announced an order for Embraer E195-E2 aircraft, a smaller regional jet that marks a shift away from its traditionally all-Boeing fleet.\n\nAvelo also closed its entire West Coast operation in October due to low demand and pivoted its focus to the East Coast. The carrier also plans to exit its base at Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, in January, axing routes to Montego Bay and Cancún. The airline cited revenue underperformance.\n\nFurther, Avelo is closing bases in Raleigh and Wilmington, North Carolina. It will instead focus its operations out of four core airports: New Haven, Connecticut; Wilmington, Delaware; Charlotte, North Carolina — operating out of the city's smaller Concord-Padgett Regional Airport — and Lakeland, Florida.\n\nAvelo said it plans to open a base in McKinney, Texas, near Dallas, in late 2026.\n\nThis pivot reinforces the airline's strategy of connecting secondary airports to larger cities while still accessible to major metropolitan areas — for example, its Delaware base serves the Philadelphia region, and Lakeland sits between Orlando and Tampa.\n\n\"These changes enable Avelo to focus on sustainably scaling five core bases in 2026 and to prepare the company for growth in the coming years, facilitated by the company's recent order for up to 100 Embraer 195-E2 aircraft,\" the company said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump took executive action aimed at defense contractors after a series of Truth Social posts.\n\nThe president signed an executive order on Wednesday that would ban defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\n\"Every firm across our economy has a right to profit from prudent investment and hard work, but the American defense industrial base also has the responsibility to ensure that America's warfighters have the best possible equipment and weapons,\" the order said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump said he would \"not permit\" stock buybacks or dividends from US defense companies in a post on Truth Social.\n\nIn his post, the president blasted defense contractors for issuing \"massive\" dividends and buying back their stock. He said he wouldn't permit such practices until defense firms sped up production.\n\n\"Therefore, I will not permit Dividends or Stock Buybacks for Defense Companies until such time as these problems are rectified,\" he wrote. \"MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH!\"\n\nTrump also took issue with what he called \"exorbitant and unjustifiable\" compensation packages for industry executives. Until companies build \"NEW and MODERN\" production plants, defense execs should be making no more than $5 million, he said, without providing details on how those guidelines would be implemented.\n\nHe later singled out Raytheon in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nDefense stocks fell after Trump's Truth Social post on Wednesday. Notable movers include:\n\nThe defense sector has been a big focus for Trump dating back to his first term as president. In the past year, he's floated projects like creating a Golden Dome missile defense system and signed off on increasing defense spending to a record $901 billion.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's leveraged buyout bid again, citing financial and litigation risk",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board raised its hackles on Wednesday while rejecting Paramount Skydance's bid for the eighth time in favor of Netflix's offer.\n\nWBD used pointed language, calling Paramount's bid the \"largest leveraged buyout in history by a wide margin\" and tying its potential failure to previous big LBOs that didn't close on the initially agreed-upon terms.\n\nIn its new filing, WBD also described Paramount's financial condition as \"not strong,\" noting that its credit was already rated \"junk\" by S&P before the \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" required by the deal. Paramount, for its part, has emphasized that $40.4 billion in equity of its new bid is fully backstopped by Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nWBD's strong language suggests that the board and leadership \"just want to move on,\" and the \"largest LBO\" angle is a new and compelling one, Wharton M&A professor Paul Nary said on X.\n\nDavid Zaslav-led WBD also ramped up its accusations that Paramount has acted litigiously and leaked to the press.\n\nIn the filing, WBD cited new press reports in the New York Post indicating Paramount was considering abandoning its offer and might pursue \"DefCon 1\" litigation against WBD's board. WBD said that Paramount didn't deny the reports, suggesting that the company was leaking to the press. WBD had previously complained that there had been \"extensive media leaks and rumors\" about Paramount's proposals.\n\nM&A experts said the stepped-up language was likely drafted in anticipation of a lawsuit against WBD, either by Paramount or WBD shareholders.\n\nNow that Paramount has lost to Netflix, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit,\" said Raul Gastesi, a partner at Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella.\n\nCorey Martin, managing partner of Granderson Des Rochers, a law firm focused on entertainment and media, said the new filing felt calibrated to deter WBD shareholders from backing Paramount's hostile bid.\n\n\"The audience is really the shareholders, because there's always the risk of shareholder lawsuits,\" Martin said. \"It is colorful stuff, but Paramount's is a hostile bid.\"\n\nMartin also saw the emphasis on legal and press tactics as part of a PR strategy to portray Paramount as a bad actor, as well as a pre-litigation tactic.\n\nLightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a note on Wednesday that Paramount could still outbid Netflix, but it would \"require an overhaul of their current bid, and a dramatic increase in the cash invested from the Ellison family and/or their friends and financing partners.\"",

    "fullText": "A new year means new opportunities to find great new items at Costco. And as an employee of 20 years, I love that I'm always able to get a front-row seat to the newest products.\n\nFrom elegant furniture to tasty treats, here are eight of the best items I'm seeing on shelves this month.\n\nCostco is now carrying a four-pack of the popular Touchland hydrating hand sanitizers.\n\nThis sanitizing spray kills most common bacteria without drying out your hands. Plus, the set includes a variety of delicate scents with apple, berry, citrus, and vanilla-blossom notes.\n\nThe small bottles are easy to travel with and can be kept in purses, backpacks, lunch boxes, and more.\n\nIt's been a while since I've seen the Canon Rebel T7 camera bundle at Costco. So if picking up a new hobby is on your list of new year's resolutions, now is a great time to act.\n\nThe beginner-friendly bundle comes with everything you need to get started, including the camera, two lenses, a backpack, and an SD card with an adapter.\n\nIt's January, which means Costco typically gets lots of new furniture in. One statement piece that caught my eye is the Abbyson Home display cabinet.\n\nIt comes in a beautiful rich, dark finish that complements a range of styles, and would be great for displaying decor and collectibles in a home or office.\n\nThe new blueberry cheesecake croissants in the bakery section have been selling quickly at my store.\n\nThese flaky, buttery pastries are stuffed with a rich, creamy blueberry cheesecake filling. The bottom is also caramelized for a nice crunchy finish.\n\nThe Italian-style Tutta Bella margherita pizzas are an easy weeknight dinner option, found in the Costco deli coolers.\n\nThey come in a pack of two and are great to keep in the freezer for nights when cooking sounds like a chore.\n\nIf you're looking for a high-resolution home security camera, the Reolink system may be a good option.\n\nThe bundle comes with eight weatherproof cameras that are made to withstand everything from thunderstorms to extreme temperatures. Plus, they connect to an app, which allows you to check on your home at any time.\n\nIf you're following a protein-rich diet, the Premiere Protein frozen pancakes are a great way to reach your goals.\n\nEach box comes with 36 pancakes that are convenient and ready to eat after less than two minutes in the microwave. Each serving delivers 15 grams of protein and 210 calories.\n\nCostco was not involved in the sourcing or writing of this story. The views contained within represent the author's personal views.",

    "description": "An Oakland federal court judge just paved the way for a Musk-Altman showdown, rejecting OpenAI's efforts to end the case ahead of trial.",
    "fullText": "It looks like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are headed for a courtroom showdown.\n\nDuring a hearing on Wednesday, a California judge said she plans to reject Altman's lawyers' last-ditch efforts to end Musk's case against OpenAI and its CEO.\n\n\"This case is going to trial,\" US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said at a hearing to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" she said, referring to Musk's case. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nIn his lawsuit filed in 2024, Musk accused OpenAI of misleading him in its decision to abandon its original nonprofit mission and structure in favor of a profit-oriented model, including through its partnership with Microsoft.\n\nMusk says he donated $38 million to the maker of ChatGPT over the years to support its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humankind. The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure. Musk later went on to launch his own AI company, xAI, in 2023.",

    "description": "The U.S. government is proteinmaxxing with new dietary guidelines recommending more meat and fewer whole grains. Dietitians and doctors disagree.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. government today announced that it's ending the \"war on protein.\"\n\nIf there's a war on, protein seems to already be winning it. The nutrient has dominated grocery lists, store aisles, and social media feeds for the past year.\n\nThe protein obsession is big business, driving products like protein pancakes, protein popcorn, protein lattes, and more. Last fall, Starbucks debuted a $2 \"protein foam\" that you can add to any cold drink.\n\nNow it's the first word in the new dietary guidelines, straight from Robert F. Kennedy Jr's \"Make America Healthy Again\" playbook, with an emphasis on meaty meals like steak and chicken.\n\nBut doctors and dietitians have been warning that protein is beginning to eclipse other crucial nutrients on Americans' plates. And, far from helping us cut back on ultra-processed foods, the protein craze has been a boon for food manufacturing, as protein has been added to health-ify chips, candy, pastries, and cereal.\n\nHere's what to know about the latest recommendations, how to figure out the right amount of protein for you, and the best ways to get it.\n\nThere's no question that protein is an essential nutrient, helping to support healthy muscles and bones, regulate metabolism, and manage appetite.\n\nIt's also true that it can be challenging for some people to get enough protein.\n\nFor decades, women were urged to diet on protein-poor fad foods like cabbage soup and plain grapefruits, mistakenly thinking a hearty meal or heavy weight would make us bulky. Now, in part thanks to the rise of strength training, our appetites have come back with a vengeance, and protein is a major part of the menu.\n\nThe recent boom of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss has also brought protein to the forefront, as Americans have pushed to hold on to muscle mass while losing fat.\n\nProtein is also a crucial nutrient for longevity. As we get older, our muscle mass tends to naturally decline, which, if we're not careful, can lead to frailty and an increased risk of injury and illness. Eating enough protein as we age helps maintain muscle for more resilience and strength at age 60 and beyond.\n\nPrevious dietary guidelines focused on the bare minimum of protein you'd need to avoid malnutrition, which is around 0.36 grams per pound of body weight (about 54 grams per day for a 150-pound person).\n\nHowever, avoiding starvation is rarely the only goal of eating. Nutrition and exercise science suggest the optimal amount of protein for building muscle is about twice that amount, about 0.7 grams per pound daily (105 grams for a 150-pound person). In a day, that translates to about 30 to 35 grams per meal.\n\nToday, some top TikTokers log themselves eating more than 100 grams of protein at a single meal, and 300 or more grams in a day. Great, if you're the Rock.\n\nFor the rest of us, there's no reason to spend that extra time, money, and energy on all that protein, said Dr. Federica Amati, medical scientist and head nutritionist at the nutrition app ZOE.\n\n\"Definitely, I think it's overrated,\" she previously told Business Insider. \"The interest in protein isn't going anywhere because it's been ingrained, especially in the US culture.\"\n\nProtein has been a mainstay of American nutrition for well over four decades: from the Atkins era in the 70s, peaking in the early aughts, to current keto, low-carb, and carnivore diets. Along the way, food fads alternatively demonized dietary fats and carbs. For any health-conscious person, what else was left to eat but more and more protein?\n\nThe problem, according to Amati and others, is that protein is hogging the spotlight from other key nutrients that play a major role in our health.\n\n\"If you just focus on telling people you need to eat one gram of protein for a kilogram of body weight, then you don't know what else is going on the plate,\" Amati said.\n\nFiber, for instance, plays a crucial role in gut health, metabolism, and longevity. And you're far more likely to be missing out on fiber than protein, Amati said. Incidentally, the latest dietary guidelines put key sources of fiber, like beans and whole grains, near the bottom of the pyramid.\n\nEven for athletes, who need extra protein to recover from the strain of exercise, can get too much protein, cardiologist Dr. Dmitry Yaranov previously told Business Insider. Bodybuilders, for instance, look like the pinnacle of health, but \"end up with weak hearts and blocked arteries,\" he said.\n\nThe latest dietary guidelines recommend between 0.6 and 0.9 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily, between 90 and 135 grams for a 150-pound person.\n\nHowever, Amati said you don't need to track your grams of protein at all. If you simply must count your protein on a daily basis, she recommends calculating a percentage instead of the number of grams.\n\nIf you're eating around 2000 calories a day, 100 grams of protein would translate to about 20% of your diet, leaving the other 80% of your diet for more crucial nutrients.\n\n\"What the percentage helps us do is focus on the importance of a varied diet,\" she said.\n\nMeat makes up a large part of Kennedy's new vision of healthy eating in America (including our right to fries soaked in cattle fat), part of the comeback movement for dairy, butter, and other animal-based foods.\n\nBut red and processed meats (including trendy jerky snacks and deli meats) have consistently been linked to a higher risk of heart disease and some cancers.\n\nAmati said your best bet is focusing on variety in your diet. If you're eating a range of foods — including plant-based protein sources like beans, nuts, and seeds — you'll get all the essential amino acids you need, along with plenty of fiber, vitamins, and minerals.",

Mo Khanna know about it during a recent conversation.\n\nIn a post on X, the LinkedIn cofounder — and prominent Democratic donor — said Rep. Mo Khanna had reached out to discuss the proposed tax, which would impose a 5% tax on billionaires in the state of California. Hoffman called the proposal \"badly designed\" with \"massive flaws\" that would be \"horrendous\" for innovation.\n\n\"The proposed CA wealth tax is badly designed in so many ways that a simple social post cannot cover all of the massive flaws,\" Hoffman wrote. \"One well-documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal. Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.\"\n\nHe said that, after the conversation, he believes Khanna sees Silicon Valley as \"a massively important creation of the future,\" adding that the congressman wants to \"preserve and evolve capitalism\" through the proposed tax.\n\n\"It is true that we need to preserve and grow the incredible creation and generativity of Silicon Valley,\" Hoffman wrote. \"It is also true that we must figure out how to help people who have not benefited from the wealth, jobs, and company creation engine of Silicon Valley thus far.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Khanna wrote that he appreciated \"the excellent dialogue\" with Hoffman.\n\n\"You summarized my goal and aspiration correctly!\" Khanna said.\n\nSilicon Valley superstars have been split on the proposed wealth tax. Some prominent figures in tech, like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, have come out in support of the proposal, while others have sharply criticized it.\n\nGoogle's Larry Page moved several of his assets and his businesses out of the state ahead of an end-of-2025 deadline that would have risked exposing him to the proposed tax, Business Insider exclusively reported on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump singled out Raytheon on Wednesday in his sweeping criticism of the defense industry, threatening to cut the company's government contracts if it didn't invest \n\nTrump called out Raytheon by name after earlier saying he wouldn't allow defense firms to do buybacks or pay dividends until they speed up production. The president said Raytheon has been \"the least responsive\" to the government's needs, slow in increasing volume, and has prioritized returning capital to shareholders over the military's priorities.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government, Trump said in a Truth Social post.\n\nA spokesperson for RTX Corporation, formerly known as Raytheon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The company rebranded as RTX in 2023 following a merger with United Technologies Corporation.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump fired a broadside at the entire defense industry, posting on Truth Social that he would \"not permit\" further stock buybacks or dividends to be issued to shareholders. Trump also said that until defense companies build \"NEW and MODERN Production Plants\" their executives' pay should be capped at $5 million.\n\nLike its competitors, shares of RTX dropped after Trump's initial post about the industry. RTX rebounded in early after-hours trading, trending up more than 3% as of 6 p.m. ET.\n\nIt's unclear why Trump singled out Raytheon in particular. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders. Raytheon announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023 and says it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.\n\nLast year, the company paid out a dividend in March. It's unclear if Trump's statement will affect those plans or even the extent to which a president could prohibit a publicly traded company from fulfilling its previously declared financial obligations.\n\nTrump has frequently used the presidential bully pulpit to criticize companies and their CEOs. In August 2025, Trump called for Intel to fire its CEO Lip-Bu Tan, only to later change his stance after the US government acquired a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker.\n\nIt is less common for Trump to directly threaten a company's government contracts, although he has done so as well.\n\nIn July 2025, Trump threatened to cut off Elon Musk's companies from government contracts during a heated back-and-forth with the world's richest person. Since then, Trump has reconciled with the billionaire.",

    "title": "This Radar-Equipped Stove Shutoff Is One of the Most Practical Things I Saw at CES",
    "description": "The iGuard keeps seniors safe in the kitchen by reducing the chance of cooking fires.",
    "fullText": "Radar-based sensors seem to be having a moment at CES, especially in tech meant for people to keep tabs on their aging family members. One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove.\n\niGuard is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.\n\nA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on.\n\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.\n\nThe device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.\n\nA previous version, called the iGuardStove, used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.\n\nI’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuard has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended.\n\nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuard can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuard has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running.\n\nThe device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.\n\nWhile a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuard seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.\n\nUpdate 1/7/2025 at 7:48 a.m. PST: Corrected to note that the new product is named iGuard, and the previous version with motion sensors was iGuardStove.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "title": "15 Shows Like 'Stranger Things' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "These streaming shows will turn you Upside Down.",
    "fullText": "After a decade, Stranger Things is at an end. Well, I mean, except for planned animated and live-action spin-offs...and possibly an unlikely secret extra episode related to the 'Conformity Gate' theory; adherents are convinced that the whole thing we watched was just Vecna messing with our Hawkins crew. But the story that started way back in 2016 is mostly over, almost for sure! Given the pace of life these days, the end of the Obama administration feels, somehow, as distant as the series' nostalgic 1980s setting. The show solidified Netflix as the streamer to beat in terms of original programming, and introduced a new generation of child stars who are all now firmly adults. The show's blend of nostalgia, horror, and small-town weirdness has been wildly influential (and endlessly copied), but its success is based, also, on its synthesis and deft reworking of deeply familiar elements. In that spirit, here are a few shows of the past and present that, in various ways, carry some of those Stranger vibes.\n\nTravel to The Town (we never get a name for it), a palce from which no one can ever leave. The residents and visitors aren't metaphorically trapped, but literally so, as in the later seasons of Stranger Things, as they are beset by creatures come from the woods that kill anyone found outside after dark. The Matthews family learn all about this firsthand when they roll into the place in their RV and soon find themselves trapped alongside the local sheriff (Harold Perrineau) just as it's getting dark. The monsters here aren't just mindlessly hungry, they're cunning and sadistic, and more than capable of killing residents in gory ways. It's a supernatural spin on the \"small towns ain't what they seem\" vibe. Stream From on MGM+.\n\nSophia Lillis, straight from playing Beverly Marsh in the It movies, stars as Sydney Novak, a 17-year-old living in a small town with her mother and sister. Her father recently died by suicide; she has a crush on her best friend; and all she and her mother do is argue. In the middle of all of that, she discovers that she had powers triggered by her emotions, both of which she'll need to learn to control if she wants to get her life in order. As the lead, Lillis sells the hell out of this offbeat coming-of-age story which was canceled after one season. Because of course it was. Stream I Am Not Okay With This on Netflix.\n\nComplete tonal mismatch here aside, there are few stranger shows streaming right now than this weird sci-fi apocalypse from Breaking Bad's Vince Gilligan. Rhea Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, a fantasy romance author and general grouch who becomes one of only 13 people on the planet immune to the \"Joining\"—the result of an alien virus that transforms the rest of humanity into a peaceful, perky, and perpetually content hive mind. Carol refuses to surrender her miserableness in the face of a loss of identity, fighting instead to restore humanity to its admittedly cruddy ways. Thrilling, heartbreaking, and oddly funny, the show manages to address some big questions about what it means to be human, and what we'd be willing to give up to change. Stream Pluribus on Apple TV+.\n\nThere are few (if any) teens here, but Haven (based on the Stephen King short story \"The Colorado Kid\") has got the \"weird stuff goes down in a small town\" vibe down pat. Emily Rose stars as Audrey Parker, an FBI Special Agent sent to the title town of Haven, Maine on a routine case. Soon, she gets drawn into “the Troubles,\" a series of harmful supernatural events that have recurred throughout the town’s history—and, by no coincidence, are happening again. A supernatural-case-of-the-week format gives way to a bigger mystery when Audrey comes to learn that this isn’t her first time in Haven, nor the first time she’s encountered the Troubles. Lucas Bryant and Eric Balfour co-star. Stream Haven on Peacock and Prime Video.\n\nDark began as a mystery involving a missing child and evolved, over its three seasons, into a wildly complex narrative: a time travel-driven story that explores dark family secrets over the course of several generations. The German import has a striking look and incredibly atmospheric feel, with an ensemble cast of teens and adults whose narratives are deftly intertwined. Especially given the title, you'd be absolutely right to assume that the tone here is quite a bit more dark than that of Stranger Things, but the shows have plenty in common, including an interest in the '80s. Stream Dark on Netflix.\n\nNot a series, precisely, but a series of movies that play out like a miniseries (at least initially), and that play in the retro-nostalgia horror-vibe that Stranger Things does so well. Adapted from the R. L. Stine books, Fear Street Part One: 1994 kicks off the series by introducing the town of Shadyside, which the local kids call “Shittyside,” and has a dark history of multiple murders, most of them covered up. A group of teens upsets the grave of a witch, kicking off the revival of a murderous cult. There are some legit gore and scares (it’s YA, more or less, but definitely not kids’ stuff) as Janiak pays homage to a wide range of horror movies past. The series continues with an impeccable camp slasher homage in Fear Street Part Two: 1978, and then an origin tale that brings the initial trilogy to a conclusion in Fear Street Part Three: 1666. There's a standalone fourth film, as well, and more on the way, but you're fine sticking with the initial trilogy. Stream Fear Street Part One: 1994 on Netflix.\n\nThis would be the easiest possible recommendation for Stranger Things fans, were it not for the fact that the well-reviewed show was cancelled after one season (though it still ends with a fairly satisfying wrap up). Based on the pretty great comic book series from Brian K. Vaughan and Cliff Chiang, the show follows four young friends—Erin, Tiff, Mac, and KJ—on their paper route the morning after Halloween in 1988. After the skies turn pink and they're accosted by competing groups of weirdos, they head for the safety of Erin's house, only to discover they're suddenly in 2019. Made into targets by their inadvertent time travel, the girls have to stay alive while also deciding whether they want to take the chance to change their own timelines. Stream Paper Girls on Prime Video.\n\nA gorgeous-looking anthology (sort of), Tales From the Loop takes place in the small town of Mercer, Ohio—a town that happens to sit upon the titular Loop, a physics lab exploring mysteries for which science has no answers. Each episode offers the story of a person or family in the town impacted by the work of the Loop, in slow-burning stories about the intersection of technology and human existence. It’s based on a conceptual art book by artist Simon Stålenhag, and successfully ports over that book’s striking look and feel. It's far quieter and more meditative than something like Stranger Things, but worth your time if that's your mood. Stream Tales from the Loop on Prime Video.\n\nThe least buzzy of Mike Flanagan's Netflix offerings is every bit as good as Midnight Mass, The Fall of the House of Usher, et al. Based on the YA novel by Christopher Pike, it follows a group of eight terminally ill young patients at a bucolic hospice home run by a secretive and mysterious doctor (A Nightmare on Elm Street's Heather Langenkamp). Each night the kids meet secretly to share scary stories, with each also promising to return from beyond the grave when the time comes. Spooky and surprisingly moving, the show was planned as more than a miniseries, and the cancellation left some questions unanswered, but the ending is still pretty satisfying. Stream The Midnight Club on Netflix.\n\nTeens and adults in a deceptively quiet small town (in the '80s, no less) face tragedy accompanied by supernatural threats from outside of our normal space and time. That's a reasonably fair synopsis of both Stranger Things and Twin Peaks, but it also serves to obscure the massive tonal differences between the two shows. Kyle MacLachlan plays FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, who arrives in the title town to investigate the murder of teenager homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). His arrival in town precipitates a (very) long night of the soul as Cooper uncovers secrets and mysteries among the town's delightfully, and often disturbingly, weird residents. Stream Twin Peaks on Paramount+ or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThe Upside Down of Stranger Things is a dark, challenging, chaotic mirror to our own reality—so imagine a similarly sinister parallel space, now with a bit more obvious structure. Video-game obsessed Arisu gets his wish, after a fashion, when he finds himself, along with a couple of friends, transported to an alternate, eerily abandoned version of Tokyo—the title’s Borderland—vividly brought to life via some clever green screen work. The three are directed to an arena and given the instructions for the game, which they’ll be playing whether they want to or not. The first competition involves a locked-room-style puzzle; if they fail, the room goes up in flames with them in it—think Ready Player One, with deadlier stakes. There are games each night, though the rules allow for winners to get time off. There are a lot of rules, actually, but the games are cleverly and sadistically constructed. Stream Alice in Borderland on Netflix.\n\nPeyton List stars as Maddie, a teenager in small-town Wisconsin for whom her death is very much just the beginning. Stuck in a high school in the afterlife (because hell is definitely for children), she goes on a journey to solve her own murder while uncovering secrets and lies in both worlds. It all sounds a bit grim, but the show has a sense of fun about it: While Maddie does develop the ability to communicate with the living, her world is populated by ghost teens from various eras and generations, with customs, mores, and cliques having developed in ghost high school just as in our world. Stream School Spirits on Paramount+ or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nTaking a turn off of Fear Street, we return to R.L. Stine—who is, after all, our reigning master of YA horror (his name appearing on well over 300 books). In contrast with earlier adaptations, this series ditches the episodic anthology format of the 1990s series in favor of a more anthologized teen drama, probably in direct response to the popularity of Stranger Things. The first season is set in the present (while involving a mystery from the past), so skips the nostalgic charms (and traps) of the Netflix series, finding a modern group of teens in a weird town encountering the various monsters and scares (many of them legitimately freaky). Each season shifts the focus to a new story, with a new cast of actors in their mid-20s playing teens. Stream Goosebumps on Disney+.\n\nThis time-jumping survival drama is about a group of teenage girls becoming stranded in the wilderness in 1996 and doing terrible things to survive—the extent of which we only learn about via flashbacks from the present, where the events of those 19 months continue to have an impact. There are teases of the supernatural here, much of it ambiguous, but there's plenty of horror in a past that we're still seeing fleshed (ahem) out. Where Stranger Things revels in its '80s setting, Yellowjackets more cynically posits that there's a huge difference between the version of the past we talk about and the one that really happened. Stream Yellowjackets on Paramount+ (the first two seasons are also on Netflix) or you can buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThe much-loved, if relatively short-lived, animated series follows twin siblings Mabel and Dipper Pines (Kristen Schaal and Jason Ritter) sent to spend the summer with their great-uncle (aka \"Grunkle\") Stan (voiced by show creator Alex Hirsch). While helping Stan run his mystery-themed tourist shack, the kids run into a series of supernatural mysteries, many related to the show's ultimate antagonist, dream demon Bill Cipher. Like Stranger Things, the series came to a planned conclusion (albeit after four years rather than ten), and it's finale was similarly a ratings blockbuster—the highest rated telecast in the history of Disney XD, as a matter of fact. Stream Gravity Falls on Disney+ and Hulu.",

    "title": "Four Ways to Keep Your House Warm When the Heat Goes Out",
    "description": "It’s freezing outside and your power just went out—along with your furnace or boiler.",
    "fullText": "Living in a comfortable, heated house is something a lot of us take for granted. When the cold weather hits, we just put on thick socks, turn up the thermostat (or take other steps), and go about our business. But most modern homes rely on the electrical grid to keep that heat flowing. Even if your home is heated by natural gas or heating oil, there’s most likely an electric component to your heating system.\n\nThat means that when the power goes out—say, in the middle of a fierce blizzard—so does your heat. Even recently built homes can lose interior heat pretty quickly, dropping to uncomfortable (and even unsafe) temperatures within a day at most. If you’re not sure when power will be restored, you’ll need to find a way to keep the place as warm as possible if you and your property are going to come out of the experience unscathed. Here are are four ways to keep your house warm if your heat goes out.\n\nIf you have some warning that a power loss is possible during the cold months—a winter storm warning, for example—it’s a good idea to “pre-heat” your home. The warmer your house is when the power goes out, the longer it will remain at a safe and/or comfortable temperature. You don’t necessarily want to make it tropical, but a few degrees higher than usual will buy you some time if the power goes out. Combined with sealing the house as tightly as possible—by hanging thermal curtains or blankets over windows, applying plastic insulation kits to windows, and deploying draft stoppers under doorways and anywhere else cold air is getting in—this strategy can be very effective.\n\nTrying to keep a large house warm without an active heating system is a fool’s errand. Instead, focus on a single room where everyone in the house can gather, because a small room is a lot easier to warm up. A few considerations about which room to choose:\n\nSince heat rises, rooms on upper floors will be warmer than rooms on the main floor.\n\nA room that gets a lot of sunlight can be warmed during the day by opening up the curtains and letting that solar energy do its thing.\n\nSmaller rooms will be easier to heat up, but consider how many people will need to live and sleep in there.\n\nRooms near bathrooms (or with en-suite baths) offer a bit more convenience, especially if you’re going to be hunkering down for a while.\n\nOnce you’ve selected the room you’ll be using, try to keep it closed up as much as possible (covering windows, stopping up drafts, keeping the door closed). Introducing an indoor-safe heater is a good idea if you have one (or you can make one; see below).\n\nIf none of the rooms in your house are ideal, you could also consider setting up a tent indoors. Tents are designed to hold in heat, and can create a small, controllable environment that will be easier to keep warm in a pinch.\n\nIf you’ve planned ahead and have an indoor-safe propane or kerosene heater (or even a solar-powered portable heater), that will obviously help to keep your home warm (just be certain to follow all the instructions for ventilating whatever space you’re heating up). If you haven’t, or you discover that your propane tanks have leaked and you have no fuel, don’t despair. You can still generate heat by building a candle-pot heater, which is an old-school way of generating some quick heat.\n\nA candle-pot heater is pretty easy to set up: You’ll need 1-3 clay flower pots (or similar ceramic containers) in different sizes, some non-flammable materials to set up on (bricks or stone tiles will work), and some candles. Then arrange everything:\n\nSet up your bricks or other materials to create a raised platform, with plenty of airflow.\n\nPlace your smallest pot upside down on the bricks and cover the hole in the bottom (if it’s a flowerpot).\n\nPlace the larger pot on top, and then the largest on top of that if you have three pots.\n\nPlace your candles underneath and light them.\n\nThe candles don’t produce much heat, but the clay pots will absorb that heat and slowly start to radiate out. Instead of the candles’ heat just rising up to your ceiling and being cooled by the frigid air already in the room, the pots capture it and intensify it.\n\nWill this replace your home’s heating system, or even a portable propane heater? Not by a mile. But it will make a difference, especially in a small space.\n\nA few things to keep in mind here:\n\nCandles are open flames, so never leave your heater unattended, and always be conscious of fire hazards.\n\nYou can place a foil-covered panel behind the heater to help reflect the heat in a specific direction (say, toward the chair you’re sitting in).\n\nIf you have a gas furnace, it’s not that hard to keep it running even during a blackout if you have an alternative power source like a generator or even a power bank. The furnace needs electricity to run the ignition, the blower, and communication between the thermostat and the furnace or boiler. A decent generator or robust battery can definitely keep your furnace running for a while—and those extra hours or days could be crucial in an extended cold-weather blackout.\n\nIf you can see an obvious on/off switch on your furnace, you can pretty easily install a transfer switch like this one (here’s a video demonstrating how it’s done). This allows you to plug in a generator or power bank and keep your furnace running even when the power’s out—all you have to do is plug it in and flip the switch. If you’re not entirely comfortable with electrical wiring, you can hire a licensed electrician to install it as well, of course. Once it’s done, you’ll never have to worry about a cold house again—as long as you pair the switch with a generator or battery solution of sufficient power to keep things running.",

    "description": "Standard wheelchairs are less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that.",
    "fullText": "Wheelchairs are available at airports, hotels, resorts, theme parks, and on cruises, but standard wheelchairs require ongoing effort and can struggle through difficult terrain. Standard wheelchairs are simply less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that.\n\nWheelMove is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are. It debuted at CES 2026, marking a significant leap in accessibility for wheelchair users who travel.\n\nWhen I found WheelMove at CES \"Unveiled,\" I thought back to a recent family trip just two weeks ago, where two of my older family members often rented wheelchairs. They don't use wheelchairs in their day-to-day lives, but walking through a theme park all day wasn't possible. They needed support navigating the park, and the rest of us gladly took shifts pushing their wheelchairs. With a portable attachment like WheelMove, though, wheelchair users can use less effort and enjoy more independence through the battery-powered, remote-controlled attachment.\n\nRiders simply attach WheelMove to the front of any standard wheelchair, and the device lifts the wheelchair's smaller front wheels off the ground. Once attached, the rider controls the WheelMove through a basic remote control on their armrest, thigh, or wherever is most comfortable. The attachment weighs under 20 pounds, including its 10-inch wheel, 250W motor, and a battery that goes about 15 miles on a charge. Carrying an additional battery can double its range before needing to recharge, and it can navigate terrains including gravel, grass, and uneven surfaces like cobblestone.\n\nWheelMove is an incredibly innovative assistive technology poised to broaden personal mobility for those who need it, and it's also one of the finalists for the official Best of CES 2026 awards for the travel category. Pre-orders are available in France where the start-up is based, but the founders plan to expand internationally later this year. It costs about €5,000 or $6,000.",

    "description": "Tired of all the Microsoft AI slop? You can remove it entirely.",
    "fullText": "Some people love AI. If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.\n\nIf you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out \nRemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).\n\nTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\n\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n\nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.",

    "description": "This privacy feature keeps users in a single app.",
    "fullText": "There are likely occasions in your day-to-day life in which you allow someone else to use your phone, whether it's letting your kid play a game or sharing content with a friend. You may do this without thinking about the privacy implications and what might happen if another person has access to everything on your device and—accidentally or on purpose—uses it to view your search history, scroll through your photos, or send messages to your contacts.\n\nIf you're an Android user, you should enable app pinning to keep others from snooping around your device. This feature keeps the user in the pinned app until you enter your PIN, pattern, or password. (On iOS, you can achieve a similar effect with Guided Access, which also allows you to set time limits and disable the keyboard and touch input.)\n\nTo pin apps, you'll need to enable the feature in your phone's Settings app. To do so, go to Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and toggle on Use app pinning and Ask for PIN before unpinning.\n\nBefore handing your phone over, open to the app screen you want to pin, then swipe up to the middle of the screen and hold to open your Overview. Tap the app's icon, then tap Pin. This will keep the user locked into that app until you unpin (using your PIN, pattern, or password).\n\nDepending on your device navigation settings, there are a few ways to unpin an app:\n\nGesture navigation: Swipe up and hold\n\n2-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + Home\n\n3-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + Overview\n\nNote that pinning won't prevent someone from using the app fully, such as swiping through your photos or typing in the search bar, as Android doesn't have the option to disable touch. Pinned apps can also open other apps. At the very least, though, it keeps someone from having access to anything and everything on your device.",

    "title": "How 'Cognitive Overload' Might Be Hampering Your Productivity",
    "description": "Our brains simply aren't built to handle this much stimulation.",
    "fullText": "I write a lot about productivity, which means I also read a lot about it. Over the last few months, I've noticed an uptick in people discussing something called \"cognitive overload,\" citing it as a potential reason for a decline in output. The phrase stuck out to me as one of those buzzy terms that has the potential to be overused until it's meaningless—but at its core, it certainly has a real, clear definition that can be helpful tool in maximizing productivity.\n\nBasically, cognitive overload is what happens when you're inundated with more information than your brain can process, so your brain just gives up altogether, making hard to focus on anything at all. Here's what to know about it and what to do once you identify it.\n\nYou know all those jokes on social media about how a single news item or food product from modern times would kill a person born just a few centuries ago? They're funny and hyperbolic, but they're grounded in the fact that while the ways in which we produce things and share information have advanced wildly, the human brain has basically remained the same. We say it all the time but it bears repeating: We're just not cut out to handle the onslaught of stimuli we get on a daily basis.\n\nThink of how many times your phone lights up on a given day. I just checked my screentime app and discovered that though it's only early afternoon, I've gotten 150 notifications straight to my lock screen already today. It's only Wednesday, so I'm averaging 213 a day, which my phone assures me is down 20% from last week and I'm quite sure I'll pick back up by the time Sunday rolls around. Considering that a few months ago, I redid all my phone settings so not all of my notifications got blasted to my lock screen, this is concerning. That's just a lot of information to constantly see.\n\nAs it turns out, text-based info is the main cause of cognitive overload, at least according to one study. Emails, Slack and Teams messages, texts, calendar notifications—the never-ending stream of these bad boys is a major contributor to the overall feeling of being unable to process or do anything. If you think about an average day when you've felt too zapped to work, it probably included plenty of those. Audio-visual stimuli are less debilitating, according to the study, so a Zoom or phone call or a manager stopping by your desk may not trip you up as badly.\n\nBeyond feeling like you can't even think straight or like you're too overwhelmed to take action on any one task, you may be able to recognize cognitive overload from other signs. If incoming messages make you feel frustrated or detached, for instance, no matter what they say, this could be happening to you. That's actually the symptom I experience most often, for what it's worth. When I'm overwhelmed by too much information, I find myself thinking, \"What do you want?!\" every time my phone lights up, before I even see who is reaching out. (Sorry, Mom.)\n\nAs I was going through the study and thinking over cognitive overload, I realized I've already been implementing a few tricks that may have been helping me avoid it. As mentioned above, I banned my least-used apps from sending me notifications a few months ago. For years, I've also tinkered with my MacBook settings so I don't get any form of push notification on my computer. My phone is next to me at all times; there's no good reason for the top right corner of my laptop screen to be whacking me with the same notifications the phone is already showing me.\n\nA few other tried-and-true productivity approaches came to mind for me once I got a good grasp of what cognitive overload actually is. The one-touch rule of inbox management could be useful for you if you find that messages get you worked up. With that, you open each message as you get it and make an instant decision about what to do with the contents. It might seem counterintuitive to face each incoming message head-on if you're trying to avoid feeling burned out by the sheer volume of them, but I've found that when I see a message preview at the top of my screen and do nothing about it, it nags at me all day. Addressing it instantly helps me clear my mind and keep working.\n\nOtherwise, the way you go about battling this is going to be pretty subjective, although I do have one more recommendation: If you're not familiar with the Pomodoro technique, get familiar now. With it, you work for a set amount of time (usually 25 minutes) before taking a small break (usually five). When you're in those focus sessions, you should be completely distraction-free, putting your devices in Do Not Disturb mode or even using specialized apps to block other, distracting apps. Knowing you have to work seriously for a certain amount of time can help get you in the zone and push you away from information and decision paralysis while knowing you eventually get a break can help you stay relaxed as you go.",

Where do we put our spend into and what do we actually need?\"\n\nHarlequins saw off competition from Sale to retain England back-five forward Chandler Cunningham-South on a new contract in November, while Northampton full-back George Furbank is expected to move to the Twickenham Stoop for the start of next season.\n\nBristol second row James Dun has also been confirmed as a new arrival for 2026-27.\n\nFormer captain Stephen Lewies has been linked with a return to his native South Africa, external when his present deal expires at the end of the season, but Gilmore suggested other departures may be necessary as he looks for a smaller squad, combining quality and flexibility.\n\n\"You obviously need the right amount of contracts across all positions so that if you do get injuries, it's not like you're scrambling,\" he added.\n\n\"But what we're looking at is, can we be more efficient with our contracting?\"\n\nHarlequins have lost a host of big-name players in recent seasons, with the retirement of Joe Marler, Danny Care and Matt Symons coinciding with the departures of Andre Esterhuizen, Will Collier, Wilco Louw and Joe Marchant.\n\nGilmore said he was focused on reviving Harlequins' trademark attacking style, while emphasising the need for physicality in defence.\n\n\"How much are we prepared to fight?\" he added.\n\n\"It's just not about being on the back foot, it's about arresting momentum in the game and making sure that we keep on top.\"\n\nFlanker Jack Kenningham came through the club's academy, having been a regular at the Stoop as a boy.\n\n\"I put my body on the line every time I play for Quins - I love the club,\" said the 26-year-old.\n\n\"It means a lot to me, having been a season-ticket holder when I was about 11 years old. So it hurts me probably, potentially more than others when we do lose.\"",

With draws against Sunderland, Chelsea and now Brighton, they have so far not been up to the test.\n\nIf Arsenal beat Liverpool on Thursday, City will be eight points off the top with 17 games to play.\n\n\"The result is the result,\" said Guardiola. \"One point for them, one point for us. It is what it is.\n\n\"The second half was quite similar against Sunderland and Chelsea - we missed the passes.

Oh, and Wonkeeland on the BR map will become Cartmanland.\nUsing a short film to reveal the collab is something that Fortnite recently also did for its Simpsons-themed season in November--a Fortnite collaboration being something else that The Simpsons did before Butters could.

    "description": "The program allows patients in the state to get prescription refills for 190 common meds.",
    "fullText": "The state of Utah is allowing artificial intelligence to prescribe medication refills to patients without direct human oversight in a pilot program public advocates call “dangerous.”\n\nThe program is through the state’s “regulatory sandbox” framework, which allows businesses to trial “innovative” products or services with state regulations temporarily waived. The Utah Department of Commerce partnered with Doctronic, a telehealth startup with an AI chatbot.\n\nDoctronic offers a nationwide service that allows patients to chat with its “AI doctor” for free, then, for $39, book a virtual appointment with a real doctor licensed in their state. But patients must go through the AI chatbot first to get an appointment.\n\nAccording to a non-peer-reviewed preprint article from Doctronic, which looked at 500 telehealth cases in its service, the company claims its AI’s diagnosis matched the diagnosis made by a real clinician in 81 percent of cases. The AI’s treatment plan was “consistent” with that of a doctor’s in 99 percent of the cases.\n\nNow, for patients in Utah, Doctronic’s chatbot can refill a prescription without a doctor, for a $4 service fee . After a patient signs in and verifies state residency, the AI chatbot can pull up the patient’s prescription history and offer a list of prescription medications eligible for a refill. According to Politico, the chatbot will only be able to renew prescriptions for 190 common medications for chronic conditions, with key exclusions, such as medications for pain and ADHD, and those that are injected.\n\nThe first 250 renewals for each drug class will be reviewed by real doctors, but after that, the AI chatbot will be on its own. Adam Oskowitz, Doctronic co-founder and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, told Politico that the AI chatbot is designed to err on the side of safety and escalate any case with uncertainty to a real doctor.\n\n“Utah’s approach to regulatory mitigation strikes a vital balance between fostering innovation and ensuring consumer safety,” Margaret Woolley Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nFor now, it’s unclear if the Food and Drug Administration will step in to regulate AI prescribing. On the one hand, prescription renewals are a matter of practicing medicine, which falls under state governance. However, Politico notes that the FDA has said that it has the authority to regulate medical devices used to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.\n\nIn a statement, Robert Steinbrook, health research group director at watchdog Public Citizen, blasted Doctronic’s program and the lack of oversight. “AI should not be autonomously refilling prescriptions, nor identifying itself as an ‘AI doctor,'” Steinbrook said.\n\n“Although the thoughtful application of AI can help to improve aspects of medical care, the Utah pilot program is a dangerous first step toward more autonomous medical practice,” he said.\"The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies cannot look the other way when AI applications undermine the essential human clinician role in prescribing and renewing medications.”",

The update adds operator skins for characters from Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show, and there are plenty of limited-time game modes and events themed around the series.\n\nThis Fallout event includes free and paid event passes filled with rewards, and you can see all the skins and more details here. Nuketown also gets a special \"Vault Town\" map variant, which includes a Nuka Cola bus, vault suits for the mannequins, and other decor themed around Fallout. Make sure to check out all the details for Season 1 Reloaded in Black Ops 7 and Warzone, including more weapons, multiplayer maps, and new Zombies content.\n\nBelow, we highlight all the new Fallout-themed game modes players can enjoy. This includes modes for multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and even the campaign's Endgame.\n\nIn the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Mayhem playlist, Black Ops 7's multiplayer maps are irradiated with toxic particles. These are 6v6 matches of Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint, and they feature \"S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs\" to help players keep their radiation at safe levels. The HUD features a Geiger counter to display exposure levels, and players will want to collect the buffs to avoid taking too much radiation damage.\n\nThe S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs include:\n\nThe Ghouls is a spin on Call of Duty's Infected mode. In this mode, players spawn into the match as Vault Dwellers on irritated multiplayer maps. They must scavenge for perks and RadAway to help them survive, and each eliminated Vault Dweller returns to the match as a ghoul fighting against the dwellers. Players must survive as Vault Dweller or infect everyone as a ghoul to win.\n\nThe Feral Ghouls and Deathclaws of Fallout invade both the Ashes of the Damned and Astra Malorum maps in this themed limited-time mode. In Project RADs, players are also exposed to increased levels of radiation with each passing round.\n\nThis changes the mode's usual means of healing and earning Essence. Instead, these are replaced with a system of drops given by fallen enemies that assist the crew in keeping rad levels at bay and gaining vital resources.\n\nWhile it's not exactly an LTM, players can hunt down Fallout's infamous Deathclaws in Endgame. Deathclaws can be found in matches as a limited-time world event. For this event, a bomb blast reduces a portion of Avalon into a Fallout-inspired wasteland with toxic air. Players can fight through hordes of feral ghouls to take on a Deathclaw hunt for rewards.\n\nPower Armor Royale is a Fallout-themed spin on battle royale. This features 66 players in trios on Verdansk, where power armor can be obtained from air drops. Players will need to charge up Fusion Cores in order to use any power armor, but the suit will grant the user a health boost, jetpack thrusters, upgraded weaponry, and the ability to eject and detonate the suit.",

    "fullText": "Some HSBC mobile banking customers in the UK report being locked out of the bank's app after installing the Bitwarden password manager via an open source app catalog.\n\nNeil Brown, board member at F-Droid, said he was blocked from accessing HSBC's UK mobile banking after a security screen flagged Bitwarden as a risk. Brown had installed the password manager via F-Droid rather than Google Play.\n\nBitwarden, an open source password manager, is available through official channels including Google Play and Galaxy stores, as well as via F-Droid sideloading.\n\nHSBC didn't provide The Register with a clear answer on why it won't allow a sideloaded Bitwarden installation to coexist with its app on the same device.\n\nRepresentatives from both F-Droid and Bitwarden suspect the issue stems from HSBC's side.\n\nGary Orenstein, chief customer officer at Bitwarden, told us: \"It seems that HSBC has chosen a level of security and permissions for their mobile app that allows the HSBC app to see if there are other apps on the phone not installed from the Google Play store, and if one is found, to disallow the install of the HSBC app.\"\n\nBrown said that \"as far as I know, this is a decision taken by HSBC unilaterally,\" and the issues are not caused by F-Droid itself.\n\nSome have opined that HSBC configured its app safety controls, Play Integrity, to forbid operation in such cases, although this remains unconfirmed.\n\n\"In terms of the technical details, I do not know,\" Brown told us. \"It could be down to SafeNet, but I do not know for sure. There might be technical workarounds, such as using banking apps within a separate profile on the device. Or – not ideal, because of the increased cost for the user – using a separate physical device for banking apps.\"\n\n\"My approach, driven by me testing postmarketOS, is to switch back from using apps to using the provider's website.\"\n\nHSBC's response gave little away. A spokesperson said: \"Protecting our customers' accounts and personal information is our priority. Our app performs checks to identify potential malware risks and can require users to take additional steps to keep their accounts safe.\"\n\nBoth Bitwarden and F-Droid said they are open to discussing the matter with the bank, although we understand no meetings have yet been scheduled. ®",

    "description": "The Elder Scrolls Online in 2026 will look quite different from previous years, as developer ZeniMax Online Studios goes all-in on the game's new seasonal model that will see all of the game's content updates arrive free of charge.\nFor years, ESO has followed a familiar, fairly typical MMO pattern of yearly paid chapter (expansion) releases. Those new chapters added new regions of Tamriel for players to explore, additional story content, optional paid DLCs, and, occasionally, things like new classes and systems.\nZeniMax Online announced in 2024 that going forward, ESO wouldn't have a traditional yearly chapter release, labeling 2025 as a \"transitional\" year as the team prepared to focus on its plans for 2026. In a recent livestream and subsequent press Q&A attended by GameSpot, the developers have now revealed what ESO's 2026 will look like, and it includes more experimental seasonal content, battle passes, new story content, solo dungeons, a PvP progression system, class reworks, and more.",

However, it might still \"be a while\" until the feature is ready.\nWhile cross-play has long been something ZeniMax Online has said it wants to do and has explored options for, this is the first time the developer has confirmed it's actually happening, though there is not yet a clear idea of when, exactly, the feature will arrive.\n\"Cross-play is definitely coming, but it's going to be a while,\" ESO executive Susan Kath said as part of a virtual Q&A attended by GameSpot ahead of the game's 2026 preview livestream. \"Just to set the stage on that.",

    "description": "John...",
    "fullText": "Her victory was won by the precariat: renters, transit riders, and democratic socialists who rallied, rang doorbells, created social media, and registered new voters.\n\nA day after Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration, 3,000 miles west of New York, the people of Seattle celebrated their own democratic socialist miracle, swearing in Mayor Katie Wilson. Katie beat the odds in unseating a powerful incumbent with an agenda rooted in equity and an authenticity that appealed to the city’s most precarious voters.\n\nI was lucky enough to be among the speakers at Wilson’s inauguration, which, unlike Mamdani’s, was purposefully not star-studded. There were very few suits. Mayor Wilson’s clothes were purchased at Goodwill. One thousand Seattleites crowded into City Hall, hundreds of whom had never thought of it as their home. Along with me, Katie invited three speakers who presented a mosaic of hope: a Somali American graduate student, a formerly homeless man, and an elder who reminded us over and over again to be courageous and not content.\n\nWhile Zohran was sworn in by Senator Bernie Sanders, Katie was sworn in by Pauline Van Senus, a low-income transit rider known as Seattle’s “transit fairy” for cleaning bus stops throughout the city.\n\nKatie’s victory was won by the precariat: renters, transit riders, and democratic socialists who rallied around Katie, rang doorbells for her, created dominant social media, and registered new voters.\n\nThese are not the recognized power brokers of Seattle, but Katie’s win shows they can mobilize and inspire the grassroots to elect a mayor who embraces working-class values and policy that will enable residents to thrive—including affordable childcare, transit, and housing.\n\nNow the challenge Katie faces is to universalize childcare and social housing. In previous decades, progressives have tried to create progress with incremental victories in an overwhelmingly powerful corporate context. I know this work firsthand as a longtime advocate for progressive economic policy. I’ve seen the pitfalls of this approach. It is time for fundamental, systemic, and universal progress for Seattle. Katie can bring it.\n\nIt won’t be easy, as the Trump administration and Congress are stripping funding from social services such as childcare and healthcare. Though Seattle has the means to fund these social goods, we are about to find out if our leaders have the political gumption to tax the oligarchs, the affluent, and the global corporations headquartered in Seattle, including Amazon and Starbucks.\n\nKatie has never shied away from confronting corporate power. Her first stop after the election was at a Starbucks picket line, where she proclaimed, “I’m not buying Starbucks and you should not either.” It’s not just lip service: Katie originated the JumpStart tax on large corporations.\n\nWith the election of three progressives, she now has allies on the City Council. She has built a grassroots movement that could be engaged in initiative campaigns if the City Council refuses to act. That’s how we may end up building our city. As Katie’s swearing-in ceremony demonstrated beautifully, Seattle’s new mayor has built a coalition of community organizations, workers, activists, immigrants, Democrats, socialists, childcare workers, and small businesses to win her election. Now that coalition must be plugged into actual policy advancement.\n\nKatie’s platform is about more than creating a thriving economic community. It’s also about setting the conditions that allow everyday people to enjoy the simple pleasures of life—to walk in a park, to have time to read a book. Watching Mamdani’s swearing-in from Seattle, I was moved to tears as Lucy Dacus sang “Bread and Roses.” In Seattle, Katie, echoing these lyrics, affirmed that we must open up “the time and space where life happens, where people can breathe and experience and create, where we can be full human beings and not just means to an end.… Because we need bread, but we need roses too. We deserve roses.”",

    "fullText": "Darren Michael, associate professor at Austin Peay State University, has reportedly been reinstated and given $500,000 after being fired over posts about assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nTennessee’s WKRN News 2 obtained a copy of a settlement agreement between Michael and the university, showing the school will dish out $500,000 and reimburse “therapeutic counseling services.”\n\n“APSU agrees to issue a statement acknowledging regret for not following the tenure termination process in connection with the Dispute,” the settlement reportedly reads. “The statement will be distributed via email through APSU’s reasonable communication channels to faculty, staff, and students.”\n\nThe university confirmed to WZTV in Nashville that Michael returned to his faculty position at the end of December.\n\nMichael was fired on Sept. 12 (two days after the assassination of Kirk) after social media posts about Kirk spread far and wide on social media.\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) brought attention to one post and included Michael’s photo and biography.\n\n“What do you say, [Augstin Peay]?” she wrote.\n\nWhat do you say, @austinpeay? pic.twitter.com/dTgCe4iv5l\n\n— Marsha Blackburn (@VoteMarsha) September 12, 2025\n\n“Charlie Kirk says gun deaths are ‘unfortunately’ worth it to keep 2nd Amendment,” read the headline of an article Michael shared. He did not add any additional comment on it.\n\nThe school originally said Michael was fired over “insensitive comments” made on social media.\n\n“Such actions do not align with Austin Peay’s commitment to mutual respect and human dignity,” APSU President Mike Licari said in a statement. “The university deems these actions unacceptable and has terminated the faculty member.”\n\nLicari acknowledged in a new statement that the school did not follow proper procedures in regards to Michael.\n\n“APSU did not follow the required termination process in this matter, and I deeply regret and apologize for the impact this has had on Professor Michael and on our campus community,” the university president said. “I am committed to ensuring that due process and fairness are upheld in all future actions.”\n\nThe post Professor Fired for Charlie Kirk Post Gets $500,000 From School, Is Reinstated first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "The U.S. Navy has some of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Its newest addition is named after an important World War II ship.",
    "fullText": "The United States Navy has the largest fleet of nuclear submarines on the planet, and it just added a new one to the inventory. This new fifth generation submarine is an incredible machine, and it was named in honor of one of World War II's biggest and best vessels. On December 15, 2025, the U.S. Navy took ownership of the USS Idaho (SSN-799). The ship was named to carry on the honor of the battleship USS Idaho (BB-42), which was first commissioned in 1919 and went on to be awarded seven battle stars during WWII.\n\nThe new Idaho is the 26th Virginia-class boat. The ship is the fifth U.S. Navy vessel to carry the name \"Idaho. The first was a wooden steam sloop that was turned into a full-rigged sailing ship commissioned in 1866. The second was the BB-24, a Mississippi-class battleship. During World War I, motorboat SP-545 also carried the name before \"Idaho\" was transferred to a New Mexico-class battleship of WWII. That warship was known as \"The Big Spud\" for the state's most famous crop.\n\nIt's common for the U.S. Navy to reuse ship names in honor of historical vessels. The most well-known example is probably the USS Enterprise, as there have been nine thusly-named vessels, three of which are aircraft carriers. The new USS Idaho will undergo a series of sea trials prior to its official commissioning, which will likely take place sometime in the spring of 2026. In the meantime, dedicated submariners will get to know the boat, which is expected to help strengthen the nation's undersea warfare capabilities.\n\nThe USS Idaho (SSN-799) is one of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Virginia-class subs are designated to be attack platforms with the capability to launch cruise missiles. They're used primarily for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering, and they can operate in blue-water oceans as well as in littoral areas along coastlines. The class is slowly replacing the cruise-missile variant of the Ohio class and other nuclear submarines in the Los Angeles class.\n\nAs of this writing, three Virginia-class boats are earmarked for the Royal Australian Navy, while the rest remain with the U.S. Navy. The USS Idaho measures 377 feet long with a displacement of 10,200 tons of seawater when submerged. The boat utilizes an S9G reactor alongside an auxiliary diesel engine and has a maximum speed of around 29 mph. Like other vessels of its class, the Idaho will be home to 128 enlisted personnel and 17 officers.\n\nBecause the boat is powered by nuclear energy, it has virtually an unlimited range and will likely remain in service for at least 40 years. In terms of armament, the USS Idaho features two Virginia Payload Tubes and four additional payload tubes capable of firing the BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile. Additionally, it features four 21-inch torpedo tubes to fire the U.S. Navy's MK-48 heavy torpedo.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth aggressively jumped in to cut off Secretary of State Marco Rubio to yell at a reporter on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe two Cabinet members had just come out of a meeting to brief senators on the U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and explain the path forward.\n\nRubio had been taking a series of questions from reporters when he was asked about how much involvement in Venezuela would cost U.S. taxpayers before being cut off.\n\nThe secretary of state insisted it would not cost the U.S. any money and claimed the oil deal would not either.\n\n“None of these troops sit in a dry dock waiting for action,” Rubio said. “They’re deployed somewhere in the world. If they’re not here, they’re somewhere else.”\n\nHe argued that if the ships were not in the Caribbean, they would be ”somewhere else conducting activity.”\n\nHegseth had been standing by, at times smirking, as Rubio spoke, but then he stepped forward, forcing the Secretary of State to shift aside, so he could chime in.\n\n“I want to emphasize that question from CNN,” Hegseth said, glaring at the reporter Manu Raju before launching a verbal attack.\n\n“The questions never asked how much does it cost when they’re in the Mediterranean, or the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean or the Pacific, but now that they’re in our hemisphere and a counter cartel mission or ensuring an indicted individual comes to justice, now now you’re asking the question of cost,” Hegseth raged, gesturing his hand for emphasis. “It’s a disingenuous question to begin with.”\n\nBut the defense secretary did not stop there as he continued to rant at the reporter who tried to respond.\n\n“You’re trying to find any angle possible to undermine the success of one of the most historic military missions the world has ever seen,” Hegseth declared.\n\nThe defense secretary went on to claim that the operation in Venezuela was one that only the U.S. could accomplish and argued the world is “taking notice of that.”\n\nHe went on to tout the seizure of oil tankers being pursued by the U.S.\n\nWhile Rubio had been taking questions, Hegseth ignored follow-up attempts from reporters and instead spoke louder.\n\n“Our military is prepared to continue this as he said,” Hegseth said, gesturing back to Rubio. “The president when he speaks, he means it, means it. He’s not messing around. We’re an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”\n\nHe then quickly stepped back without taking a single question as Rubio pointed out that the officials needed to go brief members of the House.\n\nHegseth ignored questions and beat a hasty retreat as questions were yelled about whether the U.S. would put boots on the ground and more.\n\nBefore the defense secretary’s rant in front of the cameras, Rubio attempted to lay out the Trump administration’s plan for Venezuela and insisted that, despite criticism, they’re not just winging it.\n\nHe outlined that stabilizing the country relied heavily on the “quarantine” as leverage and execution of a deal to take the oil out of Venezuela. He repeated the claim that the U.S. would take out 30 to 50 million barrels of oil and sell it.\n\n“That money would then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime,” Rubio argued.\n\nThe secretary of state said the second phase would be making sure the U.S. has access to the Venezuelan market that’s “fair.” He said the third phase would be the transition. He did not provide a timeline.\n\nDemocratic senators coming out of the briefing slammed the Trump administration’s plan and warned many questions were left unanswered.\n\n“This is an insane plan. They are talking about stealing the Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time undefined as leverage to micromanage the country,” said Senator Chris Murphy. “The scope and insanity of that plan is absolutely stunning.”",

    "description": "Taiwan is searching for a missing F-16 fighter jet and pilot after an incident earlier this week.",
    "fullText": "A Taiwanese F-16 fighter jet and its pilot went missing off the island's northeast coast on Tuesday.\n\nTaiwan's Air Force has grounded its F-16 fleet and suspended training missions in response.\n\nSearch and rescue operations are still ongoing. Right now, it's unclear whether the pilot ejected.\n\nTaiwan's air force has grounded its F-16 fleet and suspended training missions on the jet after one of the planes and the pilot went missing earlier this week.\n\nThe search continues for the pilot and aircraft, which officials believe went down following an in-flight \"anomaly,\" but rough seas off the island have made efforts difficult.\n\nOn Tuesday night local time, an American-made F-16 fighter jet assigned to the Taiwan Air Force's Fifth Tactical Air Wing operating out of Hualien Air Base went missing in the waters off the northeast coast of the island. The Air Force said the fighter was separated from a group during a nighttime training session after the jets entered cloud cover.\n\nThe F-16 suddenly descended quickly. Its altitude was just 1,700 feet when radar contact was lost. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has identified the missing pilot as Capt. Hsin Po-yi. Officials remain unsure whether Hsin successfully ejected from the aircraft, although he had indicated he would eject seconds before the aircraft disappeared. It's unclear if he did.\n\nIn the days since the incident, a search and rescue mission has been ongoing in the waters off Hualien County. Multiple aircraft and vessels have been involved in the mission, but tall waves and strong winds have been complicating the search for the jet and Hsin.\n\nAir Force officials told reporters during a press conference on Wednesday that there appeared to be a malfunction of the F-16's main onboard computer in which the aircraft's flight path was no longer displayed.\n\nNow, Taiwanese air force officials have grounded all of Taiwan's F-16 fleet for inspections, and training missions have been temporarily suspended. Taiwan currently has about 140 F-16s, the older A/B models, that it has upgraded in recent years. It is expected to receive a batch of the newer F-16V or Viper jets in the coming years to add to its fleet.\n\nThe F-16 is made by American defense giant Lockheed Martin. Though it's been flying for over 50 years, it still represents a highly capable fourth-generation jet. The newest operator of the aircraft is Ukraine, which received a limited number from NATO partner nations.\n\nThis crash involving the Taiwanese military follows a similar incident that occurred in January 2022, when a Taiwanese F-16 went down off the island's west coast while taking part in training exercises. At the time, the F-16 went missing after taking off from Chiayi Air Base in southern Taiwan. In response, Taiwan suspended its combat training for the fleet.\n\nIt's not uncommon to see fleets grounded after accidents, especially if the cause is unclear. The US military has done this regularly.\n\nTaiwan's Air Force has been strained in recent years by constant scrambling to track Chinese military aircraft, which regularly fly into the country's air defense identification zone. Taipei's smaller air force has experienced higher operational tempos that have exhausted pilots, aircraft, and resources and stressed maintainers. Most recently, Taiwan held rapid response drills in reaction to China's massive exercises nearby.",

    "title": "Common food preservatives linked to cancer and type 2 diabetes",
    "description": "Two large studies found a significant association between eating preservatives in many foods and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and several cancers.",
    "fullText": "Common preservatives used to keep food safe and extend shelf life may be linked to a higher risk of several cancers and type 2 diabetes, according to two new studies from France.\n\n“These are very important findings for preservatives that are not only widely used in the French and European markets, but also in the United States,” said senior author Mathilde Touvier, principal investigator of the NutriNet-Santé study used to conduct the research.\n\nThe NutriNet-Santé study, which began in 2009, compares over 170,000 participants’ web-based reports on diet and lifestyle with their medical data stored in the French national health care system.\n\n“These are the two first studies in the world investigating the associations between exposure to these food additives and cancer and type 2 diabetes,” said Touvier, who is also the director of research at France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris, “and so we must be very cautious about the message. Obviously, the results need to be confirmed.”\n\nDespite those caveats, “the concern raised about preservatives is one more reason among many to emphasize the personal and public health importance of fresh, whole, minimally processed foods, mostly plants,” Dr. David Katz said in an email.\n\nKatz, who was not involved in the study, is a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.\n\nThe cancer study, published Wednesday in The BMJ journal, closely examined the impact of 58 preservatives on some 105,000 people who were free of cancer in 2009 and were followed for up to 14 years. Only those who completed frequent 24-hour, brand-specific food questionnaires were included. People who ate the most preservative-laced food were compared with those who ate the least.\n\nResearchers did a deep dive on 17 preservatives consumed by at least 10% of the participants and found 11 of those had no relationship with cancer. However, the six that were linked to cancer are considered GRAS, or “generally recognized as safe” in food by the US Food and Drug Administration. Those include sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, sorbates, potassium metabisulfite, acetates and acetic acid.\n\nSodium nitrite, a chemical salt commonly used in processed meats such as bacon, ham and deli meats, was associated with a 32% increase in the risk of prostate cancer. It’s cousin, potassium nitrate, was associated with a 22% higher risk of breast cancer and a 13% increase in all cancers. The World Health Organization has long considered processed meat as a carcinogen, with a direct link to colon cancer.\n\nSorbates, especially potassium sorbate, were associated with a 26% higher risk for breast cancer and a 14% increase in all types of cancers. These water-soluble salts are used in wine, baked goods, cheeses and sauces to prevent molds, yeast and some bacteria.\n\nPotassium metabisulfite, often used in winemaking and brewing, was associated with a 20% increase in breast cancer and 11% higher risk of all cancers, according to the study.\n\nAcetates, which come from natural fermentation and are used in foods such as meat, sauces, breads and cheese, were linked to a 25% higher risk of breast cancer and 15% increase in cancer in general. Acetic acid, the main ingredient in vinegar, was associated with a 12% increase in the risk of all cancers, the study found.\n\nOther types of preservatives — antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, plant extracts like rosemary and such synthetic preservatives as butylated hydroxyanisole — were also studied. While these more “natural” preservatives are often linked to lower cancer risk when eaten as whole foods, they may be harmful when used as additives, Touvier said.\n\n“The hypothesis here is when you isolate one substance from its original matrix of a whole fruit or vegetable, the action on our health can be different depending on the way our gut microbiota will digest it,” she said.\n\nOnly two antioxidant preservatives were linked to cancer, the study found. Sodium erythorbate and other erythorbates, which are made from fermented sugars, were associated with a 21% higher incidence of breast cancer and 12% increase in cancer overall.\n\nErythorbates are used to prevent discoloration and spoilage in poultry, soft drinks and baked goods, to name a few. Sodium erythorbate is often used in processed meats to speed up the curing process.\n\nObservational studies are subject to error due to the lack of control over variables that might also influence outcomes. However, a major strength of this study was its ability to adjust for preservatives from natural sources and other food additives as well as its “detailed assessment of preservative intake, through repeated 24-hour dietary records,” according to an editorial published with the study.\n\n“We also looked at what colleagues have published on the impact of these preservative chemicals on animal models, cellular models, gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammatory processes which may explain what we observe,” Touvier said.\n\nIn addition, both studies controlled for such confounding factors as a physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, medication use and lifestyle factors, Touvier said.\n\n“The finding that specific classes of preservatives are associated with increased risk of select cancers was robust to all of these adjustments, indicating it is a matter that warrants respect and requires further research,” Katz said.\n\nThe type 2 diabetes study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications, examined the role of preservatives and the potential risk of type 2 diabetes in nearly 109,000 of the NutriNet-Santé participants who did not have the disease at the start of the study.\n\nTwelve of the 17 preservatives researchers examined were linked with nearly a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people who consumed the highest levels.\n\nFive of the same preservatives that caused cancer — potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic acid and sodium acetate — also raised the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In this case the probability rose by 49%, according to the research.\n\nA sixth preservative — calcium propionate — was also connected. It’s a white powder used to stop mold and bacterial growth.\n\nIn this study on type 2 diabetes, more than two antioxidant additives increased risk. Additives that increased risk by 42% included alpha-tocopherol, the most bioavailable form of vitamin E; sodium ascorbate, which is a buffered form of vitamin C and sodium; rosemary extracts; sodium erythorbate, made from fermented sugar; phosphoric acid, a preservative in sodas, processed meats, cheeses and other foods; and citric acid, a flavor enhancer, preservative and pH adjuster with no significant nutritional value.\n\nSince these two studies are the first to examine the role of preservatives in the development of cancer and type 2 diabetes, much more research will be required to confirm and expand the findings, said Anaïs Hasenböhler, the first author of both studies who is a doctoral student at the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team at the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord.\n\nHowever, Hasenböhler added in a statement, “These new data add to others in favour of a reassessment of the regulations governing the general use of food additives by the food industry in order to improve consumer protection.”\n\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.",

After all, selling burgers and fries may lack the glitz and glamour of a high-octane growth story, but it can be just the ticket for powering your passive income stream in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHere's why McDonald's is a top Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) component to buy in January.\n\nLast October, McDonald's raised its dividend for the 49th consecutive year -- putting McDonald's on track to become a Dividend King in 2026.\n\nDividend Kings are companies that have raised their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years. To pull off that feat, companies must consistently grow earnings so they can afford the higher dividend expense. The dividend becomes a key priority for returning capital to shareholders and managing investor expectations.\n\nHowever, plenty of Dividend Kings are stodgy, slow-growing consumer staples and industrial companies. Unlike Dividend Kings that are past their prime, McDonald's is an ultra-high-margin cash cow with a track record of rewarding shareholders with solid returns on top of the dividend -- with McDonald's producing a 229% total return over the last decade. But McDonald's has cooled, with the stock up just under 15% in the last three years compared to a nearly 80% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nThe restaurant industry has been under pressure because it depends on consumer discretionary spending. Sit-down restaurants that rely on experiences have been struggling the most, whereas restaurants that cater to convenience and value are doing relatively better.\n\nIn McDonald's latest quarter, which was the third quarter of 2025, comparable sales increased by 3.6% and systemwide sales grew by 8% year over year. Systemwide revenue refers to McDonald's restaurants that are corporate-owned or franchised.\n\nSimilarly, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR), which is a quick-service restaurant conglomerate that owns Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes, and Firehouse Subs, grew systemwide sales by 6.9% in the third quarter of 2025, including 4% comparable sales growth.",

    "description": "\"I want to properly understand.\"",
    "fullText": "Tens of thousands of years ago, a new study suggests, a warming event led to the release of carbon dioxide from deep in the Southern Ocean. Now, scientists say, these findings could shed light on the potential fallout from continued warming in the Antarctic.\n\nLed by scientists at the Laoshan Laboratory in Qingdao, China, and Germany's GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, the study looked at sediment cores from the Southern Ocean to understand the behavior of Antarctic Bottom Water, or AABW.\n\n​​\"We wanted to understand how the influence of Antarctic Bottom Water, the coldest and densest water mass in the global ocean, changed during the last deglaciation, and what role it played in the global carbon cycle,\" said Huang Huang, who led the study, in a GEOMAR press release.\n\nThe researchers' findings, published recently in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggest that AABW expansion helped bring the last Ice Age to an end.\n\n\"As the planet warmed and the ice sheets melted between about 18,000 and 10,000 years ago, the volume of Antarctic Bottom Water expanded in two distinct phases,\" according to the release.\n\n\"These phases coincided with known warming events in Antarctica. As vertical mixing in the Southern Ocean increased, the carbon that had been stored in the deep ocean was able to return to the atmosphere.\"\n\nThe research team found that the deepest waters stayed fairly stagnant and out of touch with shallower waters until the Earth began to warm. When the water was stirred up by the expansion created by the warming of the planet, carbon stores were released into the Earth's atmosphere, forcing temperatures higher.\n\nThe team's study goes back tens of thousands of years and thousands of meters down into the ocean. But its insights could be relevant today and on land where countless communities are vulnerable to the impacts of rising global temperatures.\n\n\"Comparisons with the past are always imperfect, but ultimately it comes down to how much energy is in the system,\" said GEOMAR geochemist Marcus Gutjahr, per the release. \"If we understand how the ocean responded to warming in the past, we can better grasp what is happening today as Antarctic ice shelves continue to melt.\"\n\nDeep Southern Ocean waters have warmed faster than most others in the past half-century. If the warming waters and thawing ice repeat the patterns of the past, huge amounts of carbon could be released into the atmosphere again and contribute to subsequent temperature rise.\n\nShould we be pouring money into nuclear fusion technology?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"I want to properly understand the modern ocean in order to interpret signals from the past,\" Gutjahr said. \"If we can trace how Antarctic Bottom Water has changed over the last few thousand years, we can assess more accurately how rapidly the Antarctic Ice Sheet may continue to lose mass in the future.\"\n\nOther studies have shown that sea ice levels have dropped alarmingly over the last 50 years.\n\nAdvances in this field could help world leaders and global organizations prepare for the potentially catastrophic consequences of continued planetary warming. Evidence about the threats of sea level rise, food system disruptions, and disease spread can inform adaptation strategies.\n\nBut such alarming findings could also help stir meaningful public action now to mitigate rising temperatures, such as transitioning to cleaner home energy systems and transportation options.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Michigan parents have claimed insurance company Geico refused to cover their car crash because their young children weren’t listed on their policy.\n\nKara Vogel and Carson Howatt of Chelsea got into a crash on Christmas Eve last month with their 1-and-a-half-year-old daughter and 3-month-old son. Howatt told local news no one was injured in the minor crash.\n\n“We were going through a roundabout and a driver came on our right side and just didn’t yield to the roundabout and just hit us right in the front of our car,” Vogel told local news outlet Click On Detroit.\n\nThe damage to the family’s car could cost between $5,000 and $15,000. The parents said they were told it wouldn’t be covered since their children were not listed on their insurance policy. The family has used Geico since they bought their car six months ago, before their son was even born.\n\n“They asked if they are my kids and if they lived with me,” Howatt said. “I didn’t think anything of it, so, I was, like, ‘Yes, of course, they are my kids and they live with me and they were in the car when the accident occurred, in their car seats, but no one was hurt.’”\n\nHowatt admitted he signed a form stating that he and his wife were the only ones in their household.\n\n“We weren’t thinking, like, ‘This is going to completely ruin our financial situation.’ It didn’t seem big. The airbags didn’t go off,” Vogel said.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the family and to Geico for comment.\n\nGeico explained in a statement to Click On Detroit that “all household residents must be listed on the auto policy, regardless of age,” according to Michigan law. The state reformed no-fault auto insurance in 2019, including Personal Injury Protection requirements.\n\nThe issue was eventually resolved and the family said they won’t have to pay out of pocket. But they said Geico told them they would need to add their children to their policy.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates have sustained a long stretch of stability. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate is 6.01%, down three basis points. Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed home loan rate is up four basis points to 5.45%.

Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.01% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the last cut to the federal funds rate in December, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates have been stuck in a rut — but there was a general move lower over the past couple of months. According to Freddie Mac data, 30-year mortgage rates remain about a half-point below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.\n\nZillow Home Loans isn’t just a marketplace — it’s also a mortgage lender with conventional, FHA, and VA loans, to name a few.

    "description": "During this hearing, under the new state law, prosecutors were able to request that Aundre Matthews be held without bond.",
    "fullText": "An 18-year-old student charged with murder in the stabbing death of a classmate was denied bond on Wednesday.\n\nAundre Matthews is accused of killing Andrew Meismer after a fight between the two escalated during a science class at Sterling High School in Baytown, according to court records. Investigators say the dispute began over a $21 vape pen Matthews said was missing and believed that Meismer took.\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Cory Scott, an investigator with the Goose Creek Police Department, testified to seeing \"quite a bit\" of blood in the classroom, on the floor, and splattered on the wall on the day of the incident.\n\nWednesday's hearing was also one of the first under the new state law in which a prosecutor can request a defendant be held with no bond in non-capital offenses.\n\n\"It's brand new. This is the constitutional amendment that, as we've talked about, gives prosecutors and the judiciary another tool in the toolbox to ensure that people (who) shouldn't be out get to stay in,\" Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare said following Matthews' hearing.\n\nDuring the hearing, Matthews showed no visible emotion as prosecutors and defense attorneys argued whether he should be eligible for bond. Meismer's family was present in the courtroom.\n\nDetective Scott also presented surveillance video from inside the school. While the video was not released publicly, prosecutors described footage showing Matthews and Meismer entering an empty science lab together. Minutes later, a teacher's aide was seen pushing Matthews out of the room.\n\nProsecutors told the judge that Matthews stabbed Meismer inside the lab and argued that Matthews poses an ongoing threat to the community.\n\n\"It took over a minute to pry this defendant from this victim,\" a prosecutor said in court, adding that Matthews allegedly held Meismer in a chokehold as blood poured from his wounds.\n\nThe state also introduced Matthews' school disciplinary records, which prosecutors said showed an escalating pattern of behavior, including a prior incident in which he allegedly brought a knife to school.\n\nJudge Emily Detoto cited those school records as a key factor in her decision to deny bond.\n\n\"The school records are voluminous,\" DA Teare said, \"and they indicate an escalating pattern of behavior.\"\n\nMatthews' defense attorney, Gian Paolo Mecerola, said he was not surprised by the ruling but argued that responsibility also lies with the school district. He noted that Matthews was part of a special education program and said the district was aware of behavioral concerns but allowed him to continue attending school.\n\n\"There are clearly issues here,\" Mecerola said, adding that Matthews is being raised by his sister, who is his legal guardian. He said he is continuing to investigate those circumstances.\n\nDistrict Attorney Teare emphasized that the hearing was not a determination of guilt or innocence. Instead, he said, it was narrowly focused on whether Matthews should remain in custody while the case moves forward. The case has not yet been presented to a grand jury, and no trial date has been set.\n\n\"This is whole new for everyone,\" Teare said of the bond denial process. \"We don't have a full-time frame yet.\"\n\nAndrew Meissmer's family attended the hearing but declined to comment afterward.\n\nThe case remains in its early stages, and Matthews will continue to be held without bond as the legal process continues.\n\nHigh school student dies after being stabbed by a classmate in Baytown, Goose Creek CISD says\n\nHarris County DA's office accepts murder charge for teen accused in classmate's stabbing: Officials\n\n$3 million bond for student accused of stabbing friend in school, as school district stays quiet\n\nFor news updates, follow Miya Shay on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "description": "-Mughrabi Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man.",
    "fullText": "Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man. On December 29, Hamas announced that he had died, aged 49, around seven months after Israel said it killed him in a strike.\n\nHamas did not provide details on Sinwar's death but ​said it mourned him along with other group leaders, describing them as \"heroic martyrs\". Hamas confirmed in the statement that Sinwar had been the head of the group's armed forces.\n\nSinwar was elevated ‌to the top ranks of Hamas in 2024 after the death in combat of his brother Yahya, mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel that led to the war in Gaza and later overall leader of the Palestinian organisation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ‌in May 2025 that Sinwar had been killed. Less than two weeks later, the Israeli army said it had retrieved Sinwar's body in an underground tunnel beneath a hospital in southern Gaza.\n\nSinwar's death is expected to leave his next in command Izzeldeen Haddad, who had been overseeing operations in northern Gaza, in charge of Hamas' armed wing across the whole of the enclave.\n\nIt is unclear how the death will affect decision-making in Hamas more broadly - for example, whether it will bolster or diminish the influence of exiled members of the group's leadership council on policy matters, in particular the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire plan agreed with Israel in October.\n\nHamas officials described ⁠Sinwar as a \"ghost\" who long outfoxed Israel's intelligence agencies.\n\nLike his brother Yahya, Sinwar ‌had survived many Israeli assassination attempts, including airstrikes and planted explosives, Hamas sources said.\n\nWhen Sinwar once visited a cemetery, his comrades discovered a remote-controlled explosive resembling a brick planted along his path, according to the Hamas sources.\n\nIn 2003, Hamas operatives discovered a bomb in the wall of Mohammad Sinwar's house, foiling an assassination attempt that the ‍group blamed on Israeli intelligence.\n\nKnown for clandestine operations, Mohammad Sinwar played a central role in planning and executing Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the country's worst security failure, Hamas sources said.\n\nHe was also widely believed to have been one of the masterminds of the 2006 cross-border attack and abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.\n\nHamas held Shalit for five years before he was swapped for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel.\n\nUnder the deal, his brother Yahya Sinwar, whose ​meticulous planning for the 2023 attack shattered Israel's reputation as an invincible power in a hostile region, was among those who were released.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to eradicate Hamas. The offensive against ‌Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces, the Middle East's most advanced military, severely weakened the organisation.\n\nYahya Sinwar was killed in combat during a routine Israeli patrol in Gaza in 2024.\n\nIsrael released footage of a severely wounded Yahya Sinwar throwing a piece of wood at a hovering drone - his last act of defiance towards his old foe before his death and his brother's rise.\n\nBut the group, which was created during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in 1987 and which carried out suicide bombings that traumatised Israelis in the second one, is still standing.\n\nBorn on September 16, 1975, Sinwar rarely appeared in public or spoke to the media. He granted a lengthy interview to Al Jazeera for a documentary broadcast in 2022, but wore a cap and sat in the dark to hide his appearance.\n\nThe Sinwars originally came from Asqalan - now the Israeli ⁠city of Ashkelon, a short distance to the north of the Gaza Strip. Alongside hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, ​they became refugees in what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, at the time of Israel's declaration of independence during the ​1948 war.\n\nThe family settled in Khan Younis in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble in the latest war.\n\nMohammad Sinwar was educated in schools run by the United Nations' Palestinian relief agency (UNRWA), which has long been a target of Israeli criticism, including during the recent war in Gaza.\n\nHe joined Hamas shortly after its founding, influenced by his brother ‍Yahya, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the ⁠oldest and at one time most influential Islamist group in the Middle East.\n\nHis reputation as a hardliner helped him rise through the group's military ranks. By 2005, he was leading Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade.\n\nThe unit, one of the largest and most powerful battalions in Hamas' armed wing, has been responsible for cross-border attacks, firing rockets and planting bombs along the frontier. “Striking Tel Aviv is easier than ⁠drinking water,\" Sinwar told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe unit also watches the movements of Israeli soldiers around the clock. In 2006, elite commandos led by Sinwar took part in Shalit's abduction.\n\nSources close to Hamas say Sinwar developed close ties with Marwan Issa, the deputy commander ‌of Hamas' military wing, and Mohammed Deif, the aloof military chief. Both men were killed by Israel in 2024.\n\nIn its statement announcing Sinwar's death on December 29, Hamas said that ‌he had succeeded Deif.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nWith an estimated net worth of about $147.5 billion, legendary investor Warren Buffett has built a tremendous financial empire — making him the ninth richest person in the world (1).\n\nNow, at 95 years old, Buffett has finally retired from his longtime post as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, having announced the decision at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in early May. Vice-chair Greg Abel took over the top job as of Jan. 1, 2026 while Buffett will remain as chairman.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

One of his most famous rules is to buy and hold for as long as possible.\n\n“You’ve got to be prepared when you buy a stock to have it go down 50% or more, and be comfortable with it … but some people are not really careful,” Buffett said during Berkshire Hathaway’s 2020 annual shareholder meeting (3).\n\n“Some people are more subject to fear than others.”\n\nHere’s how to fight the fear and build a better future.\n\nMarket volatility isn’t exactly a foreign concept for the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett began investing when he was 11, back in 1942. Having lived through several recessions, Buffett has, time and again, shrugged off short-term market volatility.\n\n“Over the long term, the stock market news will be good,” Buffett wrote in an Op-Ed for the NY Times in 2008 (4).\n\n“In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.”",
