    "fullText": "BYU didn’t have to look far to find its new defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Cougars are working to finalize a deal to have Kelly Poppinga lead the BYU defense, according to a Wednesday report from ESPN’s Pete Thamel.\n\nPoppinga would replace Jay Hill, who left Provo to become Michigan’s defensive coordinator under new head coach Kyle Whittingham.\n\nA former Cougars linebacker, Poppinga has spent two stints and 10 total seasons on BYU’s coaching staff, first from 2009-2015 under Bronco Mendenhall and then the past three campaigns with Kalani Sitake’s operation.\n\nUpon Mendenhall’s hiring at the University of Virginia in 2016, Poppinga followed him east to be part of his Cavaliers staff for six seasons, notably spending 2018-21 as Virginia’s co-defensive coordinator alongside Nick Howell.\n\nPoppinga had served as BYU’s special teams coordinator and defensive ends coach since 2023, having held the same positions in 2022 at Boise State as well.\n\nIn his time with the Cougars, Poppinga has coached NFL talent such as Kyle Van Noy, Fred Warner, Sione Takitaki, Tyler Batty and others.\n\nWith Poppinga’s pending promotion and Aaron Roderick remaining as BYU’s offensive coordinator, Sitake would still need to fill the Cougars’ vacant special teams coordinator position as well as a few defensive assistant roles.",

    "description": "Darren Fletcher will remain in charge of Manchester United for their FA Cup match against Brighton - as the club battle problems that go far deeper than sorting out managerial uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Darren Fletcher has confirmed he will remain as Manchester United's interim coach for the FA Cup third-round tie with Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday.\n\nHowever, if there is one reality reinforced by United's 2-2 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor, it is that whatever issues there are at Old Trafford, they will not be solved merely be switching the man in the dugout.\n\n\"They have informed me they would like me to take the team on Sunday,\" said Fletcher.\n\n\"There was a feeling that might be the case on Monday, but we wanted to focused on Burnley. I am tasked with leading the team on Sunday, so all my focus and energy goes on that now.\"\n\n'They' are United chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.\n\nAs the final whistle sounded, the TV cameras panned to the directors' box and picked the pair out.\n\nThey looked absolutely freezing, which was not a surprise as it was a perishing January night in Lancashire.\n\nBut they also seemed to have plenty on their minds as they stood silently.\n\nThat was not a surprise either after the latest in a succession of frustrating performances.\n\nSince the beginning of November, United have played 10 matches against the teams currently in the bottom eight of the Premier League. They have won two of them.\n\nTheir past three matches have all been against teams either mired in the relegation zone, in the cases of Wolves and Burnley, or trying desperately to stay out of it, such as Leeds. Their return is three draws.\n\nAnd old problems remain, despite axing Ruben Amorim in the wake of Sunday's 1-1 draw at Elland Road and, specifically, the emotional outburst that followed. Those problems remain despite Fletcher immediately moving away from the Portuguese coach's 3-4-3 set-up in favour of a back four.\n\nIn successive away matches at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in November, United led, fell behind and had to fight back for a 2-2 draw.\n\nThis was the other way round - as they fell behind and fought back to lead thanks to Benjamin Sesko's first double since his £73.7m move from RB Leipzig in the summer, only to concede a second goal in a match they dominated.\n\nUnited have still only kept two clean sheets all season. Fletcher accepts it is not good enough.\n\n\"I think it has been proved over the season they [we] give up goals too easily,\" said the former United and Scotland midfielder.\n\n\"There is a tactical element when you change to a back five as there is more space to cover but we defend as a full team.\n\n\"As a team we need to improve in defending and not concede so many goals.\"\n\nThe secondary element is United do not take enough of their chances.\n\nIt is a reality that Amorim's goals-per-game ratio - 1.4 - was the second-worst of any United boss in the Premier League era, with only Ralf Rangnick below him.\n\nIf there is a positive, it is that Fletcher exceeded that figure in his first game in charge. The disappointment comes from the knowledge his side scored two goals from 30 shots, 10 of which were on target.\n\nTwice, Burnley cleared goal-bound efforts off the line. Sesko wasted a couple of opportunities to complete his hat-trick and Lisandro Martinez had a goal disallowed for a push on former Manchester City defender Kyle Walker.\n\n\"I am not sure why,\" grumbled Fletcher. \"We should win the match.\"\n\nBrighton represent the first hurdle in United's last remaining quest to win silverware this season.\n\nWhoever gets the job, their immediate task will not be an easy one. United's next two Premier League games are at home to Manchester City and away at Arsenal.\n\nNot that the evening was entirely without positives.\n\nSesko had not scored since October and had just two goals to his name from almost five months as a United player. Now he has four after a pair of clinical first-time finishes to passes from Bruno Fernandes and Patrick Dorgu.\n\n\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him videos of his movement and how opportunities are going to come,\" said Fletcher.\n\n\"It is just a case of keep believing and making runs. Hopefully they start flooding in from now. It was a real positive night for him.\"\n\nAmorim did give the England Under-20 international his debut with a single appearance from the bench but repeatedly refused to use him despite depressing results.\n\nA six-minute cameo at Turf Moor showed the folly of that decision.\n\nOn his first attacking raid, Lacey cut in from the right wing as he likes to do and curled a beautiful effort at the home goal, which crashed off the bar.\n\nWith United's final attack, he took aim again. For a brief moment, his long-range shot looked to be going in before it floated agonisingly wide.\n\nFrom Fletcher's assessment, it is fair to assume it is not the last we have seen of him.\n\n\"I said to him stay wide on the right and go and do what you do,\" said Fletcher.\n\n\"I know he is going to make an impact. He is creative, has goals in his, is exciting, direct, fearless.\n\n\"I am really pleased with him because he had a really bright game. We know the talent he has got.\n\n\"He will be a big part of Manchester United's future, I have no doubts about that.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Suns guard targeted by fringe Eastern Conference contender originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns are one of the most pleasant surprises of the NBA season thus far, and many are begging the question of whether or not buying at the deadline is worth breaking up some of the best team chemistry in the league.\n\nWhile the Suns might not necessarily be looking to make moves this deadline, some opposing franchises are attracted by the assets they have.\n\nAccoring to national NBA insider and reporter for Clutch Points Brett Siegel, the Milwaukee Bucks have their eyes on injured star Suns guard Jalen Green.\n\n\"Suns guard Jalen Green is among the many players the Bucks have recently discussed as a potential trade option, league sources told ClutchPoints,\" Siegel said. \"However, the Suns have made it clear Green is not available.\"\n\nGreen has only played in two games this season dealing with multiple injuries. In his only full game with the Suns, he erupted for 29 points, giving Phoenix's fans and executives hope for his fit alongside Devin Booker, who is one of the most doubled guards in the league.\n\nMORE: Dillon Brooks reacts to Suns owner shooting down idea of trading him\n\nGreen has played in just two games for Phoenix this season, remaining out since early November with a right hamstring strain. In his first and only full game with the Suns, he erupted for 29 points on 6-for-13 on 3-pointers and 4-for-7 on 2-pointers in a 115-102 win against the Los Angeles Clippers. He exited the next game after playing just six minutes.\n\nThe former Houston Rockets guard was the key figure in Phoenix's offseason trade that sent Kevin Durant to the Rockets for Green, Brooks and the draft picks that turned into Khaman Maluach, Rasheer Fleming and Koby Brea.\n\nWhile Green hasn't been able to see the floor, Brooks has risen as a prominent offensive staple in the Suns' otherwise lackluster scoring attack, what with Green, a scoring force in his own right, missing all but two games this season.\n\nTrade Proposal sends Nets Michael Porter Jr to Eastern Conference powerhouse\n\nKnicks cut ties with Jalen Brunson's 6-foot-8 teammate after less than two seasons\n\nKevin Love explains why LeBron James is the 'smartest player' he ever played with\n\nLakers’ JJ Redick details how he optimizes LeBron James at his old age",

    "description": "New Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior was optimistic when arriving, but Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Fulham underlines the scale of the task ahead.",
    "fullText": "New Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior arrived with optimism, but Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Fulham underlined the scale of the task ahead.\n\nThe 41-year-old described his appointment as \"one of the proudest moments of his life\", yet the reality was clear as Chelsea dropped out of the Premier League top five for the first time since August.\n\nSitting in the directors' box alongside co-owner Behdad Eghbali and members of the sporting leadership team, Rosenior watched as the side he has inherited slipped to eighth.\n\nHe replaced Enzo Maresca after the Italian fell out with the Blues hierarchy, with Rosenior joining from French club Strasbourg who share Chelsea's owners.\n\nThose decision-makers were targeted by chants from the away end during the match at Fulham, while the Chelsea players struggled against their west London rivals on the pitch.\n\nChelsea have won just one of their past nine league games and two of 11 in all competitions, falling from potential title contenders in November to a side now lagging far behind.\n\nThey have ground to make up to achieve their minimum aim this season – qualifying for the Champions League, which should be achievable with a top-five finish.\n\nBBC Sport looks at the problems Rosenior faces on and off the pitch.\n\nListen: Football Daily - The Debrief\n\nIf Chelsea's relationship with the fans isn't broken, it is certainly fraying.\n\nJust hours after Rosenior was confirmed in his new post, the Chelsea Supporters' Trust released a highly critical survey - not aimed at the appointment, but at the club's leadership.\n\nAmong the headlines was that more than half of respondents doubt Chelsea will achieve success in the next three to five years under the current regime. A similar proportion lack confidence in the ownership's decision-making.\n\nRosenior seemed aware of the stakes. In his first interview with the club's media channels, he used the word 'win' 14 times - a clear signal that he understands the only way to repair this fractured relationship is through results.\n\nThe former Fulham defender also referenced playing against Didier Drogba, Arjen Robben, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and Michael Essien - acknowledging the fear factor Chelsea once commanded during the Roman Abramovich ownership era. These were savvy remarks from the London-born coach, showing he understands the club's identity.\n\nYet even he may not grasp the depth of anger that exists among the fanbase. On Wednesday, chants in support of the sanctioned Russian oligarch who transformed Chelsea rang out across Stamford Bridge, alongside unsavoury songs aimed at co-controlling owner Eghbali and Clearlake Capital.\n\nThere will also be a protest before Rosenior's first league match against Brentford, who leapfrogged them in the table on Wednesday, on Saturday week.\n\nRosenior must know he could become a target himself if results do not come quickly. He embodies everything Todd Boehly and Clearlake believe in: he is young, progressive, and connected to their multi-club model via Strasbourg.\n\nSigning off his first interview, Rosenior said: \"Believe in what is an amazing football club, believe in the players, and when you give energy to the team, you help them win. That's why we are here. I can't wait to meet them and do that soon.\"\n\nChelsea have spent more than £1.5bn on new players since 2022. Although they have raised over £750m through player sales, results have not matched the scale of investment.\n\nMuch of the criticism has focused on the club assembling the youngest squad in the Premier League, with an average starting XI aged under 24. No team that young has ever won the title in the Premier League era.\n\nChelsea have shown flashes of quality but often lose control and drop points. Former boss Maresca highlighted the issue after his side dropped a league-high 15 points from winning positions this season.\n\nRosenior faces similar concerns. His Strasbourg team, with an average age of around 21, dropped 13 points from winning positions and won only two of their past 10 Ligue 1 matches.\n\nInsiders at Chelsea insist they want to be Champions League regulars and eventually challenge for the biggest titles. Yet to achieve even their minimum aims, Chelsea and Rosenior need to find momentum quickly.\n\nChelsea were reduced to 10 men at Fulham when Marc Cucurella was sent off for pulling back Harry Wilson as he broke through on goal.\n\nWilson later scored the winner with a fine finish in the 82nd minute.\n\nCaretaker manager Calum McFarlane defended Cucurella by saying: \"There's been a lot made of the red cards this season. I don't think this one is ill-disciplined. This is football. You get caught one-v-one and Marc is one of the best defenders in the world.\"\n\nHowever, McFarlane admitted concern over three yellow cards that followed immediately for dissent after the dismissal, shown to Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Tosin Adarabioyo.\n\n\"The three yellow cards directly after is something we'll have to look at, but I would argue that we don't want that to happen,\" McFarlane said.\n\nMcFarlane was also later cautioned for questioning the referee.\n\nSince the start of the 2023-24 season, Chelsea have received 251 yellow cards and 11 reds – the most of any Premier League club. They have had five red cards for players in the league this season, and one \n\nFormer boss Maresca had been trying to address the issue before his departure.\n\n'A moving moment' as Rosenior breaks barriers\n\n'It means the world to me' - Chelsea appoint Rosenior\n\nWilson downs Chelsea in front of new boss Rosenior\n\nRosenior joined team meetings before the Fulham match and travelled with the squad to Craven Cottage.\n\nHis first full training session is scheduled for Thursday. He will then be presented to the media on Friday before selecting his first team for Saturday's FA Cup third-round game at Charlton Athletic.\n\nIn the following week, Chelsea face Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-final, followed by Rosenior's first Premier League match at home to Brentford.\n\nThe Debrief: Semenyo leaves Bournemouth in style, Newcastle score the latest-ever winner and six other PL games\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium will be the site of the league's signature regular-season event, which the Utah Mammoth will host in the franchise's third season.\n\nThe Mammoth will welcome the Colorado Avalanche in a college football venue that seats approximately 51,400 on a fall Saturday in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe date of the game has yet to be finalized, but NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Mammoth owners Ryan and Ashley Smith revealed the matchup Wednesday, along with Mammoth center Logan Cooley.\n\nLogan Cooley on getting to play in the 2027 Winter Classic at Rice-Eccles Stadium: pic.twitter.com/SduTSBg5ah\n\n— Jenna Fink (@jennamfink) January 7, 2026\n\nThe Mammoth, who formed after the Arizona Coyotes were dissolved in April 2024, are currently in their second season.\n\nAfter an 8-2 start to the season, they're now 20-20-3 and in fourth place of the Central Division with 43 points.\n\nThis season, the Mammoth still have one more head-to-head meeting versus the Avalanche, who are the division leaders with a 31-4-7 record. Colorado is also atop the Western Conference at the moment with 69 points.\n\nThe Mammoth and Avalanche have met six times over the past two seasons, with Colorado holding a five-point advantage over Utah in the series. Their lone remaining matchup during the 2025-26 season is on Feb. 25 in Utah.\n\nNext season's Winter Classic will mark the Avalanche's fourth appearance in an outdoor game. Utah, on the other hand, will soon become the 32nd NHL franchise to play in an outdoor game.\n\nThe Classic started as an annual tradition on Jan. 1, 2008. At the time, the Buffalo Sabres played the Pittsburgh Penguins at what was then known as Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, home of the NFL's Buffalo Bills.\n\nThis year's Winter Classic was held Jan. 2 at the Miami Marlins' loanDepot Park. The New York Rangers defeated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers 5-1.\n\nIt was the fifth straight Classic at a baseball stadium.\n\nThat streak will end next season in Salt Lake City, where the University of Utah's campus will take center stage, as Rice-Eccles becomes the fourth college football stadium to host the event.\n\nNotably, Rice-Eccles also put on the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics. It's scheduled to fulfill the same role when the Games return to Utah in 2034.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have smashed preseason expectations in head coach Mike Vrabel’s first year.\n\nThey secured the AFC’s No. 2 seed and will host the Los Angeles Chargers at Gillette Stadium in the Wildcard round on Sunday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it will be second-year quarterback Drake Maye’s NFL postseason debut. But it will be far from Maye’s first truly meaningful game.\n\nIn 2022, the then-20-year-old quarterback squared off with the college football juggernauts that are the Clemson Tigers in the ACC Conference Championship game.\n\nIt was Maye’s sophomore year at the University of North Carolina, and he had brought the Tar Heels to a 9-3 record and a top-25 ranking.\n\nMaye was asked during his Wednesday afternoon press conference what he learned from that experience.\n\n“Maybe a little bit,” Maye said when asked if that college experience correlates to his NFL playoff debut. “Getting back to trying to play for championships… I think it’s a little bit different in the NFL.\n\n“Just the mentality of ‘win or go home’ or ‘win and advance,’ and I think that’s the biggest thing that’s different. In the ACC Championship, you go to a bowl game. Here it’s (win) now, or you’re going home.”\n\nMaye was unable to win the conference championship in 2022, and, as he alluded to, earned a second chance in a game against Bo Nix’s 15th-ranked Oregon Ducks.\n\nMaye threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns in the 2022 Holiday Bowl. He led his team to a 24-10 fourth-quarter lead and added three points on his final drive of the game.\n\nThe defense was unable to stop the Ducks’ two-minute drill as Nix threw the game-winning touchdown with 19 seconds on the clock and beat the Tar Heels 28-27.\n\nDrake Maye Silences Emerging Narrative About Patriots-Chargers Matchup",

Insider drops huge update\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times' Rich Stroud was first on this. Bowles will return as head coach in 2026.\n\nThe response to this news has been rather interesting, with some saying Bowles deserved another go around, while others think the opposite.\n\nWith a contract that keeps him around until 2028, Bowles has financial security, and now work begins on getting the Buccaneers back to the playoffs next season.\n\nIt was a tough season, especially in the second half, with the Buccaneers in freefall, losing seven of their last nine games.\n\nBut Bowles has been given the chance to rectify it, and getting adequate protection for Mayfield is a good way to do it.\n\nBuccaneers get what they deserve after Week 18 disaster\n\nBuccaneers 'break that spell' in Week 18, but too little, too late?\n\nNo Week 18 pity party for Buccaneers' Todd Bowles\n\nWhy Buccaneers' 'main focus' is an odd aspect of Week 18",

It marks his eighth with the Lakers as he continues to help the franchise make a case as a title contender throughout the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nPaul has represented James as his agent since 2012, assisting him in making the biggest decisions of his career.

One of them involved the scenario of James departing via trade, something that the longtime agent shut down due to the star's own stance.\n\nMORE: Lakers' LeBron James sends five-word message to Bronny James after monster G-League dunk\n\n“He can’t be traded unless he wants to be traded.

Staying with the Lakers, especially as he goes through the final year of his contract before entering the 2026 offseason as an unrestricted free agent, will pave the way for Paul to have a major role in negotiations.\n\nRegardless of what happens in the near future for James, he will have the best representation by his side with Paul helping him along the way.\n\nLakers’ JJ Redick details how he optimizes LeBron James at his old age\n\nFormer All-Star and LeBron James opponent can’t believe Lakers star is still doing this\n\nLakers' LeBron James addresses offensive fit with Luka Doncic, shuts down continued rumors",

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs will have an excellent opportunity to revamp their roster during the 2026 NFL Draft, starting with the No. 9 pick in the Annual Selection Meeting's first round.\n\nIt has been nearly a decade since Kansas City has picked in the top-10, and with plenty of needs to fill in the coming offseason, Chiefs general manager Brett Veach will need to be judicious with his selections to get his team back into the playoffs.\n\nTake a look at this seven-round mock draft, which projects that Kansas City's front office will target offensive skill positions before addressing its defensive needs:\n\nThe Chiefs waste no time finding an exciting playmaker to help Patrick Mahomes. Tate will be one of the first pass-catchers off the board, and could be exactly the kind of dynamic route-runner that Kansas City needs to reinvent its air attack.\n\nJohnson would immediately be able to take over as the Chiefs' leading rusher to bring some 'juice' to the ground game that Kansas City has sorely missed in the past few seasons.\n\nThis might not be the most exciting pick, but Orange — nicknamed 'Big Citrus' — is exactly the kind of run-stuffer that the Chiefs need in the middle of their defensive line.\n\nKansas City selected Nohl Williams out of Cal last year, and takes Masses here in the fourth round to add another former Golden Bear ball-hawk on Day 3.\n\nGiven that the Chiefs ended the season with their third-string quarterback under center, it seems logical that Kansas City might decide to invest a pick at the position this year. Allar was once considered one of the most exciting quarterback prospects in college football, and joins the Chiefs in Round 5 to become Patrick Mahomes' long-term understudy.\n\nAfter addressing wide receiver and running back early, Kansas City targets Gyllenborg to round out its selections of offensive skill position players.\n\nTapp tallied 12 tackles for loss and 7.5 sacks in 2025 and joins the Chiefs as a developmental prospect who could potentially help bolster the edges of Kansas City's defensive line.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL Draft: Chiefs take WR, RB early in this seven round mock",

    "fullText": "Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre said Wednesday that anyone who says he has thrown in the towel on his battle with Parkinson's disease is spreading fake news.\n\n\"Thank you everyone for your prayers and concerns, but contrary to reports, I have not given up hope in my battle with Parkinson’s!\" the 56-year-old Super Bowl champion wrote on X. \"Not sure where this came from — but just like I never gave up on the gridiron — not going to start now. I pray there will be a cure one day and I appreciate you all.\"\n\nFavre also told TMZ on Wednesday: \"I have absolutely not given up and I am fighting till the end. Yes I have progressed a little faster than I would have hoped at this point but I’m extremely thankful and blessed!!!\"\n\nThe former Packers/Jets/Vikings quarterback revealed his Parkinson's diagnosis last year but hadn't gone into much detail about it until last week's episode of his \"4th and Favre\" podcast.\n\nOn the podcast, Favre sounds like he's trying to be realistic about his condition while also remaining hopeful.\n\n“As you well know, there’s no cure,\" Favre said. \"I hear from time to time, ‘Well, they’re five years away from a cure.’ You know, I hope that that’s the case. I really do. But I’m not holding my breath.\"\n\nHe mentioned Michael J. Fox and Muhammad Ali as people who \"have really set the bar high on Parkinson’s and treatments and things of that nature.\"\n\n\"And I’m sure that when they were diagnosed, they thought, ‘Well, they’ll have a cure in five years. I’ll be fine,’\" Favre said. \"Well, that’s not the case. So, I’m optimistic, but again, I’m not holding my breath.”\n\nFavre's comments on Wednesday may have been in response to a recent online article that seemed to interpret his podcast remarks in a different way than he intended.\n\nAlso on the podcast, Favre said he's in the early stages of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which is the most common type of the disorder. He said his major symptoms are \"rigidity and stiffness,\" which is worst in the morning before he takes his medication and has particularly affected his right side.\n\nFavre added that he occasionally experiences shaking but has not had any memory loss issues.\n\n“All in all, I’m pretty good,\" he said. \"I would say I’ve progressed maybe a little. ... If you dropped a dime on the floor in front of me and I reached down with my right hand, I may for five minutes try to pick up that dime and eventually just grab it with my left hand. Initially when I would take the medicine, my dexterity in my right hand was pretty smooth. But that’s not the case anymore.\n\n“So that’s one of the reasons I think I may have progressed a little bit. Hopefully not. Maybe it’s I’m looking into something more than it really is, but all in all, again I’m very blessed and thankful.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

Hailing from Slovenia, he didn’t have much experience with golf growing up, but after his decades-long transplant to sunny SoCal, he found himself playing it more and more, especially in charity games put on by the Kings.\n\nThe competitive drive that has made him one of the best hockey players of his generation also played into getting him into golf  as well after a disappointing charity tournament performance left a sour taste in his mouth.\n\n“I wasn't really into it until I severely embarrassed myself my second year on that charity golf tournament. So I figured I’d just work at it a little bit. And then I hit the seven iron right in the sweet spot and then I was hooked,” Kopitar said.\n\nKopitar joins an investor group that includes several other notable athletes and figures in entertainment like primary owners Alexis Ohanian, Serena Williams and Venus Williams and an extended investor group that includes Giannis Antetokounmpo, Alex Morgan and Shonda Rhimes.\n\nWhile he plans to move his family back home to Slovenia when the NHL season is done, taking a stake in LAGC gives Kopitar and his family a new way to stay connected to the community that he’s called his home and left his mark on for two decades.\n\n“It'll be a great excuse for me to come here and see everybody and be a part of this community like I've been for 20 years… Both of my kiddos were born here. We have friends outside of hockey here. Now this thing that popped up with LA Golf Club,” Kopitar said. “It’ll be very fun to come back here and maybe not be as stressed as I am during the season.\"\n\nLAGC's season kicked off with a Jan. 2 match against Boston Common Golf at SoFi Center in Palm Springs, Fla. that ended in a 7-5 victory for Boston Common, the first match of many that Kopitar will have the chance to watch as a new member of the organization.\n\n“Anže represents everything we value at LAGC, elite competition, leadership and a deep connection to Los Angeles. He’s a world-class athlete, a passionate golfer, and someone who understands what it means to represent this city at the highest level. We’re proud to welcome him into our investor group.” Hubman said in LAGC’s official announcement.",

    "description": "It’s possible they did, but Atletico could end that mini honeymoon quick",
    "fullText": "These observations — where I look at Real Madrid’s history, its players on loan, Castilla, tactical tidbits, and other relevant thoughts — are now a regular thing. All previous editions can be found here.\n\nI was asked on a recent Q&A, “if Xabi Alonso were to turn it around and win the Champions League this season, would it be a bigger feat than the 2022 Champions League triumph?”\n\nI had to think about it, and I still don’t have a clear cut answer. I lean towards a hypothetical 2026 Champions League triumph being a bigger achievement than the 2022 one, but only because of how improbable a 180-turnaround from the team seems now, given how gloomy things have been.\n\nBut then I remembered: In 2022, I wrote a column in the winter, on Real Madrid still being able to win the Champions League despite how bad they’ve been. The article was generally laughed at and dismissed. That team was not good enough, they said. Impossible — especially after getting played off the park, barely crossing the half-way line in a loss to PSG in Paris of the first of the Champions League round-of-16. Months later, Real Madrid lifted the Champions League trophy.\n\nThen I remembered another thing: I have an annual article, around this time — completely unintentional — talking about the same thing: ‘Real Madrid have been bad, but they generally don’t find themselves until the spring time’. In each case, it’s never well received.\n\nThis Real Madrid team has instilled little belief in fans, and even the biggest optimist would find it hard to believe in a turnaround. The regression is real. The promise from the Club World Cup, and early returns this season, have vanished. The press has regressed; the confidence zapped. Thibaut Courtois was taking naps earlier this season — now he’s back to being the team’s best player far too often. Alonso has compromised his original ideas in order to meet the players half way. He has lost himself, and it’s going to be hard to go back to his roots now.\n\nReal Madrid’s history cares little for any of this analysis. They would read these words of pessimism and light them on fire. This club is all about adversity and overcoming it. Nothing has ever come easy. In 2022, up until Real Madrid’s loss in Paris, the team looked dead, nowhere close to the elites. This particular team looks even worse. At least that one had Toni Kroos, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric still at their apex. This current team is largely inexperienced, and even among the veterans — apart from Courtois and Carvajal — there is a lack of leadership.\n\nThere is also an important detail that exists this season that didn’t exist in 2022: Xabi Alonso’s job could be over mid-January. The Spanish SuperCopa in Saudi Arabia is a huge litmus test for the Board, and unfortunately for Alonso, Real Madrid have to face two very dangerous teams: A team that is built to beat them (Atletico Madrid), and if they pass that test, they move on to the final to face a team, Barcelona, that is blood-thirsty for revenge.\n\nReal Madrid have not dealt well against teams with high intensity.\n\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find the last time the team put in a good performance for the entirety of 90 minutes. There are spurts of individual brilliance and heroics, but little to gloat about in terms of team chemistry and consistency. The team is in survival mode — reacting to things minute-to-minute among chaos. There is no dominance, no imposition of will. The result, overall, haven’t been great — the process is even worse.\n\nThe issues earlier on in the season are different than the issues now. In September, the team pressed well, created an abundance of chances, and couldn’t convert those forays to build a sizeable lead heading into the second half when the legs tired and the team regressed into a lower block. The morale was mostly good, and trending north.\n\nThings are more leg-heavy now, players are unhappy with their roles, and perhaps too eager to make use of the limited time they have not knowing when their next appearance might be. There is more pressure on the stars to float above, more pressure on the role players to produce in limited cameos, and more pressure on the coach to win. Two possible outcomes: The pressure cuts diamonds, or gives way to collapse.\n\nThere is a path to redemption. Not all is lost. If the glass half-empty look exists, there is also a glass half-full outlook: Real Madrid are hit with injuries to key players: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao. Eduardo Camavinga has barely played due to his health. Carvajal may return as early as the Super Cup (but that in itself is a problem if he’s rushed back). If the board can be patient enough for important defensive figures to return to stabilize the backline and bring some leadership, they can buy time for a possible spring rejuvenation.\n\nAlso, what if Real Madrid does win the Spanish SuperCup? How much momentum will that give them? Enough to launch them into orbit and escape the noise? Is such a thing improbable? Have we not learned enough lessons doubting Real Madrid by now over the past 50 years? Is that naive?\n\nThey still might be the best team in Spain when all is said and done. They still have the league’s best players. Tactically and collectively, they are still off pace from the elite: Arsenal, Bayern Munich, PSG — and possibly others. In the last two months, they’re dropped off even below the B-tier teams.\n\nBut it’s true the surrounding pieces around the young, inexperienced nucleus probably doesn’t have what it takes. Despite Mbappe’s devastating offensive form, Bellingham at his best, Gonzalo levitating against Real Betis, and Rodrygo rising, there is little confidence in the team’s two-way balance. Some of the midfield muscle has gotten stabilizing Eduardo Camavinga, rather than Arda Güler, supporting Jude Bellingham in midfield, but Camavinga also needs to stay fit — his health could swing the balance in a positive way. If both Güler and Camavinga are fit, I would wager Alonso bets on Camavinga for balance purposes in most games.\n\nBut even banking on good health is naive. When one key player returns, another key player is sidelined. Kylian Mbappe’s most recent injury is horrible news given how much the team relies on his pace in transition as well as his finishing and playmaking.\n\nIt’s an abysmally bad season when it comes to goal-scoring, even with Mbappe. Before the Real Betis game it was asked: how bad can it get without him? Before the win over the weekend, the team had only scored 36 goals from an xG of 45.2. It’s a painful number when you compare it to Barcelona’s up until the new year: 51 goals scored from an xG of 47.65. Only one team, Rayo Vallecano, has underperformed their xG even worse. In the Champions League, the numbers are a bit better: 13 goals from an xG of 13. Alonso will hope the league numbers will normalize.\n\nThe defensive numbers aren’t more encouraging. Despite conceding just 16 goals before Christmas, they conceded an xGA of 22.21. It was not good defense that had shut opponents out — it was Thibaut Courtois.\n\nA lot of that goes back to issues from seasons’ prior: the first line of defense has been catastrophic. Despite the pressing trending in a positive direction earlier this season (games against Marseille and Barcelona at home come to mind), it’s got dialled back to an unrecognizable level.\n\nIt’s hard to put into words what’s happenning here:\n\npic.twitter.com/dRSccNQS5u https://t.co/SHMnjN01CH\n\n— Managing Madrid (@managingmadrid) December 28, 2025\n\nThat’s Rodrygo doing everything he physically can. These are fundamentals: A press requires everyone to pull their weight. If there isn’t 100% buy in, you can’t hold a high line:\n\nRecurring thing in the last 2 months: back-line completely out of sync with where they stand, when to step, and when to keep their line. Wasn't as magnified when the press was working earlier this season. Now that the press is gone, you see more of thispic.twitter.com/ztjkcZvmKR\n\n— Kiyan Sobhani (@KiyanSo) January 1, 2026\n\nMore problems arise when the team is facing high pressure. The absences of Trent, Militao, and Carvajal haven’t helped, but the problems also run deeper. Players often make the wrong off-ball runs, show in the wrong areas, make the wrong pass, or delay the pass when quicker build-up is needed:\n\nThere are a couple situations in this clip where Trent would help. pic.twitter.com/mfWssfrmRF https://t.co/q5tbD8jIx7\n\n— Kiyan Sobhani (@KiyanSo) January 5, 2026\n\nThose build-up issues need to be sorted. By now, in an ideal world, Xabi Alonso’s blueprint would’ve been well-marinated into a machine that baits presses and exploits the space in behind, with plenty of attacking weapons to help Real Madrid punish teams who dare to push bodies forward.\n\nThe build-up will become even more strenuous on Thursday against Atletico Madrid. Diego Simeone’s men are masters at hoodwinking you into thinking a passing lane is open. They congest the strong side, invite a switch, and rotate so quickly defensively, you’ll lose the outlet before it even appears.\n\nAnd that’s where Real Madrid will be tested perhaps the most all month, and the Real Betis honeymoon could soon end. There is perhaps no greater thorn in Real Madrid’s side than Atleti — a team whose hearts Real Madrid have shattered on the biggest stage over and over again, but a team that can close space and irritate like no other.\n\nBut it’s also an opportunity to carry the momentum from the Betis game, ride the Gonzalo Garcia heatwave, and carry that energy forward to the Super Cup Final and beyond.\n\nReal Madrid lose a lot without Mbappe, who is probably the best player in the world. There is no discussion about whether or not Mbappe helps the team. However, Real Madrid do gain two things with Gonzalo Garcia starting in lieu of the injured French Superstar: A better first line of defense, and a target in the box.\n\nReal Madrid will need both those things. Atletico Madrid would rather not have their center-backs — of late David Hancko and Marc Pubill — occupied. Gonzalo commands gravity and is an expert off-ball mover in the box. Real Madrid can leverage that skill into creating space for others — Rodrygo making diagonal runs in the box, Jude Bellingham crashing it, Vinicius Jr cutting in.\n\nReal Madrid can stifle Atletico’s build-up, spearheaded by Gonzalo’s effort:\n\nReal Madrid may be better off with only one of Vinicius or Mbappe on the field; pairing one of them with a more natural link-up striker (Gonzalo) that they can play off of. The sample size of Gonzalo plus one of them (mostly Vinicius due to Mbappe’s injuries in the Club World Cup and now), is small, but mostly effective. The sample size with Vinicus and Mbappe together is much larger, but not clicking as it should be. We have virtually zero sample size of Gonzalo and Mbappe together, but it would be fascinating to see a theoretical partnership with them to see what they could cook. Mbappe likes to hang back and receive cut-backs; Gonzalo likes to shake off his marker and attack the six-yard box — that would create space for Mbappe and pull defenders around. That kind of offense doesn’t exist if Gonzalo isn’t on the field.\n\nIt is true that Real Madrid have struggles outside their front line. The defense has looked frail dancing on the high line, and the midfield has gotten overrun more than once. But the problems do, in a lot of ways, start up top — the midfield will always be outnumbered by opponents if the first line of defense is broken. That’s where you can make the case for more Gonzalo and more Rodrygo to balance the team. Valverde’s eventual return to midfield with Carvajal and Trent coming back should help Bellingham, Tchouameni, and Camavinga as well.\n\nBut Alonso can address those questions in the Super Cup Final (if Real Madrid qualify) and beyond. The attack and line-up against Atletico picks itself: copy and pasted from the win over Betis. There is one slight question mark: Dean Huijsen, who is back with the team. But logic suggests Huijsen would not be ready to start a game of this magnitude as his first game back, especially after he struggled with Atletico’s high press in the 5 – 2 debacle earlier this season.\n\n“I think every match has to be analysed, but all defeats, if anything, can teach us more positive lessons,” Alonso said in Wednesday’s pre-game press conference. “There are things we don’t want to repeat from that match, things that we obviously took away from it, but I’m very convinced that it’s going to be different. We mustn’t forget the things that didn’t work well either.”\n\nAtletico are struggling since that 5 – 2 Derby — but they were struggling in the build-up to that game as well. They had gone winless against Espanyol, Elche, Alaves, Liverpool, and Mallorca. Antoine Griezmann hadn’t scored a goal for 22 consecutive matches. But then Griezmann scored against Real Madrid, Atletico pounded Real Madrid on set-pieces and crosses, and pressed them relentlessly.\n\nThis time it’s Julian Alvarez’s turn to go through a drought (he’s scored just one goal since that aforementioned Derby), and Atletico are coming off a poor showing against Real Sociedad. Pablo Barrios, their most important midfielder this season, is injured. Atletico are also defanged away from home (they’ve earned just 13 points out of a possible 30 this season away from the Metropolitano).\n\nStill — you know that all goes out the window on Thursday. Atletico will be blood-hungry, as they always are against Real Madrid — and if Real Madrid don’t exceed that intensity, it’s going to be tough to win a must-win Derby.",

    "fullText": "The crypto market was spared a blow this week after indexing giant MSCI opted not to delist crypto holding companies from its indexes.\n\nMSCI decided not to proceed with a proposal to exclude digital asset treasuries from its indexes, though it said it would conduct a wider review of how some companies are treated.\n\nThe move spares companies like Strategy and other firms whose main business is buying and holding crypto from a potentially devastating blow. If MSCI dumped those stocks, many investors who track its indexes would have likely followed suit. However, it leaves the door open to a crackdown in the future.\n\nStrategy stock spiked as much as 5% on the news.\n\nWhen the MSCI first said it was considering excluding firms with 50% or more assets in crypto, the idea sparked strong backlash from the industry. MSCI's argument was that crypto treasuries are more like investment funds than operating companies, and should be treated differently for the purposes of inclusion in some of its world indexes.\n\nFrank Chaparro, head of content at crypto market maker GSR, said that the updates is a subtle but important developement for the crypto market, which is still fragile following the market meltdown sent prices plummeting in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"As leverage unwound and sentiment around these structures deteriorated, weakness in DAT equities spilled over into broader crypto risk appetite,\" he told Business Insider. \"Against that backdrop, any credible bullish catalyst for the space, particularly one tied to index inclusion and institutional access, carries outsized signaling value right now.\"\n\nChaparro added that while many exchange platforms offer investors the opportunity to purchase crypto, the majority of traders still opt to gain exposure through funds and other index-linked products.\n\nThat said, MSCI signaled that it plans to embark on a broader consultation over how \"non-operating companies\" should be treated. Another bout of uncertainty related to indexing could create fresh headwinds for Strategy and other companies that hoard crypto on their balance sheets.\n\nChaparro said that he thinks this strong scrutiny on the part of the index is justified, highlighting the importance of holding DATs to high standards\n\n\"Companies that function more like investment funds than operating businesses with bitcoin as a core treasury asset should be evaluated differently and potentially excluded,\" he said. \"Clear and consistent criteria will be essential to preserve index integrity as these structures proliferate.\"",

    "title": "My friend and I hold presentation nights. We get to know each other better, and it helps us understand who we are now.",
    "description": "Two women deepened a fast friendship with monthly presentation nights, using photos and stories to share their histories and connect more deeply.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rachel Jones, cohost of the \"Is It Normal\" podcast. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was recently introduced to Eloisa by a mutual friend who was certain we'd become fast friends.\n\nThat friend was right, because Eloisa and I clicked straight away. We shared similar interests — books and art — and had this chemistry that I can't quite explain. I knew we'd be best friends.\n\nAs we began to get to know each other, both of us keen to \"dig deep\" and understand each other as fully as possible, we would often say things like, \"To understand this part of me, you need some context.\"\n\nAlthough we would have liked to jump into each other's histories, we were limited by time constraints.\n\nI work full-time, volunteer, own a house, participate heavily in church activities, and have family and friends I'm already committed to. Eloisa has a husband and is a full-time student. We're both very busy people, but we're keen to connect on a deeper level because neither of us wants coffee-once-a-month friendships.\n\nIn your late teens and early 20s, forming friendships is relatively easy, as people often have less responsibility and more time. But the older you get, the harder it can be to form meaningful relationships — because there are only so many hours in a day. And yet, when you meet friends at an older age, there is so much more life to catch up on, just not the time to do it.\n\nI'd seen on social media a trending way to get to know friends as adults — presentation evenings. Each person involved gives a short presentation about themselves, which may include both serious and humorous topics.\n\nTypically, people create slideshows with lots of pictures to accompany whatever is being presented. I'd seen a huge range of topics: what's my love language, favorite books, favorite memories, teenage years, and the list of ideas for these nights goes on and on.\n\nExcited about the possibility, I asked Eloisa if she'd be up for it, and as I suspected, she couldn't wait.\n\nFor our first presentation night, we decided to kick off our monthly series by sharing stories about our childhoods.\n\nJust the process of preparing my slideshow was precious. I went through dozens of photos of my family, reflecting on the significant changes I experienced as a child, and remembering how fortunate I was to grow up in such a close-knit family with my parents and three siblings.\n\nWe planned to present after dinner one evening, both allowing each other to share without interruption.\n\nWhen I'm typically getting to know a friend just through conversation, both of us are lovingly interrupting each other, interjecting thoughts in response to what the other person has said. But in presenting, you're quiet when it isn't your turn, so the listener has a chance to fully absorb what the other person says.\n\nI listened to Eloise speak about her childhood, and I immediately could piece together why she is the way she is because of her history.\n\nWhen I presented, I methodically talked about my birthday, my parents, my siblings, and how I had lived in several houses in multiple countries.\n\nIt was a lighthearted theme, but even so, she now understands why stability is so important to me, and why I tend to crave acceptance from people. A lot of that is down to my childhood.\n\nAs a visual learner, I found the presentation night so helpful in remembering the people Eloise spoke about. So now, when she tells me about her sister, I can visualize her sister and recall Eloise's relationship with her growing up. Facts about Eloise get ingrained in my memory because I've had photos and so much context.\n\nI expect that as we hold these presentation nights more frequently — we're hoping to do them monthly — we'll get to know each other better, both on a serious and a silly level.\n\nAs we continue to be friends, carrying on with these presentations, we'll understand each other's triggers more and be able to respond better and give informed advice.\n\nIt's the first time I've had presentation nights with a friend, but I suspect I'll bring in other friends to join us on our evenings. I also think it would be a really helpful thing to do with a boyfriend or partner in the future.\n\nThe fact that Eloise wanted to have these presentation nights with me felt like a privilege, because it's someone who wants to know me and invest in our friendship.\n\nTo be known and feel seen is one of the greatest desires we have a humans, and these presentations provide a way to do this in our busy, modern, adulting worlds.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump took a big swing at business on Wednesday — saying he would put a stop to practices he deemed undesirable at defense firms and large housing investors.\n\nIn a series of posts on Truth Social, the president said he wants to ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes in the US. He also criticized defense firms' issuing dividends, stock buybacks, and \"exorbitant\" pay packages — and called out Raytheon by name. The market reacted quickly: Shares for private equity firm Blackstone and defense stocks dropped immediately following Trump's posts.\n\nWednesday evening, Trump issued an executive order aimed at defense firms, stating, \"Effective immediately, they are not permitted in any way, shape, or form to pay dividends or buy back stock, until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\nIt's the latest example of Trump taking steps to insert himself into business, having taken equity stakes in several companies over the last year. (See Business Insider's new series on \"The Future of Capitalism.)\n\nMany housing economists agree that banning large investors from buying or owning single-family homes would likely do little nationally to improve housing affordability, which has deteriorated in large part because of a shortage of homes. \n\n\"If we actually wanted to solve that problem, bringing down the cost of home ownership, what we should be doing is increasing the supply of housing,\" Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, told Business Insider.\n\nBusiness Insider's James Rodriguez has reported that, despite being the \"villains\" of the housing market, large investors don't actually own a significant portion of America's homes.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors with at least 10 units in their portfolio owned roughly 3.4% of all single-family homes in the country. Big investors with at least 1,000 units — a group that includes major companies such as AMH Homes, Invitation Homes, Tricon Residential, and Pretium — owned just 0.73% of units.\n\nThat share is much higher in certain housing markets, particularly in the southeast.\n\nIt's unclear if Trump will be able to stop future payouts from defense firms. The one he singled out, Raytheon, for example, announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023, and said it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.\n\nIn his posts, Trump said Raytheon \"has been the least responsive,\" \"the slowest,\" and the \"most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military.\"\n\nOf defense firms overall, he said that until they build \"NEW and MODERN Production Plants\" their executives' pay should be capped at $5 million.",

    "description": "Amazon updates its performance review system to require corporate employees share specific work achievements.",
    "fullText": "Amazon has a new question for its corporate workforce: What did you get done last year?\n\nAs part of this year's performance review process, known internally as Forte, Amazon is asking corporate employees to submit three to five \"accomplishments\" that best reflect their work, according to people familiar with the matter and an internal guideline obtained by Business Insider.\n\nEmployees are required to provide \"specific examples\" of what they delivered, along with actions they plan to take to continue growing at the company, the guideline added.\n\n\"Accomplishments are specific projects, goals, initiatives, or process improvements that show the impact of your work,\" the internal guideline states. \"Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn't lead to the results you hoped for.\"\n\nThis marks the first time Amazon has explicitly formalized Forte around individual accomplishments, according to the people. They asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.\n\nWhile the company has long included a self-assessment component, past reviews asked employees broader questions about their \"super powers,\" areas of interest, and questions like, \"When you're at your best, how do you contribute?\" An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nForte is a key driver of employee compensation. Managers also consider peer feedback, adherence to Amazon's Leadership Principles, and job-specific skills to assign an \"Overall Value\" rating, which determines annual pay.\n\nThe move reflects Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's continued push to build a more disciplined workforce and a more unified corporate culture. Last year, he enforced a full return-to-office policy, cut management layers, and overhauled Amazon's pay model and performance review process to more clearly reward top performers.\n\nThis is part of a broader change in how tech companies treat employees. After years of mollycoddling talent, the industry has become tougher. Elon Musk started this in 2022, by demanding to know what Twitter employees accomplished each week. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed suit with his year of intensity. Even Google has toughened up.\n\nSome teams at Amazon, including the advertising and the IMDb video units, began pilot-testing a similar Forte question a few years ago. At the time, advertising chief Paul Kotas told employees that sharing specific accomplishments \"helps facilitate a more productive\" conversation with managers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Kennedy said his new guidelines undo previous advice. Full fat dairy is back, sugar is out, and highly processed foods come under fire.",
    "fullText": "That's the stated intention of the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, released Wednesday by the federal government.\n\n\"Real food is back at the center of the American diet,\" a video from the Department of Health and Human Services says, on the government's new realfood.gov website.\n\nThe federal guidelines, which are updated every five years, serve as a guidepost for nutrition and health advice and form the basis for federal food programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, as well as meals and snacks for the military, veterans, and preschoolers in Head Start.\n\nThe new realfood.gov site claims that Americans have been \"misled\" by previous guidelines, an idea that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. echoed Wednesday at the White House.\n\n\"The hard truth is that our government has been lying to us to protect corporate profit-taking, telling us that these food-like substances were beneficial to public health,\" he said. \"These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation's food culture and Make America Healthy Again.\"\n\nIn 1992, the food pyramid was introduced into the guidelines, encouraging bread and pasta to form the basis of the American diet:\n\nThe original food pyramid has been heavily criticized for being too cozy with food lobbyists, particularly in the grains industry, as it prioritized more bread, cereal, rice, and pasta than sound nutrition advice would recommend.\n\nIt was replaced in 2011 by \"My Plate,\" a new framework meant to simplify how people thought about building their daily meals. Vegetables, protein, and grains were prominent on the plate, with an emphasis on consuming more whole grains:\n\nUnder Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" campaign, a new upside-down pyramid was unveiled on Wednesday:\n\nThe new pyramid deliberately de-prioritizes whole grains by flipping the triangle upside down — even though it's not a true inversion of the old pyramid, which had \"bad\" ingredients, like sweets, fats, and oils, at the top.\n\nThe new pyramid has as its cornerstone protein and \"healthy\" fat, which Kennedy said \"are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines.\"\n\nFor the first time, the new guidelines encourage people to prioritize \"high-quality, nutrient-dense\" protein at each meal.\n\nAnimal sources are recommended, such as eggs, poultry, seafood, and red meat, even though most nutritionists would encourage a focus on lean proteins like chicken, fish, and plants like beans, nuts, and seeds, with less red meat.\n\nThe daily protein serving goal, at 1.2-1.6 grams per kilogram of your body weight, is generally in line with what dietitians and protein experts recommend. For example, a 150-pound person would be aiming for about 82 to 109 grams of protein every day on this plan, far more than previous guidelines would suggest.\n\n\"We are ending the war on saturated fats,\" Kennedy said Wednesday.\n\nThe new guidelines encourage consumers to \"include full-fat dairy,\" which is a somewhat controversial stance among nutritionists, especially when it comes to foods like butter and milk.\n\nChristopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford who was on the expert panel convened in 2024 to advise health authorities on the new dietary guidelines, had said in a previous committee meeting that \"butter is not back\" — at least, not according to any new scientific data.\n\nGardner raised concerns about how butter can raise your LDL cholesterol, in particular, affecting the arteries.\n\nThere is more scientific debate about full-fat cheese and full-fat yogurt, because of the unique ways that calcium and protein are arranged in those foods.\n\nThe new guidelines also highlight the importance of fermented foods, including the dairy item kefir, for promoting a healthy microbiome, which is something nutrition experts and scientists are increasingly emphasizing.\n\nUltra-processed foods are in the crosshairs of the new guidelines. Evidence has been mounting for years that these foods tend to make people eat more calories, and can promote inflammation and, over time, contribute to chronic health issues.\n\n\"If a foreign adversary sought to destroy the health of our children, to cripple our economy, to weaken our national security, there would be no better strategy than to addict us to ultra-processed foods,\" Kennedy said.\n\nNutrition experts say it's generally true that ultra-processed foods are not great, but the composition of those foods still matters. UPFs with more vegetables and whole grains in them are better choices than sugary beverages and sweets. Some studies have suggested that certain ultra-processed items like packaged yogurts with added sugar and industrial whole-grain cereals may not be so detrimental to our health after all.\n\nIn the new pyramid, there is no place for a sugar bowl, because \"added sugars are not part of eating real foods.\"\n\nThe new pyramid recommended avoiding added sugars entirely, while allowing naturally occurring sugar from fruit and dairy.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading sources of added sugar in the American diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks, so though it may be challenging to nix all added sugar in your diet, given the food landscape we live in, cutting back on those items is a simple place to start.",

    "title": "Hegseth's prosecution of Mark Kelly sends a chilling message to US troops and veterans, legal analysts say",
    "description": "Experts said Hegseth's language suggests a predetermined outcome, and that the repercussions could impact troops and retirees.",
    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's extraordinary move to demote a retired military veteran in the Senate comes after weeks of threats for more severe punishment, and experts on military law said it has implications for speech by troops and retired military.\n\nThe highly public decision to censure Democratic Sen. Mark Kelley and to possibly dock his military pension is likely to make military retirees think twice before publicly criticizing the Trump administration, two former military lawyers said. About 2 million people receive military retirement benefits in the US. Some retired military leaders have been strident critics of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe defense secretary announced the decision to review Kelly, a retired Navy captain and astronaut who represents Arizona, for a reduction in his retired grade and pay on Monday, saying the senator's public statements, including a video in which he told US troops not to follow illegal orders, amount to sedition. The two experts on military law said they believe Kelly would have strong grounds to challenge it through the Defense Department's processes or in federal court.\n\nHegseth said the process would be completed within 45 days, and added that he issued a formal censure letter, \"which outlines the totality of Captain (for now) Kelly's reckless misconduct. This Censure is a necessary process step, and will be placed in Captain Kelly's official and permanent military personnel file.\"\n\nDon C. King, a retired Navy judge advocate general who now owns the King Military Law firm, said the fact that the statement was posted by Hegseth on X is \"very unusual\" and ensures the actions against Kelly are well publicized. \"I've never seen that happen before.\"\n\nHegseth's public comments could give Kelly grounds to argue that the grade determination board, made up of military officers, is predisposed to punish the misconduct that the defense secretary alleged and in the way he suggested it.\n\nHegseth's statement \"strongly suggests a predetermined outcome,\" Daniel Maurer, a law professor at Ohio Northern University and a retired Army judge advocate general, said. \"It is the opposite of a measured, unbiased, and due process-focused announcement that protects the integrity of the process and rights of the service member.\"\n\nKelly's actions, Maurer argued, don't meet the definition of sedition under federal law. \"What he said was a restatement of the law and a professional duty,\" he noted; the official manual for courts-martial says service members may disobey a \"patently illegal order.\"\n\nHegseth previously threatened to court-martial Kelly, which likely didn't move forward because of a lack of evidence, experts said. It nonetheless has profound implications for serving officers, whose careers can be marred or effectively ended for having lost their superior's confidence.\n\nHegseth called Kelly's comments seditious in the Monday X post: \"This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay.\"\n\nHegseth cited 10 U.S.C. § 1370(f), a subsection of the Title 10 Armed Forces law, in his decision. Per federal code, military officers are retired in the highest rank \"served satisfactorily,\" and that determines the officer's pension. By law, officer grade determination is based on the officer's conduct while on active duty, not post-retirement.\n\nThe code establishes the reconsideration of an officer's retirement rank as possible under only four reasons. The first is if their rank was procured by fraud. The second is based on whether substantial evidence for revisiting retirement rank comes out afterward, but that's contemplating actions that occurred while the person was on active duty. The third is if a mistake was made in determining the retired grade. None of those applies to Kelly's case.\n\nThe fourth, which experts believe is what Hegseth is referring to, is if the defense secretary determines \"that good cause exists to reopen the determination of retired grade.\"\n\nIt's a fuzzy argument, though. \"I don't see a strong legal case for what Secretary Hegseth is purporting to do,\" King said. \"I don't know that this law supports what he's trying to do.\"\n\nFollowing the review and board recommendation, it's likely that Hegseth's decision could be overturned in court. It would be a \"strong sign\" for the speech rights of service members, Maurer told BI. Kelly may also have additional protections as an elected federal lawmaker under the Constitution's speech and debate clause.\n\nKelly, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made comments in the video released before new allegations emerged in late November about the US military's move to fire a missile at a boat it had already struck. The Pentagon's law of war manual calls an attack on shipwreck survivors illegal.\n\nNow, Kelly has 30 days to submit a response to the proceedings. In a public statement online, the senator said he'd fight back and added: \"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired service member that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way.\"\n\nThat appears to be a consequence of this, Maurer said, which he called \"a chilling effect on retired officers, especially senior-ranking\" ones.\n\nKelly's unusual case comes against the backdrop of a broader crackdown on what military personnel say and post, especially regarding the US' strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, progressive politics, and the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Some troops have sought to self-censor for fear of retaliation.",

    "description": "The Trump administration's new dietary guidelines recommend Americans eat more full-fat dairy. This contradicts established nutrition advice.",
    "fullText": "Dairy started to roar back into fashion in 2025 — and if the Trump administration's new dietary guidelines are anything to go by, it could be about to reach new heights.\n\nThe 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which provide Americans with a framework for what the government considers a healthy diet, advise people to aim for three servings of full-fat dairy per day. The document, released on Wednesday, name-checks butter, whole milk, and \"real\" cheese.\n\nIn the past two years, dairy has had a glow-up as innovative products, blending health and food trends with dairy staples, hit the market. Think indie brands selling cinnamon bun butter and mint chocolate-chip probiotic ice cream, and Fairlife Ultra-filtered milk becoming more popular than ever. Dairy is typically minimally processed, high in protein, and fermented versions are good for gut health.\n\nBut the new guidance contradicts a strong body of evidence linking a diet high in full-fat dairy products and red or processed meat, which are high in saturated fats, to cardiovascular disease.\n\nRecommending full-fat dairy like butter is a big pivot from the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encouraged us to \"move to low-fat or fat-free dairy milk or yogurt or lactose-free dairy or fortified make half soy versions.\"\n\nThis was partly why plant-based diets and alt-milks became hot commodities in the 2010s. Then, some shoppers started to wonder if some of types of products were high enough in protein and more processed than they'd realized.\n\nIn 2024, the organic dairy sector grew by 9.8% up from 5.6% the previous year, according to data shared with Business Insider last year by New Hope Network, an organic-focused consultancy firm. This is far higher than the one or two percent a year increase seen since around 2015.\n\nDuring this time, whole dairy products like raw milk and home-churned butter have become synonymous with the Make America Healthy Again movement helmed by the health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an architect of the new guidelines. It's all part of the conservative vibe shift of the past year.\n\nRFK Jr. said Wednesday these new guidelines are \"how we Make America Healthy Again,\" but public health experts have been quick to point out their contradictions.\n\nNeal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, said that the guidelines recommend limiting cholesterol-raising \"bad\" or saturated fat, while simultaneously promoting red meat and full-fat dairy products.",

    "description": "Taiwan is searching for a missing F-16 fighter jet and pilot after an incident earlier this week.",
    "fullText": "Taiwan's air force has grounded its F-16 fleet and suspended training missions on the jet after one of the planes and the pilot went missing earlier this week.\n\nThe search continues for the pilot and aircraft, which officials believe went down following an in-flight \"anomaly,\" but rough seas off the island have made efforts difficult.\n\nOn Tuesday night local time, an American-made F-16 fighter jet assigned to the Taiwan Air Force's Fifth Tactical Air Wing operating out of Hualien Air Base went missing in the waters off the northeast coast of the island. The Air Force said the fighter was separated from a group during a nighttime training session after the jets entered cloud cover.\n\nThe F-16 suddenly descended quickly. Its altitude was just 1,700 feet when radar contact was lost. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has identified the missing pilot as Capt. Hsin Po-yi. Officials remain unsure whether Hsin successfully ejected from the aircraft, although he had indicated he would eject seconds before the aircraft disappeared. It's unclear if he did.\n\nIn the days since the incident, a search and rescue mission has been ongoing in the waters off Hualien County. Multiple aircraft and vessels have been involved in the mission, but tall waves and strong winds have been complicating the search for the jet and Hsin.\n\nAir Force officials told reporters during a press conference on Wednesday that there appeared to be a malfunction of the F-16's main onboard computer in which the aircraft's flight path was no longer displayed.\n\nNow, Taiwanese air force officials have grounded all of Taiwan's F-16 fleet for inspections, and training missions have been temporarily suspended. Taiwan currently has about 140 F-16s, the older A/B models, that it has upgraded in recent years. It is expected to receive a batch of the newer F-16V or Viper jets in the coming years to add to its fleet.\n\nThe F-16 is made by American defense giant Lockheed Martin. Though it's been flying for over 50 years, it still represents a highly capable fourth-generation jet. The newest operator of the aircraft is Ukraine, which received a limited number from NATO partner nations.\n\nThis crash involving the Taiwanese military follows a similar incident that occurred in January 2022, when a Taiwanese F-16 went down off the island's west coast while taking part in training exercises. At the time, the F-16 went missing after taking off from Chiayi Air Base in southern Taiwan. In response, Taiwan suspended its combat training for the fleet.\n\nIt's not uncommon to see fleets grounded after accidents, especially if the cause is unclear. The US military has done this regularly.\n\nTaiwan's Air Force has been strained in recent years by constant scrambling to track Chinese military aircraft, which regularly fly into the country's air defense identification zone. Taipei's smaller air force has experienced higher operational tempos that have exhausted pilots, aircraft, and resources and stressed maintainers. Most recently, Taiwan held rapid response drills in reaction to China's massive exercises nearby.",

    "description": "The new MDs hail from groups including investment banking and investing, as the bank rides renewed dealmaking momentum heading into the new year.",
    "fullText": "New Year's Eve is behind us, but if you hear the sound of bottles popping — it might be coming from the halls of Morgan Stanley's headquarters.\n\nThe Wall Street bank on Wednesday announced the appointment of 184 new managing directors — a roughly 6% increase from last year's class of 173 MDs.\n\nAt Morgan Stanley, managing director is the firm's highest designation. The announcement comes amid the annual promotion season on Wall Street and follows Goldman Sachs' November elevation of more than 600 managing directors, part of a biennial process at the rival firm.\n\nThe size of each of Morgan Stanley's annual MD classes has fluctuated. In 2024, the bank named 155 managing directors. In 2023, it also appointed 184; and in 2022, it elevated 199.\n\nSeventy percent of the newly appointed execs work in a revenue-generating capacity, interacting with clients and making the bank money, while 30% work in middle- and back-office or corporate functions.\n\nThe promotions come after a strong year for the firm's dealmaking business. Morgan Stanley finished third on the worldwide M&A financial advisory league tables, according to LSEG, trailing only Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.\n\nIt ended the year advising on more than $1 trillion in deal value across more than 400 transactions, LSEG's December data show. That marked a significant jump from the prior year, when the bank advised on roughly $707 billion in deals across 368 mergers or acquisitions.\n\nAcross Wall Street, headhunters and investment bankers have told Business Insider in recent weeks that they expect 2026 to generate robust activity in mergers and the capital markets. That backdrop may help explain why 48% of Morgan Stanley's new managing directors came from its Institutional Securities Group, which advises corporate clients on IPOs, buyouts, and sales.\n\nThe bank informed the newly elevated executives on Wednesday and is expected to release the full list of names publicly in the coming days. The firm has also communicated bonuses to its employees, one of the first on Wall Street to inform workers how their contributions from last year resulted in their incentive compensation.\n\nBelow is a look at the statistics Morgan Stanley shared about the composition of its 2026 managing director class.\n\n70% in Revenue, 30% in Infrastructure, the firm's middle- and back-office or corporate functions.\n\nRegionally, Americas 67%, EMEA 18%, Asia 14%\n\nOf US-based MD promotes, 31% of the class are ethnically diverse and 69% are White.",

    "description": "Avelo Airlines began operating deportation flights in May and has seen protests and calls for boycotts in response.",
    "fullText": "It turns out that deporting people for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency isn't the profit booster Avelo Airlines had hoped.\n\nThe budget airline announced a new network strategy on Tuesday designed to strengthen its balance sheet after years of inconsistent earnings, including the closure of several bases and the removal of six aircraft from its fleet.\n\nAmong the closures is Mesa, Arizona — the core of Avelo's chartered aircraft support for the federal government's highly controversial mass deportations. A company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that this also means the end of its ICE contract.\n\n\"Avelo will close the base at [Mesa] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,\" they said. \"The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.\"\n\nThe airline began operating these deportation flights in May but received significant backlash from travelers and faced protests at airports like Albany, Burbank, and New Haven, Connecticut. Avelo has not disclosed the amount it has received from the government.\n\nIt has also downplayed the political optics.\n\nAvelo's CEO, Andrew Levy, previously framed the decision to fly migrants out of the US as financially driven, acknowledging that it is a \"sensitive and complicated topic,\" but said the ICE charters would provide the company with stability and keep its crew members employed.\n\nA spokesperson in April said that Avelo had also operated deportation flights under the Biden Administration.\n\n\"Regardless of the administration or party affiliation, as a US flag carrier, when our country calls and requests assistance, our practice is to say 'yes,'\" they said. \"We follow all protocols from DHS and FAA, honoring our core value of safety always.\"\n\nCharter airlines Miami-based Global Crossing Airlines and Kansas City-based Eastern Air Express have long carried out deportations on behalf of ICE. GlobalX, for example, said its five-year contract awarded in 2024 is expected to generate roughly $65 million in annual revenue.\n\nBut activists said Avelo's involvement reflects a broader shift in the deportation system, as it's unusual for scheduled commercial airlines like Avelo to dedicate aircraft and crews to ICE flights.\n\nThis focal point of criticism coincides with the broader expansion of deportation activity under the Trump Administration that prompted ICE's need to enlist additional operators.\n\nThere were nearly 12,000 deportation, domestic shuttle, and other removal-related flights across operators between President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20 and November 30, 2025, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Human Rights First.\n\nThe Avelo flights are also reportedly not meeting the expected safety standards. Avelo's flight attendant union said in a September memo to Avelo management that the cabin crew \"were discouraged or prohibited from performing safety checks and cabin walk-throughs required by the FAA.\"\n\nIt added that there weren't any aircraft modifications that would allow restrained passengers to evacuate during an emergency.\n\nThe cabin crew working these ICE flights were specifically hired for this role, as were pilots and mechanics. According to the April cabin crew listing, pay started at $28 per hour.\n\nAvelo's operation once stretched coast-to-coast as the airline expanded aggressively into new markets in search of demand.\n\nBut competition intensified, and Avelo struggled to achieve consistent profitability as rivals like Breeze Airways — along with legacy carriers offering low-cost basic economy fares — lured away price-sensitive customers.\n\nThe airline has been reshaping its network and fleet in response to those pressures for years.\n\nAs part of that retrenchment — and beyond the now-deemed money-losing ICE flights — Avelo announced an order for Embraer E195-E2 aircraft, a smaller regional jet that marks a shift away from its traditionally all-Boeing fleet.\n\nAvelo also closed its entire West Coast operation in October due to low demand and pivoted its focus to the East Coast. The carrier also plans to exit its base at Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, in January, axing routes to Montego Bay and Cancún. The airline cited revenue underperformance.\n\nFurther, Avelo is closing bases in Raleigh and Wilmington, North Carolina. It will instead focus its operations out of four core airports: New Haven, Connecticut; Wilmington, Delaware; Charlotte, North Carolina — operating out of the city's smaller Concord-Padgett Regional Airport — and Lakeland, Florida.\n\nAvelo said it plans to open a base in McKinney, Texas, near Dallas, in late 2026.\n\nThis pivot reinforces the airline's strategy of connecting secondary airports to larger cities while still accessible to major metropolitan areas — for example, its Delaware base serves the Philadelphia region, and Lakeland sits between Orlando and Tampa.\n\n\"These changes enable Avelo to focus on sustainably scaling five core bases in 2026 and to prepare the company for growth in the coming years, facilitated by the company's recent order for up to 100 Embraer 195-E2 aircraft,\" the company said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump took executive action aimed at defense contractors after a series of Truth Social posts.\n\nThe president signed an executive order on Wednesday that would ban defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\n\"Every firm across our economy has a right to profit from prudent investment and hard work, but the American defense industrial base also has the responsibility to ensure that America's warfighters have the best possible equipment and weapons,\" the order said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump said he would \"not permit\" stock buybacks or dividends from US defense companies in a post on Truth Social.\n\nIn his post, the president blasted defense contractors for issuing \"massive\" dividends and buying back their stock. He said he wouldn't permit such practices until defense firms sped up production.\n\n\"Therefore, I will not permit Dividends or Stock Buybacks for Defense Companies until such time as these problems are rectified,\" he wrote. \"MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH!\"\n\nTrump also took issue with what he called \"exorbitant and unjustifiable\" compensation packages for industry executives. Until companies build \"NEW and MODERN\" production plants, defense execs should be making no more than $5 million, he said, without providing details on how those guidelines would be implemented.\n\nHe later singled out Raytheon in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nDefense stocks fell after Trump's Truth Social post on Wednesday. Notable movers include:\n\nThe defense sector has been a big focus for Trump dating back to his first term as president. In the past year, he's floated projects like creating a Golden Dome missile defense system and signed off on increasing defense spending to a record $901 billion.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's leveraged buyout bid again, citing financial and litigation risk",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board raised its hackles on Wednesday while rejecting Paramount Skydance's bid for the eighth time in favor of Netflix's offer.\n\nWBD used pointed language, calling Paramount's bid the \"largest leveraged buyout in history by a wide margin\" and tying its potential failure to previous big LBOs that didn't close on the initially agreed-upon terms.\n\nIn its new filing, WBD also described Paramount's financial condition as \"not strong,\" noting that its credit was already rated \"junk\" by S&P before the \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" required by the deal. Paramount, for its part, has emphasized that $40.4 billion in equity of its new bid is fully backstopped by Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nWBD's strong language suggests that the board and leadership \"just want to move on,\" and the \"largest LBO\" angle is a new and compelling one, Wharton M&A professor Paul Nary said on X.\n\nDavid Zaslav-led WBD also ramped up its accusations that Paramount has acted litigiously and leaked to the press.\n\nIn the filing, WBD cited new press reports in the New York Post indicating Paramount was considering abandoning its offer and might pursue \"DefCon 1\" litigation against WBD's board. WBD said that Paramount didn't deny the reports, suggesting that the company was leaking to the press. WBD had previously complained that there had been \"extensive media leaks and rumors\" about Paramount's proposals.\n\nM&A experts said the stepped-up language was likely drafted in anticipation of a lawsuit against WBD, either by Paramount or WBD shareholders.\n\nNow that Paramount has lost to Netflix, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit,\" said Raul Gastesi, a partner at Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella.\n\nCorey Martin, managing partner of Granderson Des Rochers, a law firm focused on entertainment and media, said the new filing felt calibrated to deter WBD shareholders from backing Paramount's hostile bid.\n\n\"The audience is really the shareholders, because there's always the risk of shareholder lawsuits,\" Martin said. \"It is colorful stuff, but Paramount's is a hostile bid.\"\n\nMartin also saw the emphasis on legal and press tactics as part of a PR strategy to portray Paramount as a bad actor, as well as a pre-litigation tactic.\n\nLightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a note on Wednesday that Paramount could still outbid Netflix, but it would \"require an overhaul of their current bid, and a dramatic increase in the cash invested from the Ellison family and/or their friends and financing partners.\"",

One statement piece that caught my eye is the Abbyson Home display cabinet.\n\nIt comes in a beautiful rich, dark finish that complements a range of styles, and would be great for displaying decor and collectibles in a home or office.\n\nThe new blueberry cheesecake croissants in the bakery section have been selling quickly at my store.\n\nThese flaky, buttery pastries are stuffed with a rich, creamy blueberry cheesecake filling. The bottom is also caramelized for a nice crunchy finish.\n\nThe Italian-style Tutta Bella margherita pizzas are an easy weeknight dinner option, found in the Costco deli coolers.\n\nThey come in a pack of two and are great to keep in the freezer for nights when cooking sounds like a chore.\n\nIf you're looking for a high-resolution home security camera, the Reolink system may be a good option.\n\nThe bundle comes with eight weatherproof cameras that are made to withstand everything from thunderstorms to extreme temperatures. Plus, they connect to an app, which allows you to check on your home at any time.\n\nIf you're following a protein-rich diet, the Premiere Protein frozen pancakes are a great way to reach your goals.\n\nEach box comes with 36 pancakes that are convenient and ready to eat after less than two minutes in the microwave.

The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure.

    "title": "The US government says you should be proteinmaxxing. Experts say that can backfire — here's why.",
    "description": "The U.S. government is proteinmaxxing with new dietary guidelines recommending more meat and fewer whole grains. Dietitians and doctors disagree.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. government today announced that it's ending the \"war on protein.\"\n\nIf there's a war on, protein seems to already be winning it. The nutrient has dominated grocery lists, store aisles, and social media feeds for the past year.\n\nThe protein obsession is big business, driving products like protein pancakes, protein popcorn, protein lattes, and more. Last fall, Starbucks debuted a $2 \"protein foam\" that you can add to any cold drink.\n\nNow it's the first word in the new dietary guidelines, straight from Robert F. Kennedy Jr's \"Make America Healthy Again\" playbook, with an emphasis on meaty meals like steak and chicken.\n\nBut doctors and dietitians have been warning that protein is beginning to eclipse other crucial nutrients on Americans' plates. And, far from helping us cut back on ultra-processed foods, the protein craze has been a boon for food manufacturing, as protein has been added to health-ify chips, candy, pastries, and cereal.\n\nHere's what to know about the latest recommendations, how to figure out the right amount of protein for you, and the best ways to get it.\n\nThere's no question that protein is an essential nutrient, helping to support healthy muscles and bones, regulate metabolism, and manage appetite.\n\nIt's also true that it can be challenging for some people to get enough protein.\n\nFor decades, women were urged to diet on protein-poor fad foods like cabbage soup and plain grapefruits, mistakenly thinking a hearty meal or heavy weight would make us bulky. Now, in part thanks to the rise of strength training, our appetites have come back with a vengeance, and protein is a major part of the menu.\n\nThe recent boom of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss has also brought protein to the forefront, as Americans have pushed to hold on to muscle mass while losing fat.\n\nProtein is also a crucial nutrient for longevity. As we get older, our muscle mass tends to naturally decline, which, if we're not careful, can lead to frailty and an increased risk of injury and illness. Eating enough protein as we age helps maintain muscle for more resilience and strength at age 60 and beyond.\n\nPrevious dietary guidelines focused on the bare minimum of protein you'd need to avoid malnutrition, which is around 0.36 grams per pound of body weight (about 54 grams per day for a 150-pound person).\n\nHowever, avoiding starvation is rarely the only goal of eating. Nutrition and exercise science suggest the optimal amount of protein for building muscle is about twice that amount, about 0.7 grams per pound daily (105 grams for a 150-pound person). In a day, that translates to about 30 to 35 grams per meal.\n\nToday, some top TikTokers log themselves eating more than 100 grams of protein at a single meal, and 300 or more grams in a day. Great, if you're the Rock.\n\nFor the rest of us, there's no reason to spend that extra time, money, and energy on all that protein, said Dr. Federica Amati, medical scientist and head nutritionist at the nutrition app ZOE.\n\n\"Definitely, I think it's overrated,\" she previously told Business Insider. \"The interest in protein isn't going anywhere because it's been ingrained, especially in the US culture.\"\n\nProtein has been a mainstay of American nutrition for well over four decades: from the Atkins era in the 70s, peaking in the early aughts, to current keto, low-carb, and carnivore diets. Along the way, food fads alternatively demonized dietary fats and carbs. For any health-conscious person, what else was left to eat but more and more protein?\n\nThe problem, according to Amati and others, is that protein is hogging the spotlight from other key nutrients that play a major role in our health.\n\n\"If you just focus on telling people you need to eat one gram of protein for a kilogram of body weight, then you don't know what else is going on the plate,\" Amati said.\n\nFiber, for instance, plays a crucial role in gut health, metabolism, and longevity. And you're far more likely to be missing out on fiber than protein, Amati said. Incidentally, the latest dietary guidelines put key sources of fiber, like beans and whole grains, near the bottom of the pyramid.\n\nEven for athletes, who need extra protein to recover from the strain of exercise, can get too much protein, cardiologist Dr. Dmitry Yaranov previously told Business Insider. Bodybuilders, for instance, look like the pinnacle of health, but \"end up with weak hearts and blocked arteries,\" he said.\n\nThe latest dietary guidelines recommend between 0.6 and 0.9 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily, between 90 and 135 grams for a 150-pound person.\n\nHowever, Amati said you don't need to track your grams of protein at all. If you simply must count your protein on a daily basis, she recommends calculating a percentage instead of the number of grams.\n\nIf you're eating around 2000 calories a day, 100 grams of protein would translate to about 20% of your diet, leaving the other 80% of your diet for more crucial nutrients.\n\n\"What the percentage helps us do is focus on the importance of a varied diet,\" she said.\n\nMeat makes up a large part of Kennedy's new vision of healthy eating in America (including our right to fries soaked in cattle fat), part of the comeback movement for dairy, butter, and other animal-based foods.\n\nBut red and processed meats (including trendy jerky snacks and deli meats) have consistently been linked to a higher risk of heart disease and some cancers.\n\nAmati said your best bet is focusing on variety in your diet. If you're eating a range of foods — including plant-based protein sources like beans, nuts, and seeds — you'll get all the essential amino acids you need, along with plenty of fiber, vitamins, and minerals.",

    "fullText": "Reid Hoffman isn't a fan of California's proposed wealth tax, and he said he let Rep. Mo Khanna know about it during a recent conversation.\n\nIn a post on X, the LinkedIn cofounder — and prominent Democratic donor — said Rep. Mo Khanna had reached out to discuss the proposed tax, which would impose a 5% tax on billionaires in the state of California. Hoffman called the proposal \"badly designed\" with \"massive flaws\" that would be \"horrendous\" for innovation.\n\n\"The proposed CA wealth tax is badly designed in so many ways that a simple social post cannot cover all of the massive flaws,\" Hoffman wrote. \"One well-documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal. Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.\"\n\nHe said that, after the conversation, he believes Khanna sees Silicon Valley as \"a massively important creation of the future,\" adding that the congressman wants to \"preserve and evolve capitalism\" through the proposed tax.\n\n\"It is true that we need to preserve and grow the incredible creation and generativity of Silicon Valley,\" Hoffman wrote. \"It is also true that we must figure out how to help people who have not benefited from the wealth, jobs, and company creation engine of Silicon Valley thus far.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Khanna wrote that he appreciated \"the excellent dialogue\" with Hoffman.\n\n\"You summarized my goal and aspiration correctly!\" Khanna said.\n\nSilicon Valley superstars have been split on the proposed wealth tax. Some prominent figures in tech, like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, have come out in support of the proposal, while others have sharply criticized it.\n\nGoogle's Larry Page moved several of his assets and his businesses out of the state ahead of an end-of-2025 deadline that would have risked exposing him to the proposed tax, Business Insider exclusively reported on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump singled out Raytheon on Wednesday in his sweeping criticism of the defense industry, threatening to cut the company's government contracts if it didn't invest \n\nTrump called out Raytheon by name after earlier saying he wouldn't allow defense firms to do buybacks or pay dividends until they speed up production. The president said Raytheon has been \"the least responsive\" to the government's needs, slow in increasing volume, and has prioritized returning capital to shareholders over the military's priorities.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government, Trump said in a Truth Social post.\n\nA spokesperson for RTX Corporation, formerly known as Raytheon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The company rebranded as RTX in 2023 following a merger with United Technologies Corporation.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump fired a broadside at the entire defense industry, posting on Truth Social that he would \"not permit\" further stock buybacks or dividends to be issued to shareholders. Trump also said that until defense companies build \"NEW and MODERN Production Plants\" their executives' pay should be capped at $5 million.\n\nLike its competitors, shares of RTX dropped after Trump's initial post about the industry. RTX rebounded in early after-hours trading, trending up more than 3% as of 6 p.m. ET.\n\nIt's unclear why Trump singled out Raytheon in particular. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders. Raytheon announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023 and says it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.\n\nLast year, the company paid out a dividend in March. It's unclear if Trump's statement will affect those plans or even the extent to which a president could prohibit a publicly traded company from fulfilling its previously declared financial obligations.\n\nTrump has frequently used the presidential bully pulpit to criticize companies and their CEOs. In August 2025, Trump called for Intel to fire its CEO Lip-Bu Tan, only to later change his stance after the US government acquired a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker.\n\nIt is less common for Trump to directly threaten a company's government contracts, although he has done so as well.\n\nIn July 2025, Trump threatened to cut off Elon Musk's companies from government contracts during a heated back-and-forth with the world's richest person. Since then, Trump has reconciled with the billionaire.",

    "title": "This Radar-Equipped Stove Shutoff Is One of the Most Practical Things I Saw at CES",
    "description": "The iGuard keeps seniors safe in the kitchen by reducing the chance of cooking fires.",
    "fullText": "Radar-based sensors seem to be having a moment at CES, especially in tech meant for people to keep tabs on their aging family members. One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove.\n\niGuard is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.\n\nA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on.\n\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.\n\nThe device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.\n\nA previous version, called the iGuardStove, used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.\n\nI’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuard has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended.\n\nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuard can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuard has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running.\n\nThe device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.\n\nWhile a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuard seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.\n\nUpdate 1/7/2025 at 7:48 a.m. PST: Corrected to note that the new product is named iGuard, and the previous version with motion sensors was iGuardStove.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "title": "15 Shows Like 'Stranger Things' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "These streaming shows will turn you Upside Down.",
    "fullText": "After a decade, Stranger Things is at an end. Well, I mean, except for planned animated and live-action spin-offs...and possibly an unlikely secret extra episode related to the 'Conformity Gate' theory; adherents are convinced that the whole thing we watched was just Vecna messing with our Hawkins crew. But the story that started way back in 2016 is mostly over, almost for sure! Given the pace of life these days, the end of the Obama administration feels, somehow, as distant as the series' nostalgic 1980s setting. The show solidified Netflix as the streamer to beat in terms of original programming, and introduced a new generation of child stars who are all now firmly adults. The show's blend of nostalgia, horror, and small-town weirdness has been wildly influential (and endlessly copied), but its success is based, also, on its synthesis and deft reworking of deeply familiar elements. In that spirit, here are a few shows of the past and present that, in various ways, carry some of those Stranger vibes.\n\nTravel to The Town (we never get a name for it), a palce from which no one can ever leave. The residents and visitors aren't metaphorically trapped, but literally so, as in the later seasons of Stranger Things, as they are beset by creatures come from the woods that kill anyone found outside after dark. The Matthews family learn all about this firsthand when they roll into the place in their RV and soon find themselves trapped alongside the local sheriff (Harold Perrineau) just as it's getting dark. The monsters here aren't just mindlessly hungry, they're cunning and sadistic, and more than capable of killing residents in gory ways. It's a supernatural spin on the \"small towns ain't what they seem\" vibe. Stream From on MGM+.\n\nSophia Lillis, straight from playing Beverly Marsh in the It movies, stars as Sydney Novak, a 17-year-old living in a small town with her mother and sister. Her father recently died by suicide; she has a crush on her best friend; and all she and her mother do is argue. In the middle of all of that, she discovers that she had powers triggered by her emotions, both of which she'll need to learn to control if she wants to get her life in order. As the lead, Lillis sells the hell out of this offbeat coming-of-age story which was canceled after one season. Because of course it was. Stream I Am Not Okay With This on Netflix.\n\nComplete tonal mismatch here aside, there are few stranger shows streaming right now than this weird sci-fi apocalypse from Breaking Bad's Vince Gilligan. Rhea Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, a fantasy romance author and general grouch who becomes one of only 13 people on the planet immune to the \"Joining\"—the result of an alien virus that transforms the rest of humanity into a peaceful, perky, and perpetually content hive mind. Carol refuses to surrender her miserableness in the face of a loss of identity, fighting instead to restore humanity to its admittedly cruddy ways. Thrilling, heartbreaking, and oddly funny, the show manages to address some big questions about what it means to be human, and what we'd be willing to give up to change. Stream Pluribus on Apple TV+.\n\nThere are few (if any) teens here, but Haven (based on the Stephen King short story \"The Colorado Kid\") has got the \"weird stuff goes down in a small town\" vibe down pat. Emily Rose stars as Audrey Parker, an FBI Special Agent sent to the title town of Haven, Maine on a routine case. Soon, she gets drawn into “the Troubles,\" a series of harmful supernatural events that have recurred throughout the town’s history—and, by no coincidence, are happening again. A supernatural-case-of-the-week format gives way to a bigger mystery when Audrey comes to learn that this isn’t her first time in Haven, nor the first time she’s encountered the Troubles. Lucas Bryant and Eric Balfour co-star. Stream Haven on Peacock and Prime Video.\n\nDark began as a mystery involving a missing child and evolved, over its three seasons, into a wildly complex narrative: a time travel-driven story that explores dark family secrets over the course of several generations. The German import has a striking look and incredibly atmospheric feel, with an ensemble cast of teens and adults whose narratives are deftly intertwined. Especially given the title, you'd be absolutely right to assume that the tone here is quite a bit more dark than that of Stranger Things, but the shows have plenty in common, including an interest in the '80s. Stream Dark on Netflix.\n\nNot a series, precisely, but a series of movies that play out like a miniseries (at least initially), and that play in the retro-nostalgia horror-vibe that Stranger Things does so well. Adapted from the R. L. Stine books, Fear Street Part One: 1994 kicks off the series by introducing the town of Shadyside, which the local kids call “Shittyside,” and has a dark history of multiple murders, most of them covered up. A group of teens upsets the grave of a witch, kicking off the revival of a murderous cult. There are some legit gore and scares (it’s YA, more or less, but definitely not kids’ stuff) as Janiak pays homage to a wide range of horror movies past. The series continues with an impeccable camp slasher homage in Fear Street Part Two: 1978, and then an origin tale that brings the initial trilogy to a conclusion in Fear Street Part Three: 1666. There's a standalone fourth film, as well, and more on the way, but you're fine sticking with the initial trilogy. Stream Fear Street Part One: 1994 on Netflix.\n\nThis would be the easiest possible recommendation for Stranger Things fans, were it not for the fact that the well-reviewed show was cancelled after one season (though it still ends with a fairly satisfying wrap up). Based on the pretty great comic book series from Brian K. Vaughan and Cliff Chiang, the show follows four young friends—Erin, Tiff, Mac, and KJ—on their paper route the morning after Halloween in 1988. After the skies turn pink and they're accosted by competing groups of weirdos, they head for the safety of Erin's house, only to discover they're suddenly in 2019. Made into targets by their inadvertent time travel, the girls have to stay alive while also deciding whether they want to take the chance to change their own timelines. Stream Paper Girls on Prime Video.\n\nA gorgeous-looking anthology (sort of), Tales From the Loop takes place in the small town of Mercer, Ohio—a town that happens to sit upon the titular Loop, a physics lab exploring mysteries for which science has no answers. Each episode offers the story of a person or family in the town impacted by the work of the Loop, in slow-burning stories about the intersection of technology and human existence. It’s based on a conceptual art book by artist Simon Stålenhag, and successfully ports over that book’s striking look and feel. It's far quieter and more meditative than something like Stranger Things, but worth your time if that's your mood. Stream Tales from the Loop on Prime Video.\n\nThe least buzzy of Mike Flanagan's Netflix offerings is every bit as good as Midnight Mass, The Fall of the House of Usher, et al. Based on the YA novel by Christopher Pike, it follows a group of eight terminally ill young patients at a bucolic hospice home run by a secretive and mysterious doctor (A Nightmare on Elm Street's Heather Langenkamp). Each night the kids meet secretly to share scary stories, with each also promising to return from beyond the grave when the time comes. Spooky and surprisingly moving, the show was planned as more than a miniseries, and the cancellation left some questions unanswered, but the ending is still pretty satisfying. Stream The Midnight Club on Netflix.\n\nTeens and adults in a deceptively quiet small town (in the '80s, no less) face tragedy accompanied by supernatural threats from outside of our normal space and time. That's a reasonably fair synopsis of both Stranger Things and Twin Peaks, but it also serves to obscure the massive tonal differences between the two shows. Kyle MacLachlan plays FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, who arrives in the title town to investigate the murder of teenager homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). His arrival in town precipitates a (very) long night of the soul as Cooper uncovers secrets and mysteries among the town's delightfully, and often disturbingly, weird residents. Stream Twin Peaks on Paramount+ or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThe Upside Down of Stranger Things is a dark, challenging, chaotic mirror to our own reality—so imagine a similarly sinister parallel space, now with a bit more obvious structure. Video-game obsessed Arisu gets his wish, after a fashion, when he finds himself, along with a couple of friends, transported to an alternate, eerily abandoned version of Tokyo—the title’s Borderland—vividly brought to life via some clever green screen work. The three are directed to an arena and given the instructions for the game, which they’ll be playing whether they want to or not. The first competition involves a locked-room-style puzzle; if they fail, the room goes up in flames with them in it—think Ready Player One, with deadlier stakes. There are games each night, though the rules allow for winners to get time off. There are a lot of rules, actually, but the games are cleverly and sadistically constructed. Stream Alice in Borderland on Netflix.\n\nPeyton List stars as Maddie, a teenager in small-town Wisconsin for whom her death is very much just the beginning. Stuck in a high school in the afterlife (because hell is definitely for children), she goes on a journey to solve her own murder while uncovering secrets and lies in both worlds. It all sounds a bit grim, but the show has a sense of fun about it: While Maddie does develop the ability to communicate with the living, her world is populated by ghost teens from various eras and generations, with customs, mores, and cliques having developed in ghost high school just as in our world. Stream School Spirits on Paramount+ or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nTaking a turn off of Fear Street, we return to R.L. Stine—who is, after all, our reigning master of YA horror (his name appearing on well over 300 books). In contrast with earlier adaptations, this series ditches the episodic anthology format of the 1990s series in favor of a more anthologized teen drama, probably in direct response to the popularity of Stranger Things. The first season is set in the present (while involving a mystery from the past), so skips the nostalgic charms (and traps) of the Netflix series, finding a modern group of teens in a weird town encountering the various monsters and scares (many of them legitimately freaky). Each season shifts the focus to a new story, with a new cast of actors in their mid-20s playing teens. Stream Goosebumps on Disney+.\n\nThis time-jumping survival drama is about a group of teenage girls becoming stranded in the wilderness in 1996 and doing terrible things to survive—the extent of which we only learn about via flashbacks from the present, where the events of those 19 months continue to have an impact. There are teases of the supernatural here, much of it ambiguous, but there's plenty of horror in a past that we're still seeing fleshed (ahem) out. Where Stranger Things revels in its '80s setting, Yellowjackets more cynically posits that there's a huge difference between the version of the past we talk about and the one that really happened. Stream Yellowjackets on Paramount+ (the first two seasons are also on Netflix) or you can buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThe much-loved, if relatively short-lived, animated series follows twin siblings Mabel and Dipper Pines (Kristen Schaal and Jason Ritter) sent to spend the summer with their great-uncle (aka \"Grunkle\") Stan (voiced by show creator Alex Hirsch). While helping Stan run his mystery-themed tourist shack, the kids run into a series of supernatural mysteries, many related to the show's ultimate antagonist, dream demon Bill Cipher. Like Stranger Things, the series came to a planned conclusion (albeit after four years rather than ten), and it's finale was similarly a ratings blockbuster—the highest rated telecast in the history of Disney XD, as a matter of fact.

    "title": "Four Ways to Keep Your House Warm When the Heat Goes Out",
    "description": "It’s freezing outside and your power just went out—along with your furnace or boiler.",
    "fullText": "Living in a comfortable, heated house is something a lot of us take for granted. When the cold weather hits, we just put on thick socks, turn up the thermostat (or take other steps), and go about our business. But most modern homes rely on the electrical grid to keep that heat flowing. Even if your home is heated by natural gas or heating oil, there’s most likely an electric component to your heating system.\n\nThat means that when the power goes out—say, in the middle of a fierce blizzard—so does your heat. Even recently built homes can lose interior heat pretty quickly, dropping to uncomfortable (and even unsafe) temperatures within a day at most. If you’re not sure when power will be restored, you’ll need to find a way to keep the place as warm as possible if you and your property are going to come out of the experience unscathed. Here are are four ways to keep your house warm if your heat goes out.\n\nIf you have some warning that a power loss is possible during the cold months—a winter storm warning, for example—it’s a good idea to “pre-heat” your home. The warmer your house is when the power goes out, the longer it will remain at a safe and/or comfortable temperature. You don’t necessarily want to make it tropical, but a few degrees higher than usual will buy you some time if the power goes out. Combined with sealing the house as tightly as possible—by hanging thermal curtains or blankets over windows, applying plastic insulation kits to windows, and deploying draft stoppers under doorways and anywhere else cold air is getting in—this strategy can be very effective.\n\nTrying to keep a large house warm without an active heating system is a fool’s errand. Instead, focus on a single room where everyone in the house can gather, because a small room is a lot easier to warm up. A few considerations about which room to choose:\n\nSince heat rises, rooms on upper floors will be warmer than rooms on the main floor.\n\nA room that gets a lot of sunlight can be warmed during the day by opening up the curtains and letting that solar energy do its thing.\n\nSmaller rooms will be easier to heat up, but consider how many people will need to live and sleep in there.\n\nRooms near bathrooms (or with en-suite baths) offer a bit more convenience, especially if you’re going to be hunkering down for a while.\n\nOnce you’ve selected the room you’ll be using, try to keep it closed up as much as possible (covering windows, stopping up drafts, keeping the door closed). Introducing an indoor-safe heater is a good idea if you have one (or you can make one; see below).\n\nIf none of the rooms in your house are ideal, you could also consider setting up a tent indoors. Tents are designed to hold in heat, and can create a small, controllable environment that will be easier to keep warm in a pinch.\n\nIf you’ve planned ahead and have an indoor-safe propane or kerosene heater (or even a solar-powered portable heater), that will obviously help to keep your home warm (just be certain to follow all the instructions for ventilating whatever space you’re heating up). If you haven’t, or you discover that your propane tanks have leaked and you have no fuel, don’t despair. You can still generate heat by building a candle-pot heater, which is an old-school way of generating some quick heat.\n\nA candle-pot heater is pretty easy to set up: You’ll need 1-3 clay flower pots (or similar ceramic containers) in different sizes, some non-flammable materials to set up on (bricks or stone tiles will work), and some candles. Then arrange everything:\n\nSet up your bricks or other materials to create a raised platform, with plenty of airflow.\n\nPlace your smallest pot upside down on the bricks and cover the hole in the bottom (if it’s a flowerpot).\n\nPlace the larger pot on top, and then the largest on top of that if you have three pots.\n\nPlace your candles underneath and light them.\n\nThe candles don’t produce much heat, but the clay pots will absorb that heat and slowly start to radiate out. Instead of the candles’ heat just rising up to your ceiling and being cooled by the frigid air already in the room, the pots capture it and intensify it.\n\nWill this replace your home’s heating system, or even a portable propane heater? Not by a mile. But it will make a difference, especially in a small space.\n\nA few things to keep in mind here:\n\nCandles are open flames, so never leave your heater unattended, and always be conscious of fire hazards.\n\nYou can place a foil-covered panel behind the heater to help reflect the heat in a specific direction (say, toward the chair you’re sitting in).\n\nIf you have a gas furnace, it’s not that hard to keep it running even during a blackout if you have an alternative power source like a generator or even a power bank. The furnace needs electricity to run the ignition, the blower, and communication between the thermostat and the furnace or boiler. A decent generator or robust battery can definitely keep your furnace running for a while—and those extra hours or days could be crucial in an extended cold-weather blackout.\n\nIf you can see an obvious on/off switch on your furnace, you can pretty easily install a transfer switch like this one (here’s a video demonstrating how it’s done). This allows you to plug in a generator or power bank and keep your furnace running even when the power’s out—all you have to do is plug it in and flip the switch. If you’re not entirely comfortable with electrical wiring, you can hire a licensed electrician to install it as well, of course. Once it’s done, you’ll never have to worry about a cold house again—as long as you pair the switch with a generator or battery solution of sufficient power to keep things running.",

    "description": "Standard wheelchairs are less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that.",
    "fullText": "Wheelchairs are available at airports, hotels, resorts, theme parks, and on cruises, but standard wheelchairs require ongoing effort and can struggle through difficult terrain. Standard wheelchairs are simply less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that.\n\nWheelMove is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are. It debuted at CES 2026, marking a significant leap in accessibility for wheelchair users who travel.\n\nWhen I found WheelMove at CES \"Unveiled,\" I thought back to a recent family trip just two weeks ago, where two of my older family members often rented wheelchairs. They don't use wheelchairs in their day-to-day lives, but walking through a theme park all day wasn't possible. They needed support navigating the park, and the rest of us gladly took shifts pushing their wheelchairs. With a portable attachment like WheelMove, though, wheelchair users can use less effort and enjoy more independence through the battery-powered, remote-controlled attachment.\n\nRiders simply attach WheelMove to the front of any standard wheelchair, and the device lifts the wheelchair's smaller front wheels off the ground. Once attached, the rider controls the WheelMove through a basic remote control on their armrest, thigh, or wherever is most comfortable. The attachment weighs under 20 pounds, including its 10-inch wheel, 250W motor, and a battery that goes about 15 miles on a charge. Carrying an additional battery can double its range before needing to recharge, and it can navigate terrains including gravel, grass, and uneven surfaces like cobblestone.\n\nWheelMove is an incredibly innovative assistive technology poised to broaden personal mobility for those who need it, and it's also one of the finalists for the official Best of CES 2026 awards for the travel category. Pre-orders are available in France where the start-up is based, but the founders plan to expand internationally later this year. It costs about €5,000 or $6,000.",

    "description": "Tired of all the Microsoft AI slop? You can remove it entirely.",
    "fullText": "Some people love AI. If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.\n\nIf you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out \nRemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).\n\nTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\n\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n\nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.",

    "fullText": "There are likely occasions in your day-to-day life in which you allow someone else to use your phone, whether it's letting your kid play a game or sharing content with a friend. You may do this without thinking about the privacy implications and what might happen if another person has access to everything on your device and—accidentally or on purpose—uses it to view your search history, scroll through your photos, or send messages to your contacts.\n\nIf you're an Android user, you should enable app pinning to keep others from snooping around your device. This feature keeps the user in the pinned app until you enter your PIN, pattern, or password. (On iOS, you can achieve a similar effect with Guided Access, which also allows you to set time limits and disable the keyboard and touch input.)\n\nTo pin apps, you'll need to enable the feature in your phone's Settings app. To do so, go to Security or Security & location > Advanced > App pinning and toggle on Use app pinning and Ask for PIN before unpinning.\n\nBefore handing your phone over, open to the app screen you want to pin, then swipe up to the middle of the screen and hold to open your Overview. Tap the app's icon, then tap Pin. This will keep the user locked into that app until you unpin (using your PIN, pattern, or password).\n\nDepending on your device navigation settings, there are a few ways to unpin an app:\n\nGesture navigation: Swipe up and hold\n\n2-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + Home\n\n3-button navigation: Touch and hold Back + Overview\n\nNote that pinning won't prevent someone from using the app fully, such as swiping through your photos or typing in the search bar, as Android doesn't have the option to disable touch. Pinned apps can also open other apps. At the very least, though, it keeps someone from having access to anything and everything on your device.",

    "fullText": "I write a lot about productivity, which means I also read a lot about it. Over the last few months, I've noticed an uptick in people discussing something called \"cognitive overload,\" citing it as a potential reason for a decline in output. The phrase stuck out to me as one of those buzzy terms that has the potential to be overused until it's meaningless—but at its core, it certainly has a real, clear definition that can be helpful tool in maximizing productivity.\n\nBasically, cognitive overload is what happens when you're inundated with more information than your brain can process, so your brain just gives up altogether, making hard to focus on anything at all. Here's what to know about it and what to do once you identify it.\n\nYou know all those jokes on social media about how a single news item or food product from modern times would kill a person born just a few centuries ago? They're funny and hyperbolic, but they're grounded in the fact that while the ways in which we produce things and share information have advanced wildly, the human brain has basically remained the same. We say it all the time but it bears repeating: We're just not cut out to handle the onslaught of stimuli we get on a daily basis.\n\nThink of how many times your phone lights up on a given day. I just checked my screentime app and discovered that though it's only early afternoon, I've gotten 150 notifications straight to my lock screen already today. It's only Wednesday, so I'm averaging 213 a day, which my phone assures me is down 20% from last week and I'm quite sure I'll pick back up by the time Sunday rolls around. Considering that a few months ago, I redid all my phone settings so not all of my notifications got blasted to my lock screen, this is concerning. That's just a lot of information to constantly see.\n\nAs it turns out, text-based info is the main cause of cognitive overload, at least according to one study. Emails, Slack and Teams messages, texts, calendar notifications—the never-ending stream of these bad boys is a major contributor to the overall feeling of being unable to process or do anything. If you think about an average day when you've felt too zapped to work, it probably included plenty of those. Audio-visual stimuli are less debilitating, according to the study, so a Zoom or phone call or a manager stopping by your desk may not trip you up as badly.\n\nBeyond feeling like you can't even think straight or like you're too overwhelmed to take action on any one task, you may be able to recognize cognitive overload from other signs. If incoming messages make you feel frustrated or detached, for instance, no matter what they say, this could be happening to you. That's actually the symptom I experience most often, for what it's worth. When I'm overwhelmed by too much information, I find myself thinking, \"What do you want?!\" every time my phone lights up, before I even see who is reaching out. (Sorry, Mom.)\n\nAs I was going through the study and thinking over cognitive overload, I realized I've already been implementing a few tricks that may have been helping me avoid it. As mentioned above, I banned my least-used apps from sending me notifications a few months ago. For years, I've also tinkered with my MacBook settings so I don't get any form of push notification on my computer. My phone is next to me at all times; there's no good reason for the top right corner of my laptop screen to be whacking me with the same notifications the phone is already showing me.\n\nA few other tried-and-true productivity approaches came to mind for me once I got a good grasp of what cognitive overload actually is. The one-touch rule of inbox management could be useful for you if you find that messages get you worked up. With that, you open each message as you get it and make an instant decision about what to do with the contents. It might seem counterintuitive to face each incoming message head-on if you're trying to avoid feeling burned out by the sheer volume of them, but I've found that when I see a message preview at the top of my screen and do nothing about it, it nags at me all day. Addressing it instantly helps me clear my mind and keep working.\n\nOtherwise, the way you go about battling this is going to be pretty subjective, although I do have one more recommendation: If you're not familiar with the Pomodoro technique, get familiar now. With it, you work for a set amount of time (usually 25 minutes) before taking a small break (usually five). When you're in those focus sessions, you should be completely distraction-free, putting your devices in Do Not Disturb mode or even using specialized apps to block other, distracting apps. Knowing you have to work seriously for a certain amount of time can help get you in the zone and push you away from information and decision paralysis while knowing you eventually get a break can help you stay relaxed as you go.",

    "fullText": "Football can often deliver fairytale moments - and at the Vitality Stadium on Wednesday it served one up as Antoine Semenyo brought the curtain down on his Bournemouth career in perfect fashion.\n\nThe forward, who is on the verge of joining Manchester City, provided yet another telling contribution for the Cherries when he struck in the final few minutes against Tottenham to end his side's 11-match run without a Premier League win.\n\nIt was his 10th goal of the season and arguably one of his most memorable - certainly in terms of the context of the match and how dramatic the strike was, and to complete the magical moment it also came on his 26th birthday.\n\nIt also meant he could get the dream send-off as Semenyo was substituted with seconds left, allowing him to soak up the adulation from the home supporters as well as applaud them back.\n\n\"If that is to be his last involvement for Bournemouth there is no better way for it to go,\" Semenyo's Bournemouth team-mate Marcus Tavernier told Sky Sports.\n\n\"That was the type of stuff you write in movies and no man deserves it more than him.\"\n\nBournemouth manager Andoni Iraola effectively confirmed Semenyo's departure after the game, but praised his commitment and attitude right up until his final moment in a Cherries shirt.\n\n\"That was lovely for Antoine,\" he said. \"Sometimes football gives you these things.\n\n\"He has been top - he has given everything and been committed until the end. I think it is good football gives him back this moment.\"",

    "fullText": "Harlequins coach Jason Gilmore has warned his under-performing squad they are playing for their futures, with the club planning to streamline their squad.\n\nQuins have had a wretched season so far, with head coach Danny Wilson's September departure followed by only four wins from 15 matches in all competitions.\n\nA club statement, signed off by Harlequins' chief executive and chairman in the wake of last weekend's 66-21 defeat by Northampton, said recent results were \"not considered acceptable by anyone within the club\".\n\nQuins host South African side Stormers - who, by contrast, have won all 10 of their matches this season - in the Champions Cup on Sunday.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is, we do have a lot of players on contract,\" said Gilmore.\n\n\"We're looking at the spend that we put into the squad to make sure that we're getting most bang for our buck. And the boys are aware of that.\n\n\"What is the ideal number of contracts? Where do we put our spend into and what do we actually need?\"\n\nHarlequins saw off competition from Sale to retain England back-five forward Chandler Cunningham-South on a new contract in November, while Northampton full-back George Furbank is expected to move to the Twickenham Stoop for the start of next season.\n\nBristol second row James Dun has also been confirmed as a new arrival for 2026-27.\n\nFormer captain Stephen Lewies has been linked with a return to his native South Africa, external when his present deal expires at the end of the season, but Gilmore suggested other departures may be necessary as he looks for a smaller squad, combining quality and flexibility.\n\n\"You obviously need the right amount of contracts across all positions so that if you do get injuries, it's not like you're scrambling,\" he added.\n\n\"But what we're looking at is, can we be more efficient with our contracting?\"\n\nHarlequins have lost a host of big-name players in recent seasons, with the retirement of Joe Marler, Danny Care and Matt Symons coinciding with the departures of Andre Esterhuizen, Will Collier, Wilco Louw and Joe Marchant.\n\nGilmore said he was focused on reviving Harlequins' trademark attacking style, while emphasising the need for physicality in defence.\n\n\"How much are we prepared to fight?\" he added.\n\n\"It's just not about being on the back foot, it's about arresting momentum in the game and making sure that we keep on top.\"\n\nFlanker Jack Kenningham came through the club's academy, having been a regular at the Stoop as a boy.\n\n\"I put my body on the line every time I play for Quins - I love the club,\" said the 26-year-old.\n\n\"It means a lot to me, having been a season-ticket holder when I was about 11 years old. So it hurts me probably, potentially more than others when we do lose.\"",

With draws against Sunderland, Chelsea and now Brighton, they have so far not been up to the test.\n\nIf Arsenal beat Liverpool on Thursday, City will be eight points off the top with 17 games to play.\n\n\"The result is the result,\" said Guardiola. \"One point for them, one point for us. It is what it is.\n\n\"The second half was quite similar against Sunderland and Chelsea - we missed the passes.

Netflix also published the logline for The Witcher Season 5.\n\"The time of the end is nigh: Dark forces are aligning all across the Continent with villainous designs on Ciri.",

Oh, and Wonkeeland on the BR map will become Cartmanland.\nUsing a short film to reveal the collab is something that Fortnite recently also did for its Simpsons-themed season in November--a Fortnite collaboration being something else that The Simpsons did before Butters could.

    "description": "The program allows patients in the state to get prescription refills for 190 common meds.",
    "fullText": "The state of Utah is allowing artificial intelligence to prescribe medication refills to patients without direct human oversight in a pilot program public advocates call “dangerous.”\n\nThe program is through the state’s “regulatory sandbox” framework, which allows businesses to trial “innovative” products or services with state regulations temporarily waived. The Utah Department of Commerce partnered with Doctronic, a telehealth startup with an AI chatbot.\n\nDoctronic offers a nationwide service that allows patients to chat with its “AI doctor” for free, then, for $39, book a virtual appointment with a real doctor licensed in their state. But patients must go through the AI chatbot first to get an appointment.\n\nAccording to a non-peer-reviewed preprint article from Doctronic, which looked at 500 telehealth cases in its service, the company claims its AI’s diagnosis matched the diagnosis made by a real clinician in 81 percent of cases. The AI’s treatment plan was “consistent” with that of a doctor’s in 99 percent of the cases.\n\nNow, for patients in Utah, Doctronic’s chatbot can refill a prescription without a doctor, for a $4 service fee . After a patient signs in and verifies state residency, the AI chatbot can pull up the patient’s prescription history and offer a list of prescription medications eligible for a refill. According to Politico, the chatbot will only be able to renew prescriptions for 190 common medications for chronic conditions, with key exclusions, such as medications for pain and ADHD, and those that are injected.\n\nThe first 250 renewals for each drug class will be reviewed by real doctors, but after that, the AI chatbot will be on its own. Adam Oskowitz, Doctronic co-founder and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, told Politico that the AI chatbot is designed to err on the side of safety and escalate any case with uncertainty to a real doctor.\n\n“Utah’s approach to regulatory mitigation strikes a vital balance between fostering innovation and ensuring consumer safety,” Margaret Woolley Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nFor now, it’s unclear if the Food and Drug Administration will step in to regulate AI prescribing. On the one hand, prescription renewals are a matter of practicing medicine, which falls under state governance. However, Politico notes that the FDA has said that it has the authority to regulate medical devices used to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.\n\nIn a statement, Robert Steinbrook, health research group director at watchdog Public Citizen, blasted Doctronic’s program and the lack of oversight. “AI should not be autonomously refilling prescriptions, nor identifying itself as an ‘AI doctor,'” Steinbrook said.\n\n“Although the thoughtful application of AI can help to improve aspects of medical care, the Utah pilot program is a dangerous first step toward more autonomous medical practice,” he said.\"The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies cannot look the other way when AI applications undermine the essential human clinician role in prescribing and renewing medications.”",

Make sure to check out all the details for Season 1 Reloaded in Black Ops 7 and Warzone, including more weapons, multiplayer maps, and new Zombies content.\n\nBelow, we highlight all the new Fallout-themed game modes players can enjoy. This includes modes for multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and even the campaign's Endgame.\n\nIn the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Mayhem playlist, Black Ops 7's multiplayer maps are irradiated with toxic particles. These are 6v6 matches of Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint, and they feature \"S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs\" to help players keep their radiation at safe levels. The HUD features a Geiger counter to display exposure levels, and players will want to collect the buffs to avoid taking too much radiation damage.\n\nThe S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs include:\n\nThe Ghouls is a spin on Call of Duty's Infected mode. In this mode, players spawn into the match as Vault Dwellers on irritated multiplayer maps. They must scavenge for perks and RadAway to help them survive, and each eliminated Vault Dweller returns to the match as a ghoul fighting against the dwellers. Players must survive as Vault Dweller or infect everyone as a ghoul to win.\n\nThe Feral Ghouls and Deathclaws of Fallout invade both the Ashes of the Damned and Astra Malorum maps in this themed limited-time mode. In Project RADs, players are also exposed to increased levels of radiation with each passing round.\n\nThis changes the mode's usual means of healing and earning Essence. Instead, these are replaced with a system of drops given by fallen enemies that assist the crew in keeping rad levels at bay and gaining vital resources.\n\nWhile it's not exactly an LTM, players can hunt down Fallout's infamous Deathclaws in Endgame. Deathclaws can be found in matches as a limited-time world event. For this event, a bomb blast reduces a portion of Avalon into a Fallout-inspired wasteland with toxic air. Players can fight through hordes of feral ghouls to take on a Deathclaw hunt for rewards.\n\nPower Armor Royale is a Fallout-themed spin on battle royale. This features 66 players in trios on Verdansk, where power armor can be obtained from air drops. Players will need to charge up Fusion Cores in order to use any power armor, but the suit will grant the user a health boost, jetpack thrusters, upgraded weaponry, and the ability to eject and detonate the suit.",

Brown had installed the password manager via F-Droid rather than Google Play.\n\nBitwarden, an open source password manager, is available through official channels including Google Play and Galaxy stores, as well as via F-Droid sideloading.\n\nHSBC didn't provide The Register with a clear answer on why it won't allow a sideloaded Bitwarden installation to coexist with its app on the same device.\n\nRepresentatives from both F-Droid and Bitwarden suspect the issue stems from HSBC's side.\n\nGary Orenstein, chief customer officer at Bitwarden, told us: \"It seems that HSBC has chosen a level of security and permissions for their mobile app that allows the HSBC app to see if there are other apps on the phone not installed from the Google Play store, and if one is found, to disallow the install of the HSBC app.\"\n\nBrown said that \"as far as I know, this is a decision taken by HSBC unilaterally,\" and the issues are not caused by F-Droid itself.\n\nSome have opined that HSBC configured its app safety controls, Play Integrity, to forbid operation in such cases, although this remains unconfirmed.\n\n\"In terms of the technical details, I do not know,\" Brown told us. \"It could be down to SafeNet, but I do not know for sure. There might be technical workarounds, such as using banking apps within a separate profile on the device. Or – not ideal, because of the increased cost for the user – using a separate physical device for banking apps.\"\n\n\"My approach, driven by me testing postmarketOS, is to switch back from using apps to using the provider's website.\"\n\nHSBC's response gave little away. A spokesperson said: \"Protecting our customers' accounts and personal information is our priority. Our app performs checks to identify potential malware risks and can require users to take additional steps to keep their accounts safe.\"\n\nBoth Bitwarden and F-Droid said they are open to discussing the matter with the bank, although we understand no meetings have yet been scheduled. ®",

Those new chapters added new regions of Tamriel for players to explore, additional story content, optional paid DLCs, and, occasionally, things like new classes and systems.\nZeniMax Online announced in 2024 that going forward, ESO wouldn't have a traditional yearly chapter release, labeling 2025 as a \"transitional\" year as the team prepared to focus on its plans for 2026. In a recent livestream and subsequent press Q&A attended by GameSpot, the developers have now revealed what ESO's 2026 will look like, and it includes more experimental seasonal content, battle passes, new story content, solo dungeons, a PvP progression system, class reworks, and more.",

    "fullText": "Her victory was won by the precariat: renters, transit riders, and democratic socialists who rallied, rang doorbells, created social media, and registered new voters.\n\nA day after Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration, 3,000 miles west of New York, the people of Seattle celebrated their own democratic socialist miracle, swearing in Mayor Katie Wilson. Katie beat the odds in unseating a powerful incumbent with an agenda rooted in equity and an authenticity that appealed to the city’s most precarious voters.\n\nI was lucky enough to be among the speakers at Wilson’s inauguration, which, unlike Mamdani’s, was purposefully not star-studded. There were very few suits. Mayor Wilson’s clothes were purchased at Goodwill. One thousand Seattleites crowded into City Hall, hundreds of whom had never thought of it as their home. Along with me, Katie invited three speakers who presented a mosaic of hope: a Somali American graduate student, a formerly homeless man, and an elder who reminded us over and over again to be courageous and not content.\n\nWhile Zohran was sworn in by Senator Bernie Sanders, Katie was sworn in by Pauline Van Senus, a low-income transit rider known as Seattle’s “transit fairy” for cleaning bus stops throughout the city.\n\nKatie’s victory was won by the precariat: renters, transit riders, and democratic socialists who rallied around Katie, rang doorbells for her, created dominant social media, and registered new voters.\n\nThese are not the recognized power brokers of Seattle, but Katie’s win shows they can mobilize and inspire the grassroots to elect a mayor who embraces working-class values and policy that will enable residents to thrive—including affordable childcare, transit, and housing.\n\nNow the challenge Katie faces is to universalize childcare and social housing. In previous decades, progressives have tried to create progress with incremental victories in an overwhelmingly powerful corporate context. I know this work firsthand as a longtime advocate for progressive economic policy. I’ve seen the pitfalls of this approach. It is time for fundamental, systemic, and universal progress for Seattle. Katie can bring it.\n\nIt won’t be easy, as the Trump administration and Congress are stripping funding from social services such as childcare and healthcare. Though Seattle has the means to fund these social goods, we are about to find out if our leaders have the political gumption to tax the oligarchs, the affluent, and the global corporations headquartered in Seattle, including Amazon and Starbucks.\n\nKatie has never shied away from confronting corporate power. Her first stop after the election was at a Starbucks picket line, where she proclaimed, “I’m not buying Starbucks and you should not either.” It’s not just lip service: Katie originated the JumpStart tax on large corporations.\n\nWith the election of three progressives, she now has allies on the City Council. She has built a grassroots movement that could be engaged in initiative campaigns if the City Council refuses to act. That’s how we may end up building our city. As Katie’s swearing-in ceremony demonstrated beautifully, Seattle’s new mayor has built a coalition of community organizations, workers, activists, immigrants, Democrats, socialists, childcare workers, and small businesses to win her election. Now that coalition must be plugged into actual policy advancement.\n\nKatie’s platform is about more than creating a thriving economic community. It’s also about setting the conditions that allow everyday people to enjoy the simple pleasures of life—to walk in a park, to have time to read a book. Watching Mamdani’s swearing-in from Seattle, I was moved to tears as Lucy Dacus sang “Bread and Roses.” In Seattle, Katie, echoing these lyrics, affirmed that we must open up “the time and space where life happens, where people can breathe and experience and create, where we can be full human beings and not just means to an end.… Because we need bread, but we need roses too. We deserve roses.”",

    "fullText": "Darren Michael, associate professor at Austin Peay State University, has reportedly been reinstated and given $500,000 after being fired over posts about assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nTennessee’s WKRN News 2 obtained a copy of a settlement agreement between Michael and the university, showing the school will dish out $500,000 and reimburse “therapeutic counseling services.”\n\n“APSU agrees to issue a statement acknowledging regret for not following the tenure termination process in connection with the Dispute,” the settlement reportedly reads. “The statement will be distributed via email through APSU’s reasonable communication channels to faculty, staff, and students.”\n\nThe university confirmed to WZTV in Nashville that Michael returned to his faculty position at the end of December.\n\nMichael was fired on Sept. 12 (two days after the assassination of Kirk) after social media posts about Kirk spread far and wide on social media.\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) brought attention to one post and included Michael’s photo and biography.\n\n“What do you say, [Augstin Peay]?” she wrote.\n\nWhat do you say, @austinpeay? pic.twitter.com/dTgCe4iv5l\n\n— Marsha Blackburn (@VoteMarsha) September 12, 2025\n\n“Charlie Kirk says gun deaths are ‘unfortunately’ worth it to keep 2nd Amendment,” read the headline of an article Michael shared. He did not add any additional comment on it.\n\nThe school originally said Michael was fired over “insensitive comments” made on social media.\n\n“Such actions do not align with Austin Peay’s commitment to mutual respect and human dignity,” APSU President Mike Licari said in a statement. “The university deems these actions unacceptable and has terminated the faculty member.”\n\nLicari acknowledged in a new statement that the school did not follow proper procedures in regards to Michael.\n\n“APSU did not follow the required termination process in this matter, and I deeply regret and apologize for the impact this has had on Professor Michael and on our campus community,” the university president said. “I am committed to ensuring that due process and fairness are upheld in all future actions.”\n\nThe post Professor Fired for Charlie Kirk Post Gets $500,000 From School, Is Reinstated first appeared on Mediaite.",

The driver of the truck, a 40-year-old man, was not hurt and will be subject to drug and alcohol testing, which police say is standard procedure.\n\n“Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of both the deceased,” police continued. “A report will be prepared for the coroner.”\n\nAn investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, and the Tasmania Police did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\n\nFollowing the tragic incident, a family friend, Ella Mackrell, launched a GoFundMe to help bring the teen’s body home, as well as cover expenses related to travel, lodging and the funeral.\n\nThe 16-year-old girl, identified as Adasyn Wood Savin, hailed from Newcastle, New South Wales and was visiting Rosebury during the school holiday and riding in the ATV with a family friend, according to the donation page.\n\n“She was having fun, spending time with friends, and making memories the way any 16-year-old should,” wrote Mackrell, who did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\n\n“Tragically, while riding...Adasyn and one of our beloved friends, Whitt, were hit by a car and both of them passed away at the scene,” she continued.\n\n“As Adasyn leaves us behind, we think about her parents, Amber and Adam, her brothers James Savin and Hayden Wood, and the rest of the family,” Mackrell continued, “who are now facing life without their beautiful sister, cousin, and friend.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nMackrell went on to write that the Adasyn and her brother Cooper — who previously passed away — are now \"together again, watching over their family from the stars.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday, Jan. 7, the online donation page has raised over $17,000.",

    "description": "The U.S. Navy has some of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Its newest addition is named after an important World War II ship.",
    "fullText": "The United States Navy has the largest fleet of nuclear submarines on the planet, and it just added a new one to the inventory. This new fifth generation submarine is an incredible machine, and it was named in honor of one of World War II's biggest and best vessels. On December 15, 2025, the U.S. Navy took ownership of the USS Idaho (SSN-799). The ship was named to carry on the honor of the battleship USS Idaho (BB-42), which was first commissioned in 1919 and went on to be awarded seven battle stars during WWII.\n\nThe new Idaho is the 26th Virginia-class boat. The ship is the fifth U.S. Navy vessel to carry the name \"Idaho. The first was a wooden steam sloop that was turned into a full-rigged sailing ship commissioned in 1866. The second was the BB-24, a Mississippi-class battleship. During World War I, motorboat SP-545 also carried the name before \"Idaho\" was transferred to a New Mexico-class battleship of WWII. That warship was known as \"The Big Spud\" for the state's most famous crop.\n\nIt's common for the U.S. Navy to reuse ship names in honor of historical vessels. The most well-known example is probably the USS Enterprise, as there have been nine thusly-named vessels, three of which are aircraft carriers. The new USS Idaho will undergo a series of sea trials prior to its official commissioning, which will likely take place sometime in the spring of 2026. In the meantime, dedicated submariners will get to know the boat, which is expected to help strengthen the nation's undersea warfare capabilities.\n\nThe USS Idaho (SSN-799) is one of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Virginia-class subs are designated to be attack platforms with the capability to launch cruise missiles. They're used primarily for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering, and they can operate in blue-water oceans as well as in littoral areas along coastlines. The class is slowly replacing the cruise-missile variant of the Ohio class and other nuclear submarines in the Los Angeles class.\n\nAs of this writing, three Virginia-class boats are earmarked for the Royal Australian Navy, while the rest remain with the U.S. Navy. The USS Idaho measures 377 feet long with a displacement of 10,200 tons of seawater when submerged. The boat utilizes an S9G reactor alongside an auxiliary diesel engine and has a maximum speed of around 29 mph. Like other vessels of its class, the Idaho will be home to 128 enlisted personnel and 17 officers.\n\nBecause the boat is powered by nuclear energy, it has virtually an unlimited range and will likely remain in service for at least 40 years. In terms of armament, the USS Idaho features two Virginia Payload Tubes and four additional payload tubes capable of firing the BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile. Additionally, it features four 21-inch torpedo tubes to fire the U.S. Navy's MK-48 heavy torpedo.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth aggressively jumped in to cut off Secretary of State Marco Rubio to yell at a reporter on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe two Cabinet members had just come out of a meeting to brief senators on the U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and explain the path forward.\n\nRubio had been taking a series of questions from reporters when he was asked about how much involvement in Venezuela would cost U.S. taxpayers before being cut off.\n\nThe secretary of state insisted it would not cost the U.S. any money and claimed the oil deal would not either.\n\n“None of these troops sit in a dry dock waiting for action,” Rubio said. “They’re deployed somewhere in the world. If they’re not here, they’re somewhere else.”\n\nHe argued that if the ships were not in the Caribbean, they would be ”somewhere else conducting activity.”\n\nHegseth had been standing by, at times smirking, as Rubio spoke, but then he stepped forward, forcing the Secretary of State to shift aside, so he could chime in.\n\n“I want to emphasize that question from CNN,” Hegseth said, glaring at the reporter Manu Raju before launching a verbal attack.\n\n“The questions never asked how much does it cost when they’re in the Mediterranean, or the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean or the Pacific, but now that they’re in our hemisphere and a counter cartel mission or ensuring an indicted individual comes to justice, now now you’re asking the question of cost,” Hegseth raged, gesturing his hand for emphasis. “It’s a disingenuous question to begin with.”\n\nBut the defense secretary did not stop there as he continued to rant at the reporter who tried to respond.\n\n“You’re trying to find any angle possible to undermine the success of one of the most historic military missions the world has ever seen,” Hegseth declared.\n\nThe defense secretary went on to claim that the operation in Venezuela was one that only the U.S. could accomplish and argued the world is “taking notice of that.”\n\nHe went on to tout the seizure of oil tankers being pursued by the U.S.\n\nWhile Rubio had been taking questions, Hegseth ignored follow-up attempts from reporters and instead spoke louder.\n\n“Our military is prepared to continue this as he said,” Hegseth said, gesturing back to Rubio. “The president when he speaks, he means it, means it. He’s not messing around. We’re an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”\n\nHe then quickly stepped back without taking a single question as Rubio pointed out that the officials needed to go brief members of the House.\n\nHegseth ignored questions and beat a hasty retreat as questions were yelled about whether the U.S. would put boots on the ground and more.\n\nBefore the defense secretary’s rant in front of the cameras, Rubio attempted to lay out the Trump administration’s plan for Venezuela and insisted that, despite criticism, they’re not just winging it.\n\nHe outlined that stabilizing the country relied heavily on the “quarantine” as leverage and execution of a deal to take the oil out of Venezuela. He repeated the claim that the U.S. would take out 30 to 50 million barrels of oil and sell it.\n\n“That money would then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime,” Rubio argued.\n\nThe secretary of state said the second phase would be making sure the U.S. has access to the Venezuelan market that’s “fair.” He said the third phase would be the transition. He did not provide a timeline.\n\nDemocratic senators coming out of the briefing slammed the Trump administration’s plan and warned many questions were left unanswered.\n\n“This is an insane plan. They are talking about stealing the Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time undefined as leverage to micromanage the country,” said Senator Chris Murphy. “The scope and insanity of that plan is absolutely stunning.”",

    "description": "Taiwan is searching for a missing F-16 fighter jet and pilot after an incident earlier this week.",
    "fullText": "A Taiwanese F-16 fighter jet and its pilot went missing off the island's northeast coast on Tuesday.\n\nTaiwan's Air Force has grounded its F-16 fleet and suspended training missions in response.\n\nSearch and rescue operations are still ongoing. Right now, it's unclear whether the pilot ejected.\n\nTaiwan's air force has grounded its F-16 fleet and suspended training missions on the jet after one of the planes and the pilot went missing earlier this week.\n\nThe search continues for the pilot and aircraft, which officials believe went down following an in-flight \"anomaly,\" but rough seas off the island have made efforts difficult.\n\nOn Tuesday night local time, an American-made F-16 fighter jet assigned to the Taiwan Air Force's Fifth Tactical Air Wing operating out of Hualien Air Base went missing in the waters off the northeast coast of the island. The Air Force said the fighter was separated from a group during a nighttime training session after the jets entered cloud cover.\n\nThe F-16 suddenly descended quickly. Its altitude was just 1,700 feet when radar contact was lost. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has identified the missing pilot as Capt. Hsin Po-yi. Officials remain unsure whether Hsin successfully ejected from the aircraft, although he had indicated he would eject seconds before the aircraft disappeared. It's unclear if he did.\n\nIn the days since the incident, a search and rescue mission has been ongoing in the waters off Hualien County. Multiple aircraft and vessels have been involved in the mission, but tall waves and strong winds have been complicating the search for the jet and Hsin.\n\nAir Force officials told reporters during a press conference on Wednesday that there appeared to be a malfunction of the F-16's main onboard computer in which the aircraft's flight path was no longer displayed.\n\nNow, Taiwanese air force officials have grounded all of Taiwan's F-16 fleet for inspections, and training missions have been temporarily suspended. Taiwan currently has about 140 F-16s, the older A/B models, that it has upgraded in recent years. It is expected to receive a batch of the newer F-16V or Viper jets in the coming years to add to its fleet.\n\nThe F-16 is made by American defense giant Lockheed Martin. Though it's been flying for over 50 years, it still represents a highly capable fourth-generation jet. The newest operator of the aircraft is Ukraine, which received a limited number from NATO partner nations.\n\nThis crash involving the Taiwanese military follows a similar incident that occurred in January 2022, when a Taiwanese F-16 went down off the island's west coast while taking part in training exercises. At the time, the F-16 went missing after taking off from Chiayi Air Base in southern Taiwan. In response, Taiwan suspended its combat training for the fleet.\n\nIt's not uncommon to see fleets grounded after accidents, especially if the cause is unclear. The US military has done this regularly.\n\nTaiwan's Air Force has been strained in recent years by constant scrambling to track Chinese military aircraft, which regularly fly into the country's air defense identification zone. Taipei's smaller air force has experienced higher operational tempos that have exhausted pilots, aircraft, and resources and stressed maintainers. Most recently, Taiwan held rapid response drills in reaction to China's massive exercises nearby.",

    "title": "Common food preservatives linked to cancer and type 2 diabetes",
    "description": "Two large studies found a significant association between eating preservatives in many foods and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and several cancers.",
    "fullText": "Common preservatives used to keep food safe and extend shelf life may be linked to a higher risk of several cancers and type 2 diabetes, according to two new studies from France.\n\n“These are very important findings for preservatives that are not only widely used in the French and European markets, but also in the United States,” said senior author Mathilde Touvier, principal investigator of the NutriNet-Santé study used to conduct the research.\n\nThe NutriNet-Santé study, which began in 2009, compares over 170,000 participants’ web-based reports on diet and lifestyle with their medical data stored in the French national health care system.\n\n“These are the two first studies in the world investigating the associations between exposure to these food additives and cancer and type 2 diabetes,” said Touvier, who is also the director of research at France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris, “and so we must be very cautious about the message. Obviously, the results need to be confirmed.”\n\nDespite those caveats, “the concern raised about preservatives is one more reason among many to emphasize the personal and public health importance of fresh, whole, minimally processed foods, mostly plants,” Dr. David Katz said in an email.\n\nKatz, who was not involved in the study, is a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.\n\nThe cancer study, published Wednesday in The BMJ journal, closely examined the impact of 58 preservatives on some 105,000 people who were free of cancer in 2009 and were followed for up to 14 years. Only those who completed frequent 24-hour, brand-specific food questionnaires were included. People who ate the most preservative-laced food were compared with those who ate the least.\n\nResearchers did a deep dive on 17 preservatives consumed by at least 10% of the participants and found 11 of those had no relationship with cancer. However, the six that were linked to cancer are considered GRAS, or “generally recognized as safe” in food by the US Food and Drug Administration. Those include sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, sorbates, potassium metabisulfite, acetates and acetic acid.\n\nSodium nitrite, a chemical salt commonly used in processed meats such as bacon, ham and deli meats, was associated with a 32% increase in the risk of prostate cancer. It’s cousin, potassium nitrate, was associated with a 22% higher risk of breast cancer and a 13% increase in all cancers. The World Health Organization has long considered processed meat as a carcinogen, with a direct link to colon cancer.\n\nSorbates, especially potassium sorbate, were associated with a 26% higher risk for breast cancer and a 14% increase in all types of cancers. These water-soluble salts are used in wine, baked goods, cheeses and sauces to prevent molds, yeast and some bacteria.\n\nPotassium metabisulfite, often used in winemaking and brewing, was associated with a 20% increase in breast cancer and 11% higher risk of all cancers, according to the study.\n\nAcetates, which come from natural fermentation and are used in foods such as meat, sauces, breads and cheese, were linked to a 25% higher risk of breast cancer and 15% increase in cancer in general. Acetic acid, the main ingredient in vinegar, was associated with a 12% increase in the risk of all cancers, the study found.\n\nOther types of preservatives — antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, plant extracts like rosemary and such synthetic preservatives as butylated hydroxyanisole — were also studied. While these more “natural” preservatives are often linked to lower cancer risk when eaten as whole foods, they may be harmful when used as additives, Touvier said.\n\n“The hypothesis here is when you isolate one substance from its original matrix of a whole fruit or vegetable, the action on our health can be different depending on the way our gut microbiota will digest it,” she said.\n\nOnly two antioxidant preservatives were linked to cancer, the study found. Sodium erythorbate and other erythorbates, which are made from fermented sugars, were associated with a 21% higher incidence of breast cancer and 12% increase in cancer overall.\n\nErythorbates are used to prevent discoloration and spoilage in poultry, soft drinks and baked goods, to name a few. Sodium erythorbate is often used in processed meats to speed up the curing process.\n\nObservational studies are subject to error due to the lack of control over variables that might also influence outcomes. However, a major strength of this study was its ability to adjust for preservatives from natural sources and other food additives as well as its “detailed assessment of preservative intake, through repeated 24-hour dietary records,” according to an editorial published with the study.\n\n“We also looked at what colleagues have published on the impact of these preservative chemicals on animal models, cellular models, gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammatory processes which may explain what we observe,” Touvier said.\n\nIn addition, both studies controlled for such confounding factors as a physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, medication use and lifestyle factors, Touvier said.\n\n“The finding that specific classes of preservatives are associated with increased risk of select cancers was robust to all of these adjustments, indicating it is a matter that warrants respect and requires further research,” Katz said.\n\nThe type 2 diabetes study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications, examined the role of preservatives and the potential risk of type 2 diabetes in nearly 109,000 of the NutriNet-Santé participants who did not have the disease at the start of the study.\n\nTwelve of the 17 preservatives researchers examined were linked with nearly a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people who consumed the highest levels.\n\nFive of the same preservatives that caused cancer — potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic acid and sodium acetate — also raised the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In this case the probability rose by 49%, according to the research.\n\nA sixth preservative — calcium propionate — was also connected. It’s a white powder used to stop mold and bacterial growth.\n\nIn this study on type 2 diabetes, more than two antioxidant additives increased risk. Additives that increased risk by 42% included alpha-tocopherol, the most bioavailable form of vitamin E; sodium ascorbate, which is a buffered form of vitamin C and sodium; rosemary extracts; sodium erythorbate, made from fermented sugar; phosphoric acid, a preservative in sodas, processed meats, cheeses and other foods; and citric acid, a flavor enhancer, preservative and pH adjuster with no significant nutritional value.\n\nSince these two studies are the first to examine the role of preservatives in the development of cancer and type 2 diabetes, much more research will be required to confirm and expand the findings, said Anaïs Hasenböhler, the first author of both studies who is a doctoral student at the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team at the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord.\n\nHowever, Hasenböhler added in a statement, “These new data add to others in favour of a reassessment of the regulations governing the general use of food additives by the food industry in order to improve consumer protection.”\n\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.",

    "fullText": "McDonald’s stock has been languishing due to slower earnings growth.\n\nThe company’s recession-resistant business model may appeal to risk-averse investors.\n\nMcDonald’s predictable cash flow from franchisees supports future dividend raises.\n\n10 stocks we like better than McDonald's ›\n\nWith the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) hovering around an all-time high, some investors may be more interested in cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) stocks than a stodgy fast food giant like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD). After all, selling burgers and fries may lack the glitz and glamour of a high-octane growth story, but it can be just the ticket for powering your passive income stream in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHere's why McDonald's is a top Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) component to buy in January.\n\nLast October, McDonald's raised its dividend for the 49th consecutive year -- putting McDonald's on track to become a Dividend King in 2026.\n\nDividend Kings are companies that have raised their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years. To pull off that feat, companies must consistently grow earnings so they can afford the higher dividend expense. The dividend becomes a key priority for returning capital to shareholders and managing investor expectations.\n\nHowever, plenty of Dividend Kings are stodgy, slow-growing consumer staples and industrial companies. Unlike Dividend Kings that are past their prime, McDonald's is an ultra-high-margin cash cow with a track record of rewarding shareholders with solid returns on top of the dividend -- with McDonald's producing a 229% total return over the last decade. But McDonald's has cooled, with the stock up just under 15% in the last three years compared to a nearly 80% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nThe restaurant industry has been under pressure because it depends on consumer discretionary spending. Sit-down restaurants that rely on experiences have been struggling the most, whereas restaurants that cater to convenience and value are doing relatively better.\n\nIn McDonald's latest quarter, which was the third quarter of 2025, comparable sales increased by 3.6% and systemwide sales grew by 8% year over year. Systemwide revenue refers to McDonald's restaurants that are corporate-owned or franchised.\n\nSimilarly, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR), which is a quick-service restaurant conglomerate that owns Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes, and Firehouse Subs, grew systemwide sales by 6.9% in the third quarter of 2025, including 4% comparable sales growth.",

    "description": "\"I want to properly understand.\"",
    "fullText": "Tens of thousands of years ago, a new study suggests, a warming event led to the release of carbon dioxide from deep in the Southern Ocean. Now, scientists say, these findings could shed light on the potential fallout from continued warming in the Antarctic.\n\nLed by scientists at the Laoshan Laboratory in Qingdao, China, and Germany's GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, the study looked at sediment cores from the Southern Ocean to understand the behavior of Antarctic Bottom Water, or AABW.\n\n​​\"We wanted to understand how the influence of Antarctic Bottom Water, the coldest and densest water mass in the global ocean, changed during the last deglaciation, and what role it played in the global carbon cycle,\" said Huang Huang, who led the study, in a GEOMAR press release.\n\nThe researchers' findings, published recently in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggest that AABW expansion helped bring the last Ice Age to an end.\n\n\"As the planet warmed and the ice sheets melted between about 18,000 and 10,000 years ago, the volume of Antarctic Bottom Water expanded in two distinct phases,\" according to the release.\n\n\"These phases coincided with known warming events in Antarctica. As vertical mixing in the Southern Ocean increased, the carbon that had been stored in the deep ocean was able to return to the atmosphere.\"\n\nThe research team found that the deepest waters stayed fairly stagnant and out of touch with shallower waters until the Earth began to warm. When the water was stirred up by the expansion created by the warming of the planet, carbon stores were released into the Earth's atmosphere, forcing temperatures higher.\n\nThe team's study goes back tens of thousands of years and thousands of meters down into the ocean. But its insights could be relevant today and on land where countless communities are vulnerable to the impacts of rising global temperatures.\n\n\"Comparisons with the past are always imperfect, but ultimately it comes down to how much energy is in the system,\" said GEOMAR geochemist Marcus Gutjahr, per the release. \"If we understand how the ocean responded to warming in the past, we can better grasp what is happening today as Antarctic ice shelves continue to melt.\"\n\nDeep Southern Ocean waters have warmed faster than most others in the past half-century. If the warming waters and thawing ice repeat the patterns of the past, huge amounts of carbon could be released into the atmosphere again and contribute to subsequent temperature rise.\n\nShould we be pouring money into nuclear fusion technology?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"I want to properly understand the modern ocean in order to interpret signals from the past,\" Gutjahr said. \"If we can trace how Antarctic Bottom Water has changed over the last few thousand years, we can assess more accurately how rapidly the Antarctic Ice Sheet may continue to lose mass in the future.\"\n\nOther studies have shown that sea ice levels have dropped alarmingly over the last 50 years.\n\nAdvances in this field could help world leaders and global organizations prepare for the potentially catastrophic consequences of continued planetary warming. Evidence about the threats of sea level rise, food system disruptions, and disease spread can inform adaptation strategies.\n\nBut such alarming findings could also help stir meaningful public action now to mitigate rising temperatures, such as transitioning to cleaner home energy systems and transportation options.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The Michigan parents were on the hook for up to $15,000 worth of damage",
    "fullText": "Michigan parents have claimed insurance company Geico refused to cover their car crash because their young children weren’t listed on their policy.\n\nKara Vogel and Carson Howatt of Chelsea got into a crash on Christmas Eve last month with their 1-and-a-half-year-old daughter and 3-month-old son. Howatt told local news no one was injured in the minor crash.\n\n“We were going through a roundabout and a driver came on our right side and just didn’t yield to the roundabout and just hit us right in the front of our car,” Vogel told local news outlet Click On Detroit.\n\nThe damage to the family’s car could cost between $5,000 and $15,000. The parents said they were told it wouldn’t be covered since their children were not listed on their insurance policy. The family has used Geico since they bought their car six months ago, before their son was even born.\n\n“They asked if they are my kids and if they lived with me,” Howatt said. “I didn’t think anything of it, so, I was, like, ‘Yes, of course, they are my kids and they live with me and they were in the car when the accident occurred, in their car seats, but no one was hurt.’”\n\nHowatt admitted he signed a form stating that he and his wife were the only ones in their household.\n\n“We weren’t thinking, like, ‘This is going to completely ruin our financial situation.’ It didn’t seem big. The airbags didn’t go off,” Vogel said.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the family and to Geico for comment.\n\nGeico explained in a statement to Click On Detroit that “all household residents must be listed on the auto policy, regardless of age,” according to Michigan law. The state reformed no-fault auto insurance in 2019, including Personal Injury Protection requirements.\n\nThe issue was eventually resolved and the family said they won’t have to pay out of pocket. But they said Geico told them they would need to add their children to their policy.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance interest rates. The 30-year fixed rate has seen little movement since October. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates have sustained a long stretch of stability. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate is 6.01%, down three basis points. Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed home loan rate is up four basis points to 5.45%. These small moves in either direction have been the norm for many weeks.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.01% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the last cut to the federal funds rate in December, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates have been stuck in a rut — but there was a general move lower over the past couple of months. According to Freddie Mac data, 30-year mortgage rates remain about a half-point below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.\n\nZillow Home Loans isn’t just a marketplace — it’s also a mortgage lender with conventional, FHA, and VA loans, to name a few.

    "fullText": "An 18-year-old student charged with murder in the stabbing death of a classmate was denied bond on Wednesday.\n\nAundre Matthews is accused of killing Andrew Meismer after a fight between the two escalated during a science class at Sterling High School in Baytown, according to court records. Investigators say the dispute began over a $21 vape pen Matthews said was missing and believed that Meismer took.\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Cory Scott, an investigator with the Goose Creek Police Department, testified to seeing \"quite a bit\" of blood in the classroom, on the floor, and splattered on the wall on the day of the incident.\n\nWednesday's hearing was also one of the first under the new state law in which a prosecutor can request a defendant be held with no bond in non-capital offenses.\n\n\"It's brand new. This is the constitutional amendment that, as we've talked about, gives prosecutors and the judiciary another tool in the toolbox to ensure that people (who) shouldn't be out get to stay in,\" Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare said following Matthews' hearing.\n\nDuring the hearing, Matthews showed no visible emotion as prosecutors and defense attorneys argued whether he should be eligible for bond. Meismer's family was present in the courtroom.\n\nDetective Scott also presented surveillance video from inside the school. While the video was not released publicly, prosecutors described footage showing Matthews and Meismer entering an empty science lab together. Minutes later, a teacher's aide was seen pushing Matthews out of the room.\n\nProsecutors told the judge that Matthews stabbed Meismer inside the lab and argued that Matthews poses an ongoing threat to the community.\n\n\"It took over a minute to pry this defendant from this victim,\" a prosecutor said in court, adding that Matthews allegedly held Meismer in a chokehold as blood poured from his wounds.\n\nThe state also introduced Matthews' school disciplinary records, which prosecutors said showed an escalating pattern of behavior, including a prior incident in which he allegedly brought a knife to school.\n\nJudge Emily Detoto cited those school records as a key factor in her decision to deny bond.\n\n\"The school records are voluminous,\" DA Teare said, \"and they indicate an escalating pattern of behavior.\"\n\nMatthews' defense attorney, Gian Paolo Mecerola, said he was not surprised by the ruling but argued that responsibility also lies with the school district. He noted that Matthews was part of a special education program and said the district was aware of behavioral concerns but allowed him to continue attending school.\n\n\"There are clearly issues here,\" Mecerola said, adding that Matthews is being raised by his sister, who is his legal guardian. He said he is continuing to investigate those circumstances.\n\nDistrict Attorney Teare emphasized that the hearing was not a determination of guilt or innocence. Instead, he said, it was narrowly focused on whether Matthews should remain in custody while the case moves forward. The case has not yet been presented to a grand jury, and no trial date has been set.\n\n\"This is whole new for everyone,\" Teare said of the bond denial process. \"We don't have a full-time frame yet.\"\n\nAndrew Meissmer's family attended the hearing but declined to comment afterward.\n\nThe case remains in its early stages, and Matthews will continue to be held without bond as the legal process continues.\n\nHigh school student dies after being stabbed by a classmate in Baytown, Goose Creek CISD says\n\nHarris County DA's office accepts murder charge for teen accused in classmate's stabbing: Officials\n\n$3 million bond for student accused of stabbing friend in school, as school district stays quiet\n\nFor news updates, follow Miya Shay on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "description": "-Mughrabi Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man.",
    "fullText": "Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man. On December 29, Hamas announced that he had died, aged 49, around seven months after Israel said it killed him in a strike.\n\nHamas did not provide details on Sinwar's death but ​said it mourned him along with other group leaders, describing them as \"heroic martyrs\". Hamas confirmed in the statement that Sinwar had been the head of the group's armed forces.\n\nSinwar was elevated ‌to the top ranks of Hamas in 2024 after the death in combat of his brother Yahya, mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel that led to the war in Gaza and later overall leader of the Palestinian organisation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ‌in May 2025 that Sinwar had been killed. Less than two weeks later, the Israeli army said it had retrieved Sinwar's body in an underground tunnel beneath a hospital in southern Gaza.\n\nSinwar's death is expected to leave his next in command Izzeldeen Haddad, who had been overseeing operations in northern Gaza, in charge of Hamas' armed wing across the whole of the enclave.\n\nIt is unclear how the death will affect decision-making in Hamas more broadly - for example, whether it will bolster or diminish the influence of exiled members of the group's leadership council on policy matters, in particular the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire plan agreed with Israel in October.\n\nHamas officials described ⁠Sinwar as a \"ghost\" who long outfoxed Israel's intelligence agencies.\n\nLike his brother Yahya, Sinwar ‌had survived many Israeli assassination attempts, including airstrikes and planted explosives, Hamas sources said.\n\nWhen Sinwar once visited a cemetery, his comrades discovered a remote-controlled explosive resembling a brick planted along his path, according to the Hamas sources.\n\nIn 2003, Hamas operatives discovered a bomb in the wall of Mohammad Sinwar's house, foiling an assassination attempt that the ‍group blamed on Israeli intelligence.\n\nKnown for clandestine operations, Mohammad Sinwar played a central role in planning and executing Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the country's worst security failure, Hamas sources said.\n\nHe was also widely believed to have been one of the masterminds of the 2006 cross-border attack and abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.\n\nHamas held Shalit for five years before he was swapped for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel.\n\nUnder the deal, his brother Yahya Sinwar, whose ​meticulous planning for the 2023 attack shattered Israel's reputation as an invincible power in a hostile region, was among those who were released.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to eradicate Hamas. The offensive against ‌Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces, the Middle East's most advanced military, severely weakened the organisation.\n\nYahya Sinwar was killed in combat during a routine Israeli patrol in Gaza in 2024.\n\nIsrael released footage of a severely wounded Yahya Sinwar throwing a piece of wood at a hovering drone - his last act of defiance towards his old foe before his death and his brother's rise.\n\nBut the group, which was created during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in 1987 and which carried out suicide bombings that traumatised Israelis in the second one, is still standing.\n\nBorn on September 16, 1975, Sinwar rarely appeared in public or spoke to the media. He granted a lengthy interview to Al Jazeera for a documentary broadcast in 2022, but wore a cap and sat in the dark to hide his appearance.\n\nThe Sinwars originally came from Asqalan - now the Israeli ⁠city of Ashkelon, a short distance to the north of the Gaza Strip. Alongside hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, ​they became refugees in what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, at the time of Israel's declaration of independence during the ​1948 war.\n\nThe family settled in Khan Younis in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble in the latest war.\n\nMohammad Sinwar was educated in schools run by the United Nations' Palestinian relief agency (UNRWA), which has long been a target of Israeli criticism, including during the recent war in Gaza.\n\nHe joined Hamas shortly after its founding, influenced by his brother ‍Yahya, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the ⁠oldest and at one time most influential Islamist group in the Middle East.\n\nHis reputation as a hardliner helped him rise through the group's military ranks. By 2005, he was leading Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade.\n\nThe unit, one of the largest and most powerful battalions in Hamas' armed wing, has been responsible for cross-border attacks, firing rockets and planting bombs along the frontier. “Striking Tel Aviv is easier than ⁠drinking water,\" Sinwar told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe unit also watches the movements of Israeli soldiers around the clock. In 2006, elite commandos led by Sinwar took part in Shalit's abduction.\n\nSources close to Hamas say Sinwar developed close ties with Marwan Issa, the deputy commander ‌of Hamas' military wing, and Mohammed Deif, the aloof military chief. Both men were killed by Israel in 2024.\n\nIn its statement announcing Sinwar's death on December 29, Hamas said that ‌he had succeeded Deif.",

Vice-chair Greg Abel took over the top job as of Jan. 1, 2026 while Buffett will remain as chairman.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nDespite this shake-up, Buffett is confident about Berkshire Hathaway’s legacy.\n\n“It has a better chance I think of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,” Buffett said during an interview with CNBC (2).\n\nWith a net worth like his, you might anticipate Buffett living out a lavish retirement.\n\nBut unlike the high-roller lifestyles of other extremely rich celebrities and business people, Warren Buffett lives by smart — and surprisingly simple — investment philosophies that have positively influenced millions of investors around the world. One of his most famous rules is to buy and hold for as long as possible.\n\n“You’ve got to be prepared when you buy a stock to have it go down 50% or more, and be comfortable with it … but some people are not really careful,” Buffett said during Berkshire Hathaway’s 2020 annual shareholder meeting (3).\n\n“Some people are more subject to fear than others.”\n\nHere’s how to fight the fear and build a better future.\n\nMarket volatility isn’t exactly a foreign concept for the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett began investing when he was 11, back in 1942. Having lived through several recessions, Buffett has, time and again, shrugged off short-term market volatility.\n\n“Over the long term, the stock market news will be good,” Buffett wrote in an Op-Ed for the NY Times in 2008 (4).\n\n“In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.”",
