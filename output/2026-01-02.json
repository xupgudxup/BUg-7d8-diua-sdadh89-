    "fullText": "Ole Miss vs. Miami predictions: Expert picks and odds for 2025 CFP semifinal at Fiesta Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNo. 6 Ole Miss will meet No. 10 Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Thursday, Jan. 8.\n\nKickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPN.\n\nOle Miss (13-1) stunned No. 3 Georgia 39-34 in the Allstate Sugar Bowl behind an incredible effort from quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, who led a second-half comeback with 362 passing yards and two TDs. Pete Golding – who replaced Lane Kiffin after the coach left for LSU – has a chance to lead the Rebels to the CFP championship game for the first time in school history.\n\nMiami (12-2) made a program statement with a 24-14 victory against No. 2 Ohio State in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic. Beck averages 120.5 passing yards with two TDs and no interceptions in two playoff games. Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor have led a nasty defense that has allowed 8.5 points through two playoff games. Mario Cristobal has a chance to push the Hurricanes to their first national championship game since 2003 – which was also at the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nMORE: Hurricane Bane is a Category 5 for Miami\n\nHere is an early look at the betting odds and our pick for the winner of the Fiesta Bowl. Odds courtesy of Caesars:\n\nMoneyline: Miami -160, Ole Miss +135\n\nOle Miss is 1-1 ATS as an underdog this season, and both games were against Georgia. The Rebels were 5-1 S/U in games with a spread of seven points or less. The Hurricanes are 2-0 S/U and 2-0 ATS when favored by seven points or less.\n\nMiami's pass rush wrecked the Ohio State game plan in the CFP quarterfinals. Bain has four of the Hurricanes' 12 sacks in the playoff. Mesidor has three sacks in those two games, and they have combined for 26 pressures.\n\nChambliss, however, presents a different challenge with his escapability outside the pocket. That pass rush will have to land, and Chambliss made Georgia pay with receivers Harrison Wallace III and De'Zhaun Stribling. How many risks will Chambliss take against a Miami secondary that features Bryce Fitzgerald (6 INTs), Jakobe Thomas (5 INTs) and Keionte Scott (2 INTs), who had the game-turning pick six against the Buckeyes?\n\nThe other piece is Kewan Lacy, a tough running back who has played through a shoulder injury the last two games. The Rebels are a different challenge for Miami defensive coordinator Corey Hetherman.\n\nMiami will attack Georgia with Mark Fletcher Jr., a tough inside runner who will try to attack the middle with defensive tackles Zxavian Harris and Will Echoles. Sunatrine Perkins and Princewell Umanmielen add to that pass rush. Malachi Toney and CJ Daniels will challenge the Ole Miss secondary in the intermediate passing game.\n\nHow will Beck handle the opportunity to get to the CFP championship game? Beck has thrown just one interception since the 26-20 loss to SMU on Nov. 1, and he has great protection from an offensive line led by Francis Mauigoa.\n\nMiami has not allowed more than 26 points in a game this season – but they have not faced a quarterback like Chambliss either. That is where this matchup will be decided. He passed for 300 or more yards in four of Ole Miss' last five games, and the Rebels are riding the same momentum wave as the Hurricanes. This makes for an almost impossible choice.\n\nSN AWARDS: 2025 All-America team | Player of the Year | Coach of the Year\n\nWhere Texas Tech-Oregon ranks among low-scoring CFP games\n\nYep, Arch Manning leads the 2026 Heisman race\n\nRanking top QBs in transfer portal",

    "fullText": "Giants legend Eli Manning shares video of hilarious hoverboard fail appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe New York Giants flopped in 2025, and their greatest quarterback of all-time did the same to begin 2026. Eli Manning posted a video of himself riding a hoverboard on New Year’s Day, refusing to hide from his mistakes. He fell backwards in the water, but the two-time Super Bowl MVP is in high spirits following his thrilling experience.\n\n“Who says you can’t teach an old dog new tricks?” he remarked on X. “Happy New Year!” Manning seems to be having much more fun than his beloved Giants, as they take a 3-13 record into the final week of the regular season. The good news is they will have plenty of time for hoverboarding or any outdoor activity of their choice.\n\nWho says you can’t teach an old dog new tricks? Happy New Year! pic.twitter.com/crGzBVhJb0\n\n— Eli Manning (@EliManning) January 1, 2026\n\nThe Giants legend is probably gaining even more pleasure from this holiday excursion in light of the recent news. Manning is once again in the running for Hall of Fame enshrinement. He is one of 15 finalists who will have a chance to be inducted into Cooperstown next summer. It is probably good for him to have a healthy distraction.\n\nThough, whether he is agonizing over his Hall of Fame case, watching Big Blue play or picking up a new hobby, the result appears to be the same. Pain.\n\nEli Manning is surely proud of fellow Ole Miss alum Jaxson Dart, however. He underwent some intense growing pains in his rookie 2004-05 season, averaging just 115.9 passing yards per game and throwing six touchdowns to nine interceptions. Ultimately, the second-generation talent persevered and went on to complete two of the most iconic passes in NFL history. Perhaps he can give some inspiration to Dart in the offseason.\n\nManning can also take his own advice, as he tries to conquer the hoverboard.",

    "fullText": "NEW ORLEANS − Ole Miss football is still playing in the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe Rebels beat Georgia 39-34 in the Sugar Bowl. Ole Miss won on a 47-yard field goal kick from Lucas Carneiro with nine seconds remaining. Ole Miss added a safety\n\nWith the win, Ole Miss (13-1) advances to the semifinals of the CFP. Georgia (12-2) is eliminated. Ole Miss will face No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 8.\n\nThe Rebels will be the higher-seeded team in the Fiesta Bowl and look poised to continue their run. Ole Miss won through its stars.\n\nQuarterback Trinidad Chambliss was remarkable. He was 30-for-46 for 362 yards and two touchdowns. Chambliss evaded Georgia pass rushers (zero sacks) and threw no interceptions.\n\nRunning back Kewan Lacy was elite. He bounced back from an early fumble and rushed for 98 yards on 22 carries. He had two scores.\n\nIf Ole Miss gets that level of production, it has the capability to beat Miami, No. 1 Indiana or No. 5 Oregon.\n\nThere was pressure on Ole Miss coach Pete Golding entering the CFP.\n\nIf the Rebels were beaten by Tulane at home in the first round of the CFP, it would be a quick, disappointing end to Golding's first chance as a head coach. The same thing applies if Ole Miss was embarassed in the second round against Georgia.\n\nNeither happened. Ole Miss crushed Tulane 45-10 and bounced the SEC champions. It's given the post-Lane Kiffin era tremendous momentum.\n\nA pair of drops from Ole Miss pass catchers had a noticable impact.\n\nTight end Dae'Quan Wright dropped a ball on third-and-3 with two minutes remaining in the first half. Ole Miss punted on the next play.\n\nThe second came with 18 seconds remaining in the first half. The Rebels were driving in an attempt to get into field goal position when receiver Harrison Wallace dropped a pass at the UGA 28-yard line. Two plays later, time expired in the half just before the Rebels could attempt a kick.\n\nThe game sounded more like an Ole Miss home game than a neutral site bowl game.\n\nOle Miss fans packed the east side of the Caesars Superdome. Georgia fans were certainly noticeable on the west side but most of the seats on both end zones were occupied by those wearing powder blue.\n\nSam Hutchens covers Ole Miss for the Clarion Ledger.

    "fullText": "In a Sugar Bowl classic between two SEC teams fighting for a spot in the College Football Playoff semifinals, one of the biggest winners was in Baton Rouge. Financially, at least.\n\nLane Kiffin, the former Ole Miss coach who left the program last month for LSU, will receive a $500,000 bonus from his new employer thanks to his former team reaching the CFP semifinal via a thrilling 39-34 win over Georgia. The bonus is part of an agreement LSU reached with the coach to lure him from Oxford, offering him the same bonuses he would have received for each CFP victory had he stayed at Ole Miss.\n\nKiffin had already received a $250,000 bonus after the Rebels defeated Tulane in the first round. If they defeat No. 10 Miami in the next round, Kiffin will add another $750,000 to his tally.\n\nAnd if they were to win one more for the program’s first title in decades? One of the most bittersweet $1 million payments in the history of sports.\n\nPete Golding, the defensive coordinator who stayed at Ole Miss to take over as head coach, will receive the same bonuses. On his way out, Kiffin insisted on staying to coach the Rebels in the playoff, but the school understandably didn’t want a coach of another SEC team to be running its program during a key part of recruiting season.\n\nIt was an open question whether Kiffin would show up in New Orleans on Thursday to watch his former players and coaches face Georgia, but he decided to stick with his current school instead. He made an appearance on the court at the LSU women’s basketball team’s game, embracing head coach Kim Mulkey.\n\nNo. 5-ranked LSU took its first loss of the season, falling 80-78 to No. 11 Kentucky. After the game, it appears Kiffin did make it to New Orleans, or at least his family did.\n\nWhat a great finish!!! So much fun!! Only two more to go ⁦@OleMissFB⁩ 🇹🇹 🪄 🏆 #BTA pic.twitter.com/axTTTHP5pO\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) January 2, 2026\n\nMeanwhile, Ole Miss fans were making their thoughts about the man their team was enriching very clear, with a “F*** Lane Kiffin” chant at the end of the game. The state’s governor had a similar outlook.\n\n— Governor Tate Reeves (@tatereeves) January 2, 2026\n\nThis was a situation that was surreal from the moment Kiffin started taking other schools’ calls, and it won’t get any better with Ole Miss have a very real chance at the CFP championship game.",

A few plays later, Carneiro, who’d already broken Sugar Bowl records with field goals of 55 and 56 yards, hit from 47 and sprinted triumphantly toward the Ole Miss sideline as the Rebels (13-1, CFP No. 6 seed) jubilantly swarmed around him.",

The payout comes despite Kiffin no longer coaching the team after his high-profile departure for LSU on Nov. 30.\n\nPer the structure of Kiffin’s Ole Miss contract, postseason bonuses were triggered by College Football Playoff advancement. Those incentives were absorbed by LSU as part of Kiffin’s exit agreement.\n\nKiffin had already earned $150,000 when the Ole Miss Rebels secured a spot in the 12-team CFP field.

If Ole Miss reaches the national championship game, Kiffin’s total bonus would climb to $750,000. A national title would raise it to $1 million.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrinidad Chambliss started last season at Division II Ferris State and started this season on the bench, but he is at the center of the college football world after a Sugar Bowl win over Georgia.\n\nFaced with a two-possession deficit in the second half, largely the result of his own team's mistakes, Chambliss caught fire down the stretch on Thursday night and led Ole Miss to the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 39-34 upset victory.\n\nChambliss impressed with his legs and his arm in the second half, extending plays and leading a pair of high-tempo touchdown drives in the fourth quarter to take control of a game the Rebels weren't supposed to win. When Ole Miss lost that control, Chambliss made the throw that set up a game-winning field goal.\n\nHere's a closer look at Chambliss' performance against Georgia and his top moments from the win.\n\nMORE:How missed facemask penalty nearly changed Sugar Bowl outcome\n\nChambliss finished 30-of-46 for 362 yards and two touchdowns in the win over Georgia, adding 14 rushing yards in the biggest win in Ole Miss history.\n\nChambliss broke a record for consecutive completions in the Sugar Bowl, previously held by Tim Tebow and Michael Penix Jr., and he didn't blink after falling behind by multiple possessions even as mistakes around him threatened to bury the Rebels.\n\nThe win marked a new season-high in passing yards for Chambliss, narrowly surpassing a 359-yard performance against Mississippi State in the regular season finale, and it marked his fifth game with multiple touchdown passes and no interceptions.\n\nHere's a look at some of the biggest plays Chambliss made, including a wild escape job for a first down and a critical completion that set up a game-winning field goal.\n\nMORE: How Trinidad Chambliss went from D2 afterthought to SEC star\n\nSomehow, Chambliss kept this play alive and got the ball to Kewan Lacy for a first down despite being chased back to his own one-yard line.\n\nTrinidad Chambliss and Kewan Lacy keep the drive alive, and Ole Miss takes a three-point lead in Q4 🤯\n\n🎥 @espnpic.twitter.com/0UXcQqnFPN\n\n— The Athletic (@TheAthletic) January 2, 2026\n\nChambliss found Harrison Wallace III on the run for this huge gain:\n\ntrinidad chambliss to harrison wallace; ole miss vs georgia pic.twitter.com/LcPUwESpEX\n\n— ◇ (@F0RGIAT0) January 2, 2026\n\nChambliss knew exactly when to get rid of the ball on this play:\n\nCHAMBLISS OUT HERE PLAYING MADDEN OH MY GOD🤯\npic.twitter.com/IZB3hWaasw\n\n— JUGGABETS (@mykezaa) January 2, 2026\n\nChambliss threw a dart to De'Zhaun Stribling for 40 yards and the chance to win the game on a field goal on Ole Miss' final drive.\n\nCHAMBLISS TO STRIBLING\n\nPOTENTIALLY THE DAGGER pic.twitter.com/4vAwRizyzZ\n\n— Grant (@grantsglimpse) January 2, 2026\n\nChambliss turned 23 in August, days before the start of the season.\n\nA former star at Division II Ferris State, Chambliss opened the 2025 season as a backup to starter Austin Simmons but took over after an injury to Simmons and made it impossible for Lane Kiffin to give the job back to the Week 1 starter.\n\nNow, Chambliss is anticipating an NCAA decision on his eligibility after he filed a waiver to play in 2026. Whether he would stay in Oxford or test the transfer portal waters isn't clear, but the NFL Draft could also be an option as he builds his value in the College Football Playoff.\n\nMORE:Explaining Trinidad Chambliss' upcoming waiver decision\n\nChambliss attended Forest Hills Northern in Grand Rapids, Michigan, before committing to nearby Ferris State.\n\nAfter winning two titles at the Division II level, Chambliss transferred to Ole Miss and opened this season as a backup after Austin Simmons was named the Week 1 starter by Lane Kiffin.\n\nMORE: How Trinidad Chambliss went from D2 afterthought to SEC star\n\nThe decision for Chambliss, if his waiver is approved, was believed to be between staying at Ole Miss and transferring to LSU or elsewhere. Now, the NFL could be in play given his impressive College Football Playoff run.\n\nESPN's Mel Kiper ranked Chambliss as his No. 6 quarterback in the 2026 class in mid-December, which might slot him as a mid-round pick in a fairly thin class for the position, but the lack of blue-chip prospects in the class could be why it makes the most sense for the Ole Miss star to turn professional now.\n\nOnce the Rebels' run is over, Chambliss could see his stock elevated closer to the top quarterback prospects in the draft than anyone could have imagined.",

    "fullText": "Behind a historic second-half performance from Trinidad Chambliss and a game-winning 47-yard field goal from Lucas Carneiro, No. 6 Mississippi was able to win a shootout and pull off the come-from-behind victory over No. 3 Georgia in the CFP Sugar Bowl quarterfinal on Thursday, Jan. 1, advancing to the CFP Fiesta Bowl semifinal.\n\nAnd the Rebels did it all without the coach who led them to their first-ever CFP berth in Lane Kiffin.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Georgia vs Ole Miss live updates, Trinidad Chambliss gives Rebels lead in Sugar Bowl\n\nChambliss set a new Sugar Bowl record by completing 13 consecutive passes, which included two ridiculous throws on the run to Kewan Lacey in the fourth quarter, before an incompletion on a batted down pass at the 6:19 mark of the fourth quarter. He finished 30-of-46 passes for 362 yards and two touchdown passes.\n\nThe Rebels' five-point win over the Bulldogs served to be the closest game of the CFP quarterfinals, and the closest game of the 2025-26 College Football Playoff. Next up for the Rebels will be No. 10 Miami in the CFP Fiesta Bowl semifinal on Thursday, Jan. 8 at 7:30 p.m. ET at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nGiven the nature of the upset and the fact Kiffin infamously left the Rebels before their CFP berth, social media didn't hold back when it decided to roast the current Tigers coach, who spent the day watching Kim Mulkey and the LSU women's basketball team get upset by Kentucky.\n\nHere's a snippet of those reactions:\n\nHere's a look at social media after Ole Miss' win over Georgia in the CFP Sugar Bowl quarterfinal:\n\nLegendary performance by Ole Miss.

    "fullText": "Ever since Ruben Amorim took charge, Manchester United have ditched their traditional method of attacking with wingers, instead choosing to employ wingbacks.\n\nAmad, who was signed as a winger, was repurposed to fit this idea, and the Ivorian has made the right wingback position his own.\n\nHowever, it is the opposite flank where the head coach has struggled to find the right fit. Diogo Dalot has been the go-to option, but he is a traditional fullback and has struggled with the attacking part.\n\nPatrick Dorgu was signed from Lecce to play in that position, but he has been hit-or-miss and needs more time.\n\nWith the Red Devils struggling for any real consistency, the Portuguese tactician could do with help in the January window to address this issues.\n\nWhile a midfielder remains the top priority, The Daily Mail have claimed the club have discussed the possibility of adding a wingback to their armoury as well.\n\nIn fact, INEOS are reportedly planning to reunite the former Sporting CP boss with one of his former club’s best academy products in Salvador Blopa.\n\n“United have discussed Sporting Lisbon right wing back Salvador Blopa,” the report claimed.\n\nLabelled the “next Nuno Mendes“, the 18-year-old set tongues wagging after he set an 88-year club record on his debut with the Sporting senior team last season.\n\nHe became the first player for the club to score two goals on his debut since 1937. The academy product can play on either flank and interestingly, his current deal expires in the summer.\n\nSporting have been trying to agree a new long-term deal with the player’s representatives, which will include a mammoth €100 million release clause.\n\nIt is expected to act as a deterrent, but until that is agreed, the 20-time English league champions have the chance to pounce and potentially seal the signature of Salvador Blopa on a free.\n\nFeature image Alex Livesey via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Indiana’s head coach addressed the media after a dominant win over Alabama in the Rose Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Indiana football head coach Curt Cignetti addressed the media following the No. 1-seed Hoosiers’ 38-3 win over No. 9-seed Alabama at the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California.\n\nHere’s what he had to say, courtesy of ASAPSports:\n\nQ. You had mentioned yesterday that you felt like the preparation was really going that great or you were — it would probably bring up concern for people in that situation. What changed from that point to now to where it didn’t look like there was really much of a layoff that you guys were on?\n\nCIGNETTI: Sometimes my messaging is intended for the players to hear to further reinforce my message to them, because preparation’s hard to gauge. Alabama had to do the same thing we did, come out on a Wednesday and then have their first practice on site, and I mean, there is disruption there compared to your normal routine, which we’re all creatures of a routine.\n\nSo I think our guys — we had a great walk-through yesterday. We went to SoFi for that, and that was great for our players, I think, to get there.\n\nI thought our mindset was really good. I liked our prep, for the most part, once we knew who the opponent was. It was a hard-fought game early in the game. Alabama made some plays, they had us off balance offensively, they had a new all-up blitz.\n\nBut we were able to kind of make the plays when we needed to and take it over in the second half. And you know it’s a great win for our football program. I’m proud of our players, our coaches, and everyone. Again, a big win against a team that’s got great tradition like that and history, a lot of good players, and great head football coach.\n\nQ. Felt like another kind of one of those games you’ve had this season where your run game just kind of grounded them down. As the game worn on and you popped explosives in the second half. What does it say about the offense and maybe specifically that ground game, the way it can lean on an opponent as a game wears on and maybe really tire a defense out?\n\nCIGNETTI: I think that’s what you would always love to see as the head coach, things we used to preach when I was at Alabama, about changing the way they think, breaking their will, and that’s the best way to do it, running the football.\n\nIt takes a while. It doesn’t happen in the first quarter, the second quarter, it happens in the second half at some point, hopefully, when you’re able to achieve that goal.\n\nAnd I thought our line did a nice job. I thought our backs really ran hard, and I’m sure there were some nice blocks down field too, but the backs, I was really impressed with how hard they ran.\n\nQ. When your offensive lineman wins the MVP and your Heisman quarterback is grinning from ear to ear, what does that mean to you, and how does that describe the chemistry on this team?\n\nCIGNETTI: Yeah, I think you hit it right on the head. I’m, at this point, probably used to it. Fernando’s a very special guy. He’s very unique. He’s selfless. He’s the ultimate team guy. And then we’ve got some other guys, like Coogan, who is really the same way; he’s the ultimate team guy.\n\nWe’ve got a lot of other guys on the team that played last year, like Fisher, Carter Smith, just to name two. I could name a lot more that are ultimate team guys. I think that’s one of the reasons that we’re so consistent and efficient. We are efficient, is how I would label us, is because we have good players with very high character. They’re great team guys and really good leaders, and they listen and they buy in.\n\nQ. Bryant Haines talks about how you’ve always been the same guy in the way you run your program, the way you operate. What does it mean to you to take the system that you started at the D-II level to this level of college football and have success like you did at that lower level?\n\nCIGNETTI: You know, I learned from my mistakes, one thing about it was I did make a lot of mistakes year one, and then the second time through, you always get a little better, and every year you do. So I can’t say that I’m the same coach I was year one, because I’m not. You’re always looking to improve because you get better or worse; you never stay the same.\n\nThe things they’ve talked about, the constant striving for improvement, I mean, I do try to live that way. You’re either getting better or worse; you’re separating or somebody is gaining on you.\n\nMy journey has been kind of surreal, but I think every move kind of prepared me for this challenge at this time with the changing dynamic of college football.\n\nQ. You’ve been in big games this season. How do you temper a win like this? And what does a win like this teach these young men for life after football?\n\nCIGNETTI: Well, I’m not going to assume anything like we bounce back from a number of big wins and we’ll be fine, because it’s a process. So we’ll have a very big challenge ahead of us next week. It’s very hard to beat a really good football team twice. There’s no doubt about that.\n\nWhat was the last part of your question?\n\nQ. What’s a win like this teach these young men about football and about life?\n\nCIGNETTI: That’s the great thing about football, I think. It’s a great vehicle that helps people, used properly, become more successful in their life’s work later on and raising a family. A lot of great lessons there about teamwork, leadership, overcoming adversity, meeting challenges, preparation, commitment, discipline, work ethic, toughness. We’ve got a lot of the guys that have the right stuff, and I’m proud of them.",

    "fullText": "NEW ORLEANS − Ole Miss football coach Pete Golding and LSU coach Lane Kiffin have continued to cash in on the Rebels' CFP run.\n\nOle Miss (13-1) beat Georgia (12-2) in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 at the Caesars Superdome. Ole Miss won 39-34 in the CFP quarterfinal game.\n\nBoth coaches have contract incentives tied to the Rebels' success.\n\nGolding will be paid $500,000 for the victory. If the Rebels win vs Miami in the Fiesta Bowl in the CFP semifinals, that bonus would increase to $750,000. The biggest bonus Golding could be paid is $1 million, in the event of winning the national championship.\n\nKiffin, who left Ole Miss for LSU on Nov. 30, is getting his former contract bonuses matched by LSU. Like Golding, he has already clinched $250,000 for Ole Miss' win in the first round of the CFP, but that amount could increase.\n\nSam Hutchens covers Ole Miss for the Clarion Ledger.

    "fullText": "Twelve has been trimmed to four as the College Football Playoff heads into the national semifinals with No. 1 seed Indiana set to meet No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl and No. 6 Ole Miss matched with No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nThe Hoosiers mauled No. 9 Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl behind another perfect game from Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, who finished with more touchdown passes, three, than incompletions, two.\n\nThe Rebels dug out of a 21-12 halftime deficit and won 39-34 against No. 3 Georgia, pulling away late with a 47-yard field goal with six seconds left.\n\nOregon smothered No. 4 Texas Tech 23-0 in the Orange Bowl thanks to four turnovers by the Red Raiders, including a key end-zone interception by quarterback Behren Morton in the third quarter.\n\nIn the biggest upset of this year’s tournament, Miami outmuscled No. 2 Ohio State for a 24-14 win in the Cotton Bowl, sending the defending national champions into the offseason on a two-game losing streak.\n\nBefore turning to the next round, here are the biggest winners and losers from the quarterfinals:\n\nThey’re No. 1 in the nation for a reason. But for the doubters and cynics, this destruction of mighty Alabama makes a point that’s impossible to ignore: Indiana’s not just a great story but a potential juggernaut capable of beating the absolute snot out of any team in the tournament. More aggressive than the Tide, more physical, more composed and clearly better prepared, the Hoosiers showed zero rust after a month-long break after the Big Ten championship game. Build a time machine, go back a few years or so, find your younger self and whisper this sentence in your ear: Alabama just lost the Rose Bowl to Indiana by 35 points.\n\nNow 2-0 without Lane Kiffin, the Rebels avenged their one regular-season loss thanks to a brilliant night from senior Trinidad Chambliss, who had 362 yards passing and two touchdowns without an interception. Down 21-12 at halftime, Ole Miss began to take over in the third quarter and then delivered two key scores early in the fourth. Along the way to the game-winning field goal, the Rebels had to deal with several questionable penalty calls (or lack thereof) and needed to regain their composure after Georgia tied the game with a minute to go. That Ole Miss continues to defy the odds really speaks to new coach Pete Golding’s work keeping the team together.\n\nThe image of Oregon as a finesse program persists despite ample evidence to the contrary. The latest example was the Ducks’ shutout in the Orange Bowl, which saw the defense never allow the Red Raiders to come up for air in giving up just 215 yards on 3.5 yards per play. While the running game sputtered and gained just 64 yards, Oregon quarterback Dante Moore hit on 26 of 33 attempts for 234 yards. But the defense did the dirty work in this win, including not just that end-zone pick but a previous strip-sack fumble return earlier in the third quarter that set up the Ducks’ first touchdown.\n\nThe way Miami beat Ohio State matters. Going up against a team many expected to repeat and a defense that ranked first nationally in the major categories, the Hurricanes dictated the tempo and the tone by dominating the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. That was embodied during a five-minute drive late in the fourth quarter that helped Miami bury the Buckeyes. Matchups also matter in the postseason, and Miami might’ve met a friendly opponent in Ohio State’s slower playing style. But there’s no question after the Cotton Bowl that the Hurricanes have the ability to win two more games and the program’s first national championship since 2001.\n\nAlabama hadn’t lost by 30 or more points since 1998. The Crimson Tide were so clearly the inferior team – in talent, coaching, drive, toughness – that the 35-point loss wasn’t surprising, necessarily speaking. But that doesn’t make this any less embarrassing: After fighting back from 17 points down to beat Oklahoma in the opening round, Alabama never even put up a whisper of an argument against the Hoosiers and seemed happy to shut things down early in the second half and look toward next season. This was the program’s seventh loss in two years under coach Kalen DeBoer after dropping nine games across Nick Saban’s final six seasons.\n\nThere’s a question to be asked about how good Ohio State was, really, after losing to Indiana and Miami in its final two games. Yeah, the Buckeyes beat Texas, but that was in the season opener. Their next-best win came against Michigan. The defense was terrific all year but couldn’t get key stops against Miami, especially with the game on the line. The offensive line was great until these past two games, giving up five sacks to both Indiana and Miami after just six in the first 12 games. While plenty of talent is coming back to Columbus, Ohio State has to speed things up offensively after playing too sluggishly this season.\n\nThe Bulldogs seemed on the verge of delivering a knockout blow coming out of the half after a 21-point second quarter. To give back the game at that point underlines Georgia’s unpredictability even during a 12-1 regular season, especially with an offense that was better running the ball than in 2024 but often unable to put teams away. Georgia will be haunted by a great scoring opportunity late in the game, with the Rebels up 34-31: Second-and-goal at the 3-yard line turned into fouth-and-6 and the game-tying field goal instead of the go-ahead score. To not get six points was out of character for a team that came into the Sugar Bowl ranked third in the country with a 79.3% touchdown rate in the red zone.\n\nThe Orange Bowl was a bad look for the Big 12, which joined the ACC in sending just one team into the tournament but had that team ejected right off the bat while Miami has already claimed two playoff wins. The loss also comes after a postseason where Big 12 teams had earned bowl victories against teams from the ACC, SEC and the Big Ten. This still goes down as a banner season for Texas Tech despite the ugly way things ended against Oregon, though it’s clear the Red Raiders will need to reopen the pocketbooks to compile another playoff-worthy roster next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: College Football Playoff winners, losers from quarterfinals",

    "fullText": "Whoever wins the national championship game on Jan. 19 will be breaking a significant national championship drought.\n\nNo. 10 Miami is the most recent national champion of the four teams remaining in the College Football Playoff. The Hurricanes won their last national title after a 2001 season that was capped by a blowout win in the Rose Bowl.\n\nAfter Miami, the next most-recent national champion is No. 6 Ole Miss. The Rebels claim the 1960 national title after a 10-0-1 season that ended with a 14-6 Sugar Bowl win over Rice.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon? Neither team has a national title to its name. And one of them is guaranteed to be playing for the first in school history.\n\nHere’s a quick look at the semifinal matchups on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9.\n\nNo. 6 Ole Miss (13-1) vs. No. 10 Miami (12-2)\n\nJan. 8 | 7:30 p.m. ET | ESPN | Miami -3 | Total: 51.5\n\nThe Hurricanes have opened as the early favorites even though Ole Miss avenged a regular-season loss to Georgia in a 37-34 Sugar Bowl win over the Bulldogs.\n\nMiami took down Texas A&M in the first round and Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl on Wednesday night thanks to a relentless pass rush. Can the Hurricanes pressure Trinidad Chambliss the same way? Chambliss’ escapability was on full display against Georgia, especially in the second half. He showed how great of an improvisor he can be after Georgia’s pass rush flushed him from the pocket.\n\nThe Rebels’ win denied Miami QB Carson Beck the opportunity to play his old team for a shot at the national title. But if the betting line is to be believed, a matchup with Ole Miss gives Miami a better shot at making it to the national title game.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana (14-0) vs. No. 5 Oregon (13-1)\n\nJan. 9 | 7:30 p.m. ET | ESPN | Indiana -4 | Total: 46.5\n\nThe Hoosiers are now the clear national title favorites after a 38-3 Rose Bowl romp over Alabama. Indiana is +130 to win the national title ahead of Oregon and Miami at +300 each and Ole Miss at +600.\n\nThe Ducks shut out Texas Tech 23-0 in the Orange Bowl. It was the third shutout in CFP history and the first in nearly 10 years.\n\nIndiana beat Oregon 30-20 in the regular season. Thanks to Ole Miss’ games against Tulane and Georgia in the first two rounds, the first three rounds in this year’s playoff will have had one rematch.\n\nOregon QB Dante Moore threw two interceptions in the Ducks’ October loss as the Hoosiers held Oregon to 267 yards on 64 plays. Oregon’s win over Texas Tech was impressive but it could also have been a lot bigger. The Ducks’ offense squandered a lot of opportunities after getting into Texas Tech territory.",

The longer Boston waits, the more likely it becomes that another team will swoop in and sign him.\n\nThe Red Sox may not be the frontrunner for Bregman anymore, either, based on Mark Feinsand’s report for MLB.com on Thursday. According to Feinsand, the Arizona Diamondbacks and Toronto Blue Jays “may be the two most aggressive clubs in the hunt for Bregman,” although a reunion with Boston is still possible.\n\nWhere things stand with top 6 @MLB free agents https://t.co/ta8jzvhgDX\n\n— Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) January 2, 2026\n\nFeinsand adds that the Red Sox and Blue Jays are both competing for Bichette as well. Accordingly, the free-agent decisions of Bregman and Bichette are closely related.\n\nIf Bregman returns to Boston, Toronto becomes more likely to re-sign Bichette and vice versa. If Bregman joins the Blue Jays, the Red Sox may counter by signing Bichette.\n\nBoston can be flexible thanks to Marcelo Mayer’s defensive versatility. If Bregman leaves, the Red Sox could put him at third base and sign Bichette to play second base. If Bregman stays, Mayer can man second.\n\nIt depends on which of the two All-Stars signs first, and where. Regardless, it sounds like there’s a high likelihood of them either returning to their teams or switching teams with each other, the latter of which would make things even more interesting in the AL East.\n\nRed Sox Fans Get Concerning Update In Alex Bregman Sweepstakes",

    "fullText": "Georgia vs. Ole Miss end-of-game delay: Explaining chaos in final moments of 2026 Sugar Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ole Miss Rebels are advancing to the College Football Playoff semifinals, but it didn’t come easily.\n\nThe Rebels had to overcome a nine-point halftime deficit, navigate plenty of back-and-forth calls, and contend with a strong performance from Georgia’s offense in the Sugar Bowl. Even after a game-winning field goal, Ole Miss faced added drama in the final seconds.\n\nJust when the game seemed over following a safety on the final kickoff, officials added time to the clock, giving Georgia one last possession after a somewhat lengthy delay. Ole Miss held on for a 39-34 victory.\n\nHere’s a look at the chaotic final moments of the Sugar Bowl.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Trinidad Chambliss' huge game vs. Georgia\n\nThe biggest play of the night for Ole Miss was a field goal from Lucas Carneiro with six seconds remaining in regulation after Georgia had come back to tie it at 34. With the 48-yard field goal, Ole Miss reclaimed the lead and put a ton of pressure on the Bulldogs to make some magic happen in the final moments of their season.\n\nOLE MISS MAKES THE KICK WITH SIX SECONDS REMAINING 😱 pic.twitter.com/fJC66nZ8Al\n\nOn the following kickoff, Georgia's Landon Roldan returned the kick out of the end zone, but he then turned to throw the ball back behind him. But nobody else was there, partially due to one of his teammates falling to the ground, allowing the ball to bounce all the way to the other sideline and out of bounds.\n\nInitially, it appeared that the game was over from time expiring, and Ole Miss received an extra two points from the safety.\n\nRegardless, both teams emptied onto the field as if the game was over, stages were brought onto the field and Ole Miss was celebrating.\n\nOLE MISS WINS!\n\nHere's the go-ahead field goal and ensuing kickoff that resulted in a safety.\n\nSean McDonough on the call for ESPN. 🏈🔥🎙️ #CFPhttps://t.co/DHgVt8xsAWpic.twitter.com/qA3qFgoQIO\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) January 2, 2026\n\nHowever, it became clear that the officials weren't completely satisfied with the game's conclusion. On the kickoff play, there was ruled to be one second still remaining, meaning the Bulldogs had to go out for a free kick.\n\nAfter players made their way back onto the field, Georgia then recovered its free kick, so no time was taken off the clock. That meant the Bulldogs then got an opportunity for one more play with a second remaining, lining up for a ton of pitches and anything they could muster up with no time left.\n\nAfter plenty of laterals, Ole Miss finally ended it for good by tackling Gunner Stockton. Minutes after appearing to already win the game, including a Gatorade bath for head coach Pete Golding, the Rebels officially got the win.\n\nThe saga included entire stages being pushed on and back off the field:\n\nAnd here's the *official* ending after a bit of chaos.\n\nSean McDonough: \"Matt, this is feeling like an excruciating ending to a classic game. Does common sense need to prevail here?\"\n\nMatt Austin: \"Well, yes, but we do have rules we have to follow.\" 🏈🦓🎙️ #CFPhttps://t.co/UZIoeWwxK8pic.twitter.com/Puh9ym6fsT\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) January 2, 2026",

The Bulldogs’ postseason experience, defensive strength and a regular season win in Athens weighed on many minds.\n\nThat confidence did not survive Thursday night in New Orleans.\n\nOle Miss stunned third-ranked Georgia 39-34 in a chaotic College Football Playoff quarterfinal that featured 30 combined fourth quarter points, multiple lead changes and one of the most unusual endings in bowl history.

Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss carved up the Bulldogs for 362 yards and two touchdowns, repeatedly answering Georgia rallies with poise and precision. His 40-yard strike to De’Zhaun Stribling on third down late in the fourth quarter set up Lucas Carneiro’s decisive 47-yard field goal with six seconds remaining.\n\nCarneiro was flawless all night, drilling three field goals, including Sugar Bowl-record kicks of 55 and 56 yards as Ole Miss totaled 473 yards of offense. Georgia finished with 355 yards but couldn’t come up with the final stop when it mattered.\n\nGeorgia had erased a 10-point deficit in the final minutes, tying the game on Peyton Woodring’s field goal with 55 seconds left. That rally only heightened the drama before Ole Miss delivered the final blow.\n\nIt was the kind of result that shows why the games are played on the field.

    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics continued their longest road trip of the season on Thursday night, heading to Sacramento for their third of four games on the West Coast. Taking on a Kings team that has struggled mightily all season, the Celtics could not find their rhythm early, dropping a first quarter contest for the fifth straight game, but were able to right the ship when it was most needed.\n\nThe matchup was tightly contested through the first three quarters, and even with the Kings playing much improved on the night, Boston pulled away thanks to their superstars stepping up in the fourth quarter. Derrick White struggled from the field for most of the game, but all starters except Jordan Walsh finished in double figures, with 7 Celtics total ending the game with double digit point totals.\n\nHere's a quick recap of the Celtics 14-point victory over the Kings on Thursday:\n\nFourth quarter: Outscoring the Kings by 14 points in the final quarter, that was exactly what Boston needed to carry them to the victory. Derrick White struggled for most of the game, but put up 14 of his 16 total points in the fourth, coming up clutch with his two made 3-pointers in that time as well.\n\nBench contribution: Sam Hauser, Luka Garza, Anfernee Simons, and Hugo Gonzalez all showed up and performed well off the bench for Boston on Thursday night. As a unit, the bench scored 46 points, showing great balance from them and the starters. Sacramento had two big contributions off their bench from Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis who combined for 34 points, but Boston's bench unit did a little bit of everything to fill up the stat sheet.\n\nPaint domination: In filling up the stat sheet, the Celtics outrebounded the Kings 40-32, and continued their control down low by putting up 50 points in the paint. Not only did Boston outrebound Sacramento, but they outscored them by 10 points in the paint, which was influenced by Neemias Queta who faced off against his former team that cut him.\n\nWOAHHH OK NEEMI 😤 pic.twitter.com/PEP743Tgxa\n\n— Boston Celtics (@celtics) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Celtics will close out their West coast road trip on Saturday, while finishing off their two-game series against the Los Angeles Clippers. In their first matchup Boston pulled out a 121-118 victory which saw Jaylen Brown and Payton Pritchard combine for 63 points back in November. The Clippers have been one of the hottest teams in the NBA over the past two weeks, winning five straight games although they're still 10 games under .500 on the season. Los Angeles is still led by Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, and Ivica Zubac who is averaging 15 points and 11 rebounds on the year. Despite their poor record, the Clippers should bring a challenge to Boston which has struggled to get off to a good starts during the road trip.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: Celtics use big fourth quarter to close out Kings in 14-point win",

Boston is now 21-12 on the season, maintaining their spot as the third-best team in the Eastern Conference.\n\nFollowing Thursday’s NBA slate, the Celtics are 3.5 games back of the first-place Detroit Pistons and two games back of the second-place New York Knicks.\n\nBrown added 10 rebounds and four assists to his box score versus the Kings. The MVP candidate is now averaging 29.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 5.0 assists per game in 31 games played this season. He’s shooting 50.3 percent from the field.\n\nJaylen Brown this season\n(31 games played)\n\n29.5 PPG (50.3% FG)\n6.4 RPG\n5.0 APG pic.twitter.com/8oLbDVipYf\n\n— Celtics City (21-12) (@celticscity_) January 2, 2026\n\nBrown actually fouled out of this game late in the fourth quarter on a controversial call that Joe Mazzulla challenged. The game was already in hand at that point. It wasn’t the most efficient game for Brown (11-25 FG), but there was no one on the Kings who could stop JB whenever he felt like driving to the cup.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Brown decided to merely put his head down and use his athleticism on a straight line to the rim; no fancy moves needed. One such example occurred at the end of the first half, when Brown used a basic between-the-legs dribble to advance past the older DeMar DeRozan for a left-handed finish.\n\nJaylen to end the half.

Sam Hauser scored 15 off the bench on an efficient 5-of-7 from 3. Anfernee Simons was similarly effective, tallying 14 off the pine (4-of-7 from distance).\n\nThe Celtics out-rebounded the Kings, 40-32. Sacramento was sharp from the line (14-15 FT) but merely room temperature from downtown (33 percent), mostly due to Russell Westbrook (2-for-9) and Dennis Schröder (3-for-8) combining for 12 long-distance bricks.\n\nNext up for the Celtics is a Saturday night showdown with the Clippers in Los Angeles. The Clips have been playing well of late and Kawhi Leonard looks rejuvenated. It’ll be a nice test for Boston.\n\nJoe Mazzulla Explains What Luka Garza Is Doing to Earn Minutes In Celtics Rotation",

There’s a lot of people who do playoffs, and I feel like the playoffs have looked a certain way for a long time, and we’re trying to serve two purposes here.”\n\nWhether Lanning's comments will continue to draw traction remains unclear, but what is clear is that the CFP may have work to do to satisfy everyone moving forward.",

    "fullText": "Trinidad Chambliss and Ole Miss are now the biggest story in college football after an upset of No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl to advance to the College Football Playoff semifinals.\n\nThe No. 6 Rebels (13-1) overcame a 21-12 halftime deficit with some unbelievable play from Chambliss and a clutch field goal from Lucas Carneiro in the final seconds of the game to win, 39-34. Chambliss went 30/46 passing for 362 yards and two touchdowns as the Rebels used a 20-10 margin in the fourth quarter to put the game on ice.\n\nThis is not a game Georgia (12-2) loses entering the fourth quarter with a lead. In fact, it was the first game in 76 tries that a team defeated the Bulldogs when it had the lead going into the fourth quarter. SEVENTY SIX FOLKS THATS SPECIAL.\n\nThere will probably be some children conceived in Mississippi tonight who will be named Lucas. The sophomore placekicker Carneiro converted a 47-yard field goal with six seconds remaining to make it 37-34, but he set the Sugar Bowl record for longest field goal twice in the first quarter with a 55-yard kick then a 56-yarder shortly after to set and reset the record.\n\nThe Ole Miss defense held Georgia to 343 offensive yards including 124 rushing yards at only a 3.4 yards per attempt average. This is one of the big differences from the first version of this game with the defense stalling Georgia when it mattered most and holding Gunnar Stockton to just over 200 yards passing.\n\nKewan Lacy led all rushers for the Rebels with 98 yards and two touchdowns. Lacy had what seemed to be a gamechanging fumble in the first half that was returned for a Georgia touchdown, but the sophomore RB just seemed to get stronger as the game went on. The determination of this team and the mental toughness shone through the most mounting a comeback against one of the most talented teams in the country.\n\nFrom the wide receiver room, Trey Wallace led the way with nine catches for 156 yards and a touchdown. De’Zhaun Stribling also flexed on the shorthanded Bulldog secondary with seven catches for 122 yards.\n\nTruly, this Thursday night was one of the biggest wins in Ole Miss football history. A seventh Sugar Bowl championship second best all time for the Rebels is just some additional icing on the cake.\n\nIt’s now one week until a showdown with No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Ariz.

    "fullText": "Mayenda was absolutely phenomenal, playing like a player who wants to prove a point and play more minutes in the best league in the world.\n\nBig, strong, fast, fleet-footed and wonderful. I’ll have his start every game for the rest of his life.\n\nHe’s gone from “He’s finished, he doesn’t need a contract” to prime Roberto Carlos in a game!\n\nI take back the lack of faith from the Leeds match. I’m sorry.\n\nThis is tough, so I’m going to go for people selling their tickets to City fans in the concourse.\n\nWhy would you do this? There were so many there. You’re mental!\n\nLess of this coldness — I’m already dying of a chest infection.\n\nI must admit to having a bit of trepidation before the game but the atmosphere at the start and the way we went toe to toe with City was uplifting and very encouraging.\n\nEveryone was up for it — hard work and no little skill. What a battling point. Superb!\n\nEveryone deserves a mention but my man of the match was Alderete.\n\nHe fought for every ball and put his body on the line. Unbelievable!\n\nI lost count of the number of times they killed the atmosphere and flow of the game by going down and feigning injury.\n\nI wish referees would see this for what it is: cheating — or bring in the rugby rule where trainers can come on the pitch but allow play to continue.\n\nNot perfect, but it would be a start in tackling this gamesmanship.\n\nMy neutral friend at the match said he was the most inconsistent he’d seen.\n\nMy mate is a Bolton fan and despite what we think, he said the standard in League One is better than we saw last night.\n\nThankfully, it didn’t spoil a great performance.\n\nManchester City were on a run of eight victories coming into this fixture — and one of those was against us at the Etihad Stadium, so we know what this opponent is capable of.\n\nNone of the home players could be faulted. The defence and midfield were outstanding whilst we restricted City to just four shots on target.\n\nWe’ve gone ten Premier League games without defeat at home and this outstanding point was gained with seven players out — six at AFCON and Dan Ballard, who also missed out against Leeds United.\n\nMany have remarked on how this team likes to defend, and we’ve earned seven clean sheets so far — including three on our travels.\n\nErling Haaland was very effectively shackled by Nordi Mukiele but we also chose players with attacking intent, with Eliezer Mayenda, Brian Brobbey and Simon Adingra starting. We also had four shots on target then brought on Wilson Isidor and Romaine Mundle later in the game.\n\nBearing in mind that just over a year ago, we lost at Stoke City, the plan has been executed to perfection, with great recruitment. We’re now an established Premier League side.\n\nAs mentioned, it is very hard to fault any of the players but I felt that at crucial moments we lacked coolness and calm in front of goal — especially the chances for Brobbey, Mundle and Adingra.\n\nThis argues for some attacking recruitment in the winter transfer window; I still feel we need a wily “fox in the box” who can hit the back of the net but can also pass on his experience to the younger strikers.\n\nIt would be unconstructive to try to pick any other faults after another outstanding home performance, but there’s been a huge turnover of players in the past year and over the next couple of weeks, we may see some more players who were crucial to our progress in that period departing.\n\nIt could be “farewell” to Dan Neil, Aji Alese and others — adding to Patrick Roberts, Jobe and Tommy Watson.\n\nClearing the decks and balancing the books is very important in business terms.\n\nThat was one of the most gritty points we’ll get this season and from one to eleven (plus our substitutes) the Lads were all massive.\n\nThe defence faced up to everything that was thrown at them and got a well-deserved share of the points.\n\nA special mention for Nordi Mukiele, who showed how to outmuscle Erling Haaland. He was my man of the match, but there were a lot of contenders.\n\nI was chuffed for Mayenda as he’s made a great claim for a continued run on the right — during the AFCON period and maybe beyond.\n\nHis pace, aggression and ability to run at defenders with the ball gave us extra options and to hear his song chanted time and again was fantastic.\n\nHopefully he has his confidence back and can really contribute.\n\nThe chances we created have been converted in other games and to miss the chance to nick a narrow win against City leaves me with a similar feeling to the Liverpool away game.\n\nA point is great though — so we take it and move on.\n\nThe decisions made by the man in black left a lot to be desired but that’s a common occurrence.\n\nI honestly thought we’d get better officials at this level but it seems they perform poorly at all levels.\n\nIt didn’t ruin the game but it didn’t help us. Better luck next time, hopefully!\n\nHands up everyone who thought our unbeaten home record would fall?\n\nI’ll admit I was one, not only because after the Leeds game I thought we were missing Dan Ballard, Reinildo and Noah Sadiki — which isn’t a slight on the players who’ve come in — but also because we were up against the dominant force in the Premier League over the last ten to fifteen years, and a team who after a shaky time last season have looked more like their old selves in the past couple of months.\n\nWe’ve seen off Arsenal at home; we’ve seen off “the visitors” and now we’ve seen off the machine that is Manchester City. Who else is out there?\n\nI think he has a lot in his locker for a young striker and last season in the Championship, he worked hard after a bright opening to the campaign, a bit of a indifferent period after injury and then came on strong in the second half of the year to play a significant part in our promotion.\n\nAs we went into this season, I felt that if there was one player in our ranks from the Championship squad who could make an impact in the Premier League, it was him.\n\nI think he’s been a bit unlucky not to get more chances so far with the form of Wilson Isidor and Brian Brobbey, but we looked more balanced and carried more of an attacking threat with him in our ranks.\n\nI hope he keeps his place and gets a run in the side, as he has more to offer.\n\nThis match summed up why we are were we are and not fighting a relegation battle.\n\nUnlimited commitment from everyone in a red and white shirt and in the last half hour with City piling forward, we were throwing bodies from all angles in front of the ball.But it wasn’t all about the Blues and we opened up enough chances to have got a goal ourselves.\n\nCity know they got a game from us — and there’ll be top teams in the Premier League who won’t give City as much as a test as we did.\n\nI have no real downs to report and considering how I dreaded it might have turned out you have to be happy with the point, and it wasn’t a lucky point at that.\n\nIt was fully deserved from our view, we are still unbeaten at home going into the New Year and we now have twenty nine points from nineteen games and sit in seventh place halfway through the season.",

    "description": "John a Wilson feels that now is the time for Sunderland AFC to reaffirm its links with its Durham heartlands!",
    "fullText": "Before I moved away from the North East nearly a quarter of a century ago, one of my favourite places to wander around was Durham, with its beautiful cobbled streets, the castle and cathedral.\n\nIn fact, the view from the bridge over the River Wear, with the castle towering on the east bank, is one of the most picturesque and loved scenes in the country (according to a TV programme from the 1990’s) competing with Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh, various Lake District scenes and St. Michael’s Mount and Tintagel in Cornwall.\n\nBrought up in North Shields and having gone to school in Newcastle’s West End, I was used to being surrounded by Mag fans, but unlike other stories I’ve heard about school life, there was never — to my knowledge — violence linked to the team you supported.\n\nNevertheless, as you can imagine, I got more than enough ear-bashing and taunting from Newcastle supporters, yet there was some solace to be found in my old school’s slogan, which began: “By the banks of the silvery Wear, ‘neath proud Durham’s towered shrine”, which referred to the burial place of St. Cuthbert — the school I attended.\n\nIt was always nice to get away from Newcastle City or North Shields, where it would’ve been careless to wear any Sunderland colours or sport the badge on a hat. Durham always felt safe. I was on home territory — County Durham and Wearside.\n\nHistorically, Sunderland was part of County Durham.\n\nThe old county borough was abolished in 1974, with the formation of the new “Metropolitan County of Tyne and Wear”. The Durham coalfields had strong ties to Sunderland AFC and the Durham Miners’ Association recognises their shared heritage.\n\nSunderland is often seen as a “Durham Miners’ Club” and for people in County Durham — certainly when I was growing up and before my exile from the North East — supporting Sunderland was often the default choice. Whilst some areas leaned towards Newcastle United, it’s fair to say that Durham generally favoured supporting the Lads.\n\nI’m not sure when the phrase “Durham Mag” became a thing, as it certainly sounds like an oxymoron and it wasn’t a phrase that was coined before the turn of the century.\n\nSome people claim it emerged during the Kevin Keegan years as the visitors experienced a surge in success and media attention which resulted in many younger people in neighbouring County Durham becoming Mag fans. Sunderland’s fall from grace over the last ten years didn’t help, as youngsters — for the most part — want to support a successful or at least a Premier League side.\n\nThis whole topic came to the fore after the recent Leeds match, when I decided to stay in Durham after the game.\n\nAt check in, the lady at the desk asked if I’d travelled far. I told her I’d driven up from Worcestershire but that I’d only just come from the Sunderland game. She gave me a stern sideways look and jokingly said, “Oh, you support them, do you? Boo!”\n\nI was quite taken aback and informed her that when I used to live locally, most of Durham was red and white — we were, after all, on the banks of the Wear.\n\nShe retorted that “These days, it’s about half-and-half in the area of Sunderland fans and Mags”.\n\nI’m not an expert as I never actually lived in County Durham, but some references I’ve seen suggest that it used to be 80% to 20% in favour of supporting the Black Cats, whereas now, it’s nearer to 50/50. But no wonder the term “Durham Mags” has such a negative connotation — it’s used pejoratively to imply that these supporters are “plastic fans” or “glory hunters” who lack a genuine local or heritage connection with Newcastle.\n\nHopefully this season is the start of the fightback and a marker for when school children will want to start supporting the red and whites — the dominant team in the North East, derby victors, and a team going places.\n\nA team that isn’t aligned to dodgy Arab owners, that cares about the community, and has a long-term plan and identity in place.\n\nHappy New Year, and haway me bonnie lads!",

    "description": "Ben McKevitt looks at the main stories from Sunderland’s entertaining New Year’s Day draw with Pep Guardiola’s side!",
    "fullText": "Cirkin’s future at the club has been up for significant debate during the last six months and beyond, with his ability to step up to Premier League level consistently questioned in his absence.\n\nHe’s been thrown in at the deep end to start his Premier League career, and a hot-and-cold performance against Leeds led to a lot of scrutiny, but I think it’s clear that Cirkin can definitely hold his own at this level.\n\nHe was composed, sharp, progressive and incisive down the left, defending valiantly throughout and rarely making an error. It felt like City were targeting the right hand side of our defence — which was unsurprising considering how well Cirkin locked down the left channel.\n\nHis injuries came at a terrible time and he was unfortunate to have to wait this long for his chance, but he’s certainly impressing. It was the performance of a player who can hold his own at this level and whilst I don’t think he’ll displace Reinildo, he can be a more than worthy deputy in this league.\n\nEach week, it’s becoming clear just how much Brobbey brings to the side when he leads the line.\n\nHe provides an incredible outlet when under the cosh — especially when facing teams like City who largely dominate possession and heap on the pressure. He gave City’s defenders an absolute nightmare yesterday, consistently holding the ball up and bringing others into play as we aimed to get an opener.\n\nHowever, it’s not just the hold-up play, as he has the pace and power to drive in behind a defence.\n\nA huge opportunity came after he demonstrated unbelievable strength to run off Ruben Dias and going through against Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nUnfortunately, Brobbey couldn’t convert his chance and the game continued at 0-0. I’d love to see him convert more of these chances as they’re opportunities you’d hope your striker would score, but thankfully he contributes massively to the team without the goals.\n\nI think Brobbey’s ability is especially pronounced when he’s replaced by Wilson Isidor, who provides less strength and hold-up prowess in the latter stages.\n\nWhile we often naturally fall back into a more defensive shape towards the end of games, I feel Brobbey’s absence contributes to the gradual move backwards and Isidor just can’t replicate his impact at the moment.\n\nSunderland’s opportunities largely came in a lively first half in which the Lads pushed City to the absolute limit with a fantastic team performance.\n\nBrobbey’s massive chance was well manufactured but poorly executed in the end, and Simon Adingra’s erratic style led to a big opportunity to strike on goal going astray, eventually leading to a sloppy Trai Hume strike which sailed over the bar.\n\nIt was Hume who soon found himself in a position of huge promise after Granit Xhaka placed a wonderful cross right onto his head at the penalty spot and whilst he attempted a glancing effort at goal, he couldn’t manage to use the pace of the ball to guide it on target.\n\nAs the game developed, Mayenda had a great chance of his own to get a strike on goal after a characteristically wonderful pick-out by Enzo Le Fée, which the Spaniard couldn’t quite get under control.\n\nFrom here, City began to ramp up the pressure and create opportunities of their own. Savinho, Erling Haaland and Joškl Gvardiol all came close to breaking through — and could’ve done on another day — but a combination of fine goalkeeping from Robin Roefs and a mammoth effort from the Lads managed to keep them out.\n\nThe chances we carved out are a great sign that we can go toe to toe with one of the best teams in the world and push them to their limit. The game could’ve gone either way on the basis of the chances, and it’s good to see Le Fée getting time and space in the middle to improve our creativity.\n\nHe’s a magician in those areas and is somehow doing his own job of creating and inventing while replacing the running of the absent Sadiki — amazing work again from the Frenchman.\n\nIt was great to see Mayenda back in the starting lineup.\n\nIt was an unorthodox shape at times but Mayenda showed that he has the ability to form a good relationship in a two with Brobbey or to provide that creative spark from the right. His play can be a tad erratic but I think that helps him to be unpredictable and dangerous when facing up against defenders.\n\nOur chance creation throughout the season has been our weakest aspect and players who can provide a spark are priceless in this division. We’ve said it from the start of the season — he has all the attributes to succeed at this level and he just needs the chance to grow into it.\n\nI’d love to see him continue getting chances to impress, and I think we’d benefit from it.\n\nAnother Le Bris masterclass, then.\n\nI feel like he’s somehow still underappreciated across the wider media landscape at the moment — perhaps due to his own quiet nature. However, he’s orchestrating some of the best football we’ve ever experienced at the Stadium of Light and it can’t keep going unnoticed. The players and the setup at the club are brilliant, but Le Bris brings it all together and stands at the core of everything we do.\n\nThe system that Le Bris set up yesterday felt ever-changing and difficult to fully nail down to a formation, regardless of whether we were in or out of possession.\n\nHowever, he’d clearly done his homework as it allowed us to exploit weaknesses in behind City’s backline numerous times across the ninety while retaining good levels of control on the game, and I wasn’t surprised to see that he was disappointed that we couldn’t take all three points.\n\nIt’s half way through our first season back, we’re seventh in the league and disappointed not to be beating Manchester City. Incredible stuff.\n\nThe entire defensive unit was incredible. It’s a sentiment which could likely be duplicated across most performances this season but yesterday was up there with the best.\n\nOmar Alderete and Nordi Mukiele were unbelievable and Erling Haaland may not have a more difficult game this season — he was marshalled out of the game, with just a single opportunity on his weaker foot throughout.\n\nWatching the two of them take turns in just going through everything in their way to clear their lines was spectacular, and Alderete’s tidy feet often provided some great openings to counter.\n\nHaving Roefs to rely on must be a dream for a defender and he gave another key performance between the sticks. Instinctive saves and intelligence when playing out from the back allowed us to stay in the game and build into attacks effectively. His influence is priceless and amazing at such a young age.\n\nIt must be reiterated that we’re without several key performers at the back — including Dan Ballard and Reinildo.\n\nIt’s an unbelievable feat which has allowed us to earn our tenth consecutive unbeaten game at home. We keep rolling on.",

    "fullText": "The mercury reading might’ve plummeted to well below zero by the time the Lads and the Etihad aristocrats kicked off on New Year’s Day, but after ninety-plus minutes of fast, furious and fascinating football, the Stadium Of Light had warmed up nicely — even as 40,000+ headed for the exits and into the icy grip of a winter Wearside night.\n\nThe outcome? 0-0. The conclusion? Sunderland can play. We can mix it. We can stand firm and we can deliver results from seemingly improbable situations.\n\nStripped of our AFCON contingent and the injured Dan Ballard, the smart money might’ve been on a routine victory for Pep Guardiola’s ever-evolving and ruthlessly slick footballing machine.\n\nHowever, I don’t think Régis Le Bris nor his players believe in the “smart money” theory — just as legendary Australian batsman Don Bradman claimed he didn’t believe in the law of averages — and as Sunderland’s reshuffled side held firm to deny the visitors a victory (perhaps throwing a spanner into their title works in the process) how could you not feel a sense of overwhelming pride at this side’s development, ability and commitment to the cause?\n\nMy goodness, this really is a team to be proud of.\n\nIt’s a group of players blessed with a unique mixture of skill and steel; of physicality and growing football intelligence, and under the watchful eye of Le Bris, we’re adding real value to the league, standing firm in the face of any and all challenges — and on this occasion, defending our unbeaten home record with incredible ferocity.\n\nAfter such a superb team display, I could throw some names into the mix and appraise them duly, so I shall.\n\nDennis Cirkin? Outstanding. The victim of some frankly disgraceful criticism in some quarters, the left back handled the occasion and the opposition superbly, showing composure, positional awareness and no lack of attacking instinct. This was exactly the kind of performance he would’ve hoped for, and Reinildo’s absence may be less worrisome as a result.\n\nRobin Roefs? Colosssal. He’s just that good. Simon Adingra? Unbelievably industrious. Brian Brobbey? A handful all evening. Eliezer Mayenda? A real livewire. He played like a man with a point to prove and added some fresh impetus to the red and white attack.\n\nOn and on it could go, because each of the lads in red and white did themselves proud on Thursday evening.\n\nSimply put, they weren’t content to shut up shop and hope for a City off-night. Instead, they took the game to the visitors, made life tough for them and could’ve easily emerged as victors had some of the outstanding chances we created been converted.\n\nCity captain Bernardo Silva has form for lamenting occasions on which opposing teams don’t roll over, sit back and allow his side to dominate — so what would he have felt in the aftermath of this outstanding Sunderland display?\n\nSometimes, it’s just not your night.\n\nAn early City goal being ruled out for offside might not have seemed alarming for Guardiola and his men, but as the game unfolded and Sunderland probed, pressed and chased without mercy, it became clear that this wasn’t going to be the walkover that many — including this writer — feared.\n\nErling Haaland simply wasn’t able to influence proceedings; Phil Foden was relatively quiet and in the City goal, I didn’t think Gianluigi Donnarumma was the tower of strength and composure that Ederson used to be, either.\n\nIn contrast, the Lads were steadfast in their refusal to be breached.\n\nEven without Ballard, the central defensive partnership of Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete was immense and there was no lack of aggression in midfield, either. If this is the kind of result a team affected by absences can achieve, what’s possible with some January reinforcements and the return of the lads currently representing their countries in Morocco?\n\nIn the context of our season, this felt like a huge bonus for Sunderland; the sort of point you grab with both hands, add to the total and reflect on a job very well done.\n\nWhen Arsenal visited Wearside earlier in the season, we gave them a bit of a shock by rallying from 1-2 down to draw 2-2. To me, this felt even more significant — another outstanding display against a world class outfit from a side that you simply can’t fail to love.\n\nIn victory, the players conduct themselves as winners should.\n\nIn defeat, there’s a calm period of reflection and when we shook hands with our opponent after sharing the points on New Year’s Day, we could allow ourselves a moment to digest the fact that we blunted one of English football’s finest teams and ensured that we kicked off 2026 on another hugely positive note.\n\nThat’s something to which we can all raise a glass.\n\nSunderland: Roefs, Hume, Mukiele; Alderete, Cirkin, Geertruida; Xhaka, Mayenda, Le Fée; Adingra (Mundle 72’), Brobbey (Isidor 58’)\n\nSubs Not Used: Patterson, Hjelde, O’Nien, Jones, Rigg, Neil, Tutierov\n\nManchester City: Donnarumma, Nunes, Dias; Ake, O’Reilly (Gvardiol 57’), Bernardo Silva (Reijnders 85’); González (Rodri 46’), Foden, Cherki; Savinho (Doku 51’), Haaland\n\nSubs Not Used: Trafford, Heskey, Khusanov, Mukasa, Lewis",

    "fullText": "A game as good as the Sugar Bowl between Ole Miss and Georgia had to have a wild ending. It ended up having three of them.\n\nIn one of the more confusing endings to a football game you will ever see, Ole Miss twice celebrated what it thought was the final play of a breakthrough win in the College Football Playoff, only to be told the game hadn’t ended.\n\nIn both cases, the crew working the stage for the trophy ceremony had already moved it onto the field, then had to awkwardly remove it as the game played on.\n\nThe refs REALLY drew this one out 😭 pic.twitter.com/oDdgVjvjLg\n\n— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) January 2, 2026\n\nThe sequence of events worked out like this.\n\nAfter a frantic drive that saw Ole Miss reach the Georgia 30-yard line in less than a minute, Ole Miss kicker Lucas Carneiro broke a 34-34 tie with a 47-yard field goal. That appeared to be the game-winner, but six seconds were still left on the clock, so Ole Miss had to kick the ball back to Georgia, opening the door for a miracle for the Bulldogs.\n\nInstead, an attempt at a cross-field lateral resulted in the ball bouncing out of bounds, but not without first hitting the pylon. That made it a safety for Ole Miss, putting the Rebels up five points with one second left. Ole Miss had already been celebrating the win, with quarterback Trinidad Chambliss hugging teammates and several non-players and coaches already running onto the field.\n\nThe officials restored order and had Georgia make its free kick, which went 10 yards and then was recovered by Bulldogs running back Cash Jones. However, Ole Miss thought that the final second of the game had still passed and celebrated accordingly, giving head coach Pete Golding a Gatorade bath as the ESPN announcers pronounced the game over.\n\nNope. The officials ruled there was still one second left on the clock … and Georgia had the ball at its own 31-yard line. ESPN announcer Sean McDonough said the ending felt “excruciating” and asked rules expert Matt Austin, “Does common sense need to prevail here?”\n\nAustin’s response. \"Well, yes, but we do have rules we have to follow.”\n\nAnd so Georgia got its last play, completing one forward pass and nine laterals before quarterback Gunner Stockton was slammed to the ground, 80 yards short of the end zone. The game was over, for real this time.\n\nYou can watch the whole thing play out below:\n\nThe official play-by-play of that final desperation play:\n\nSTOCKTON, Gunner pass short to the left complete for 4 yards to YOUNG, Colbie caught at the UGA35 and advanced to the UGA35 lateral to JONES, Cash for 1 yard to the UGA36 lateral to LUCKIE, Lawson for -3 yards to the UGA33 lateral to JONES, Cash for 5 yards to the UGA38 lateral to YOUNG, Colbie for -7 yards to the UGA31 lateral to YOUNG, Colbie for -5 yards to the UGA26 lateral to LUCKIE, Lawson for 7 yards to the UGA33 lateral to JONES, Cash for 13 yards to the UGA46 lateral to YOUNG, Colbie for -14 yards to the UGA32 lateral to LUCKIE, Lawson for 0 yards to the UGA32 lateral to BELL, Dillon for -11 yards to the UGA21 lateral to MADDOX, Adrian for -2 yards to the UGA19 (PERKINS, Suntarine;JONES, Andrew), clock 00:00.\n\nThis could have become even more chaotic, but the end result was what everyone expected after Carneiro made his kick. Ole Miss will advance to the semifinal of the College Football Playoff and face Miami. Georgia’s season is over. Rebels head coach Pete Golding is $500,000 richer. So is former head coach Lane Kiffin.\n\nAnd we saw firsthand just how far officials will go to end a game by the book.",

    "fullText": "Modern software systems understand what users do, but not how users feel or function.\n\nClicks, taps, ratings, and text inputs have become the dominant form of “human feedback.” These signals are explicit, sparse, and often arrive too late to be useful. Meanwhile, humans continuously emit rich physiological and behavioral signals that reveal stress, focus, fatigue, calm, and engagement — signals that today’s systems largely ignore.\n\nToday, we’re introducing Synheart — a privacy-preserving Human State Interface (HSI) infrastructure that enables modern systems to understand human state in real time, ethically, locally, and through standardized representations.\n\nMost human–computer interaction systems rely on:\n\nYet human state is always present.\n\nStress, focus, emotional load, and behavioral patterns continuously influence decision-making and performance — but modern systems have no native way to perceive or represent them.\n\nSynheart introduces a new primitive for computing systems: human state.\n\nInstead of collecting raw biosignals or subjective feedback, Synheart transforms physiological signals (such as heart-rate-derived features) and digital behavior into structured, machine-readable human state outputs.\n\nThese outputs describe what the human system is doing internally — not just what the user clicks.\n\nHuman state becomes a first-class signal, alongside time, location, and interaction.\n\nAt the core of Synheart is the Human State Interface (HSI).\n\nHSI is a foundational interface standard for representing and exchanging human state across independent systems — similar in role to GPS coordinates or HTTP responses.\n\nHSI does not transmit raw biosignals.\n\nIt represents interpreted human state in a safe, structured form.\n\nThis allows systems to reason about human state without ever accessing sensitive biometric data.\n\nSynheart is built with privacy as a non-negotiable constraint.\n\nUsers retain control. Developers get insight. Systems remain ethical.\n\nTo support a diverse wearable ecosystem, we’ve introduced Synheart Wear a while ago.\n\nSynheart Wear is a vendor-agnostic library that reads biosignals from consumer wearables and normalizes them into a unified signal layer.\n\nIt abstracts away hardware differences so developers and researchers can focus on human state, not device-specific integrations.\n\nTo complement physiological signals, Synheart includes Synheart Behavior — a cross-platform SDK for capturing and transforming digital interaction patterns into structured behavioral signals.\n\nSynheart Behavior models how users interact with digital systems — such as timing, rhythm, switching, and interaction fragmentation — and converts these patterns into numerical behavioral features, without accessing content, text, or personal data.\n\nThe SDK abstracts application- and platform-specific interactions into a unified behavioral signal layer, allowing developers and researchers to reason about human behavior, not interface details.\n\nThese behavioral signals power downstream systems such as:\n\nImportant: Synheart Behavior analyzes interaction dynamics, not what users type, read, or see.\n\nNo content inspection. No surveillance. Privacy by design.\n\nDevelopers can install Synheart Core SDKs directly on device and build applications that adapt to human state in real time.\n\nSynheart is also a research platform.\n\nAll specifications, schemas, and whitepapers are publicly available from day one.\n\nWe believe human-state-aware computing must be built in the open.\n\nOur goal is not a single product, but an ecosystem where:\n\nWe’re working toward a future where human state is a first-class signal in computing.\n\nHuman-state-aware systems begin here.",

    "fullText": "洪 民憙 (Hong Minhee) @hongminhee@hackers.pub\n\nI recently added sync/async mode support to Optique, a type-safe CLI parser\nfor TypeScript. It turned out to be one of the trickier features I've\nimplemented—the object() combinator alone needed to compute a combined mode\nfrom all its child parsers, and TypeScript's inference kept hitting edge cases.\n\nOptique is a type-safe, combinatorial CLI parser for TypeScript, inspired by\nHaskell's optparse-applicative. Instead of decorators or builder patterns,\nyou compose small parsers into larger ones using combinators, and TypeScript\ninfers the result types.\n\nThe type inference works through arbitrarily deep compositions—in most cases,\nyou don't need explicit type annotations.\n\nLucas Garron (@lgarronLucas Garron) opened an issue requesting\nasync support for shell completions. He wanted to provide\nTab-completion suggestions by running shell commands like\ngit for-each-ref to list branches and tags.\n\nAt first, I didn't like the idea. Optique's entire API was synchronous, which\nmade it simpler to reason about and avoided the “async infection” problem where\none async function forces everything upstream to become async. I argued that\nshell completion should be near-instantaneous, and if you need async data, you\nshould cache it at startup.\n\nBut Lucas pushed back. The filesystem is a database, and many useful\ncompletions inherently require async work—Git refs change constantly, and\npre-caching everything at startup doesn't scale for large repos. Fair point.\n\nSo, how do you support both sync and async execution modes in a composable\nparser library while maintaining type safety?\n\nThe fourth requirement is the tricky one. Consider this:\n\nThe combined parser should be async because one of its fields is async.\nThis means we need type-level logic to compute the combined mode.\n\nI explored five different approaches, each with its own trade-offs.\n\nAdd a mode type parameter to Parser and use conditional types:\n\nThe challenge is computing combined modes:\n\nA variant of Option A, but place the mode parameter first with a default\nof \"sync\":\n\nThe default value maintains backward compatibility—existing user code keeps\nworking without changes.\n\nDefine completely separate Parser and AsyncParser interfaces with\nexplicit conversion:\n\nSimpler to understand, but requires code duplication and explicit conversions.\n\nThe minimal approach. Only allow suggest() to be async:\n\nThis addresses the original use case but doesn't help if async parse() is\never needed.\n\nUse the technique from fp-ts to simulate Higher-Kinded Types:\n\nThe most flexible approach, but with a steep learning curve.\n\nRather than commit to an approach based on theoretical analysis, I created\na prototype to test how well TypeScript handles the type inference in practice.\nI published my findings in the GitHub issue:\n\nBoth approaches correctly handle the “any async → all async” rule at the\ntype level. (…) Complex conditional types like\nModeValue<CombineParserModes<T>, ParserResult<TState>> sometimes require\nexplicit type casting in the implementation. This only affects library\ninternals. The user-facing API remains clean.\n\nThe prototype validated that Option B (explicit mode parameter with default)\nwould work. I chose it for these reasons:\n\nThe CombineModes type computes whether a combined parser should be sync or\nasync:\n\nThis type checks if \"async\" is present anywhere in the tuple of modes.\nIf so, the result is \"async\"; otherwise, it's \"sync\".\n\nFor combinators like object(), I needed to extract modes from parser\nobjects and combine them:\n\nThe type system handles compile-time safety, but the implementation also needs\nruntime logic. Each parser has a $mode property that indicates its execution\nmode:\n\nCombinators compute their mode at construction time:\n\nLucas suggested an important refinement during our\ndiscussion. Instead of having run() automatically choose between sync and\nasync based on the parser mode, he proposed separate functions:\n\nPerhaps run(…) could be automatic, and runSync(…) and runAsync(…) could\nenforce that the inferred type matches what is expected.\n\nI applied the same pattern to parse()/parseSync()/parseAsync() and\nsuggest()/suggestSync()/suggestAsync() in the facade functions.\n\nWith the new API, creating an async value parser for Git branches looks\nlike this:\n\nNotice that parse() returns Promise.resolve() even though it's synchronous.\nThis is because the ValueParser<\"async\", T> type requires all methods to use\nasync signatures. Lucas pointed out this is a minor ergonomic issue. If only\nsuggest() needs to be async, you still have to wrap parse() in a Promise.\n\nI considered per-method mode granularity (e.g., ValueParser<ParseMode, SuggestMode, T>), but the implementation complexity would multiply\nsubstantially. For now, the workaround is simple enough:\n\nSupporting dual modes added significant complexity to Optique's internals.\nEvery combinator needed updates:\n\nFor example, the object() combinator went from around 100 lines to around\n250 lines. The internal implementation uses conditional logic based on the\ncombined mode:\n\nThis duplication is the cost of supporting both modes without runtime overhead\nfor sync-only use cases.\n\nMy initial instinct was to resist async support. Lucas's persistence and\nconcrete examples changed my mind, but I validated the approach with a\nprototype before committing. The prototype revealed practical issues (like\nTypeScript inference limits) that pure design analysis would have missed.\n\nMaking \"sync\" the default mode meant existing code continued to work\nunchanged. This was a deliberate choice. Breaking changes should require\nuser action, not break silently.\n\nI chose unified mode (all methods share the same sync/async mode) over\nper-method granularity. This means users occasionally write\nPromise.resolve() for methods that don't actually need async, but the\nalternative was multiplicative complexity in the type system.\n\nThe entire design process happened in a public GitHub issue. Lucas, Giuseppe,\nand others contributed ideas that shaped the final API. The\nrunSync()/runAsync() distinction came directly from Lucas's feedback.\n\nThis was one of the more challenging features I've implemented in Optique.\nTypeScript's type system is powerful enough to encode the “any async means all\nasync” rule at compile time, but getting there required careful design work and\nprototyping.\n\nWhat made it work: conditional types like ModeValue<M, T> can bridge the gap\nbetween sync and async worlds. You pay for it with implementation complexity,\nbut the user-facing API stays clean and type-safe.\n\nOptique 0.9.0 with async support is currently in pre-release testing. If\nyou'd like to try it, check out PR #70 or install the pre-release:",

    "fullText": "As far as the Russians were concerned, they had got their man.\n\nDenis Kapustin, one of the most prominent anti-Putin Russians fighting on behalf of Ukraine, was reported dead on Dec 27, assassinated by a drone on the southern front.\n\nHe had long been hunted by Moscow and the price on his head reflected this: Russian intelligence services had offered $500,000 (£370,000) to anyone who killed him.\n\nRussia paid this out after news broke of the successful hit this week. But what Vladimir Putin’s intelligence services did not know was that they had handed the money directly to Ukraine.\n\nMr Kapustin, known by his nom de guerre “White Rex”, founded the pro-Ukrainian Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) in 2022.\n\nThe group made headlines in 2023 and 2024 when it carried out cross-border incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions, humiliating the Russian president and his generals.\n\nHis death was first confirmed by the RDK itself. “We will definitely take revenge, Denis,” the group said on Telegram. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nYet on New Year’s Day, in a morale-raising ruse, Mr Kapustin re-emerged – alive and unscathed – in a video posted by Ukraine’s military intelligence (HUR).\n\n“Welcome back to life,” Gen Kyrylo Budanov, head of HUR, said with a wry smile. He congratulated Mr Kapustin and his team on a successful operation to deceive their Russian adversaries.\n\nIt turns out HUR, along with the RDK, had hatched a plan to fake Mr Kapustin’s death and claim the $500,000 bounty from Russia for themselves, to be used in Ukraine’s war effort.\n\n“First of all, Mr Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” Gen Budanov added.\n\nRussia’s FSB and GRU agencies have long been feared for their ruthlessness.\n\nBut Ukrainian intelligence, throughout the near four-year war, has consistently proved its ability to outsmart their Russian counterparts, carrying out assassinations of generals and Kremlin officials on Russian soil, orchestrating complex sabotage operations and recruiting Russian agents.\n\nIn November, it was reported that Ukraine’s intelligence services used Russia’s own agents to accept missions offered openly by the FSB for financial reward and sabotaging its objectives.\n\nIn one case, a Ukrainian double-agent accepted a task from a Russia jobs board to build a bomb, which was then handed to a Russian saboteur.\n\nThe bomb, however, was made using flour and the Russian agent was captured by Ukraine after it failed to detonate.\n\nUkraine has also claimed responsibility for assassinations of high-ranking Russian officials, while Kyiv is suspected to have been behind many others.\n\nIn April, Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy chief of the main operations directorate of Russia’s army, was killed by a car bomb on Nesterov Boulevard in the Balashikha suburb of Moscow.\n\nBaza, a Russian media outlet with sources inside law enforcement agencies, said the home-made bomb was strapped to a parked Volkswagen car and detonated remotely when Moskalik, who lived in the neighbourhood, walked past.\n\nA month later, a former Ukrainian politician was shot dead in what appeared to be a professional hit job at the entrance of an exclusive school in Madrid.\n\nAndriy Portnov, a pro-Russian politician who worked as a close aide to the Moscow regime, was dropping off his daughters when an assassin shot him several times.\n\nThe shooting took place at the American School of Madrid while other parents were also making the school run.\n\nMost recently, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head ‍of the Russian army’s operational training ‍directorate, died in an explosion on Dec 22 in Moscow, probably planted by Ukrainian special forces.\n\nThe force of the explosion was such that at least seven cars parked nearby also sustained damage\n\nThe general worked in the Russian ministry of defence and participated in combat operations in Chechnya, Syria and Ossetia as well as Ukraine.\n\nAmong the most striking assassinations was the killing of Lt Gen Igor Kirillov on Dec 17 2024.\n\nThe officer, who was in charge of Russia’s nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, was killed by a remotely detonated device hidden inside an electric scooter.\n\n“Kirillov was a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against the Ukrainian military,” a Ukrainian security source said.\n\nIn a daring mission in June 2025 – dubbed Operation Spiderweb – Ukraine-operated drones destroyed several Russian surveillance aircraft and nuclear-capable bombers, with officials in Kyiv saying this rendered a third of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers useless.\n\nThe drones had been smuggled into Russia and assembled, and launched from trucks deep within Russian territory, in another huge victory for Ukraine’s spies.\n\nUkraine’s latest intelligence success means Denis Kapustin, a far-Right extremist and former football hooligan, is inside Ukrainian territory and “preparing to continue carrying out assigned tasks”, said a Ukrainian commander.\n\nThe commander’s family moved from Moscow to Germany when Mr Kapustin was 17 and he relocated to Ukraine in 2017.\n\nSince 2019, he has been banned from entering the Schengen Area for promoting neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nIn the early weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Mr Kapustin helped set up units that would become Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade that played a key role in defending Kyiv and later become renowned for its fierce fighting on the eastern front.\n\nResponding to reports of his death, the 3rd Army Corps said: “We together confronted the common enemy in the battle for Kyiv.”\n\nIt added on Dec 27: “He perceived [Ukraine] as a place of real resistance and freedom.”\n\nIn August 2022, Mr Kapustin set up the RDK, with the goal of overthrowing Putin to bring “peace to Russia”. Its stated aim is to end Putin’s regime of “lies, corruption, and lawlessness”.\n\nIt is made up of former Wagner Group recruits, some former FSB agents and civilian volunteers. It is deemed a terrorist organisation by Russia.\n\nRussian courts have twice sentenced Mr Kapustin to life imprisonment in absentia on treason and terrorism charges.\n\nIn March 2024, the RDK stormed into Russia alongside other anti-Kremlin militias on tanks and armoured vehicles. It clashed with Russian security services and captured Russian soldiers.\n\nKyiv has said that while it fights as part of Ukraine’s military, under its command, the incursions into Russia were not taking place under Kyiv’s orders.\n\nSince its incursions, the group is either fighting at the front or engaged in cross-border sabotage operations in Russia.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph in September, an RDK commander known as “White”, a 26-year-old Russian volunteer, described how he joined in order to exact revenge on Putin for invading Ukraine.\n\n“We fight to change something in Russia,” he said. “When the war ends, I will continue fighting until Putin falls.”",

    "fullText": "The imminent 130th anniversary of the Louis Vuitton monogram is less a birthday and more a demonstration of how powerful two letters can be.\n\nBorn in 1896, when the Époque was at its most Belle, the superposed initials LV appeared amidst a variety of foliate and geometrical motifs. At first it was not a success. “The public was initially reticent and demanded the chequered and even the striped canvas, but my father stood firm,” recalled Gaston-Louis Vuitton of his father Georges Vuitton, son of the founder.\n\nThe striped and chequered patterns he mentions refer to previous designs. Every decade or so, Vuitton changed the pattern of the canvas with which it covered its famous, flat-topped trunks. Trianon grey came first in 1858. In 1872, the grey gave way to stripes. The checkerboard Damier pattern came in 1888, and was the first time that the maker’s name appeared on luggage, with the words “Marque L Vuitton Déposée” (which translate as “L Vuitton registered trademark”) appearing every so often in the checks.\n\nThe Damier was intended to scare off counterfeiters. It didn’t work — which leads us to the monogram we know today. If Georges thought that this new design would deter the fakers, a summer stroll along a 21st-century Mediterranean beach, with its itinerant vendors of imposter Louis Vuitton bags, shows just how comprehensively he failed.\n\nGeorges Vuitton had inadvertently created one of, if not the, most recognisable hieroglyphs in the history of luxury goods. This was not branding as we know it today; it was more akin to an artist signing a canvas. As well as a hint of the Japonisme, the mania for all things Japanese that gripped France in the late 19th century, the geometric emblems attested to Georges Vuitton’s fascination with the ogives and spandrels of Gothic architecture. In particular, he was a great admirer of the work of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, the French architect who revolutionised the study and restoration of medieval architecture.\n\nViollet-le-Duc’s reputation may since have faded, but the patterned monogram is known in every corner of the globe. This January, the house will embark on a year-long celebration with the familiar dramatis personae taking to the stage: the Speedy of 1930; the Keepall, also from 1930; the Noé, made for a champagne producer in 1932 to carry five bottles (four upright and the fifth inverted); the Alma, Parisian architecture translated into handbag in 1992; and, finally, the Neverfull of 2007 — capable, so Vuitton says, of carrying up to 100 kilogrammes but more usually functioning as a capacious tote.\n\nThe bags will appear in different guises throughout the anniversary year. Most striking of the three celebratory capsules is Monogram Origine, a collection of the classics (minus, for some reason, the Keepall), that returns to Georges’s first pattern but deploys a newly developed coated linen/cotton canvas that comes in its recognisable chocolate-brown Ebène shade as well as a soft rainbow of pastels. All of which provide further proof, if further proof were needed, that at 130 years of age, the famous monogram is as versatile as it is well known.",

The mercury stood at a chilly 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14.4 degrees Celsius) at the 8 a.m. start of the parade.\n\nAcross the country, in New York City, hats and gloves were as necessary as noisemakers at the city's New Year's Eve ball drop, where temperatures near freezing appeared to be the coldest in 10 years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people gather along the nearly six-mile (10-kilometer) route in Pasadena, where the two-hour parade kicked off. Millions more watch on national television. Organizers at the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the group that organizes the parade ahead of the Rose Bowl college football game, said they made only small changes to accommodate the weather, such as the tops being up on convertibles carrying grand marshal Earvin “Magic” Johnson and other VIPs.\n\nRain forecasts for the Rose Parade, which had been dry for 20 years, grew all week. On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for all California counties and a coastal flood advisory through Sunday afternoon along much of the Pacific Coast near San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in the areas hit hardest by last year's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires were under evacuation warnings.\n\nIn New York City, the sun came out ahead of Mayor Zohran Mamdani's inaugural celebration, but other areas of the Northeast and Midwest were hit by an Alberta clipper storm and trailing Arctic front that brought snow squalls and high winds.\n\nConditions varied widely — from snow showers to heavier squalls — from Wisconsin through northern Illinois and Michigan and into northern New Jersey, southeastern New York and New England.\n\nAbout a quarter of flights were delayed out of both San Diego International Airport and Boston Logan, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO, Calif. (FOX5/KUSI) — Heavy rain soaking San Diego on New Year’s Day caused widespread flooding and prompted multiple water rescues across the county, as storm runoff overwhelmed roads and drainage systems and left drivers and pedestrians trapped in fast-moving water.\n\nSome of the most severe flooding was reported in Mission Valley, a low-lying area known for flooding during periods of sustained rain. Water remained pooled in parts of the neighborhood hours after the heaviest rainfall, underscoring how quickly conditions deteriorated.\n\nEmergency crews responded to numerous rescue calls throughout the day, including along Fashion Valley Road, where rising floodwaters stranded motorists. In one incident, firefighters rescued one adult and one child from a Jeep that became partially submerged as water levels rose rapidly.\n\nSan Diego Fire-Rescue officials said another rescue unfolded nearby at Camino de la Reina and Avenida del Rio, where a man became trapped underneath a bridge as floodwaters surged. Search-and-rescue teams deployed a raft to reach him and safely pulled him out before transporting him to a hospital for medical evaluation.\n\n“This is about as bad as I’ve seen it,” said Mission Valley resident Steven Shadpour, who noted that flooding has been a recurring issue in the area. “They told us when I bought the place that Mission Valley is lower elevation, so whenever it rains, it floods down here.”\n\nFire officials emphasized that many of the rescues were preventable and urged the public to avoid flooded roads.\n\nCrews also responded to other storm-related emergencies across the county, including a rescue at Lake Hodges, where a woman was swept by floodwaters and later rescued by helicopter.",

    "description": "Hybrids promise fuel savings and eco-friendliness, but the full story is more complicated. From costly battery replacements to limited highway efficiency, these vehicles come with trade-offs that many buyers overlook. Their environmental impact starts with resource-heavy battery production and ends with complex recycling challenges. This article breaks down the hidden costs and realities behind the hybrid hype.",
    "fullText": "The narrative around electric vehicles has hit a few speed bumps lately. Despite years of relentless marketing and massive production ramps, the EV takeover hasn't quite materialized as some predicted. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz have both extended the life of combustion and hybrid lineups as EV demand has grown more uneven than expected. Volkswagen has said it may keep ICE models longer and even add new ICE offerings without increasing overall investment, by offsetting spending within its existing plan. Mercedes-Benz has also said it will keep upgrading combustion models and has reported higher-than-previously-planned spending on combustion-engine technology alongside delayed electrification targets.\n\nOn the other hand, hybrids are experiencing a surge in popularity, with manufacturers competing to offer a dizzying array of options. It's easy to see the appeal: they promise that sweet spot of substantial fuel savings without the existential dread of range anxiety. For many drivers, it seems like the ultimate compromise.\n\nBefore you sign on the dotted line for that virtuous hybrid, let's yank back the curtain. Hybrids, for all their supposed eco-cred and practicality, come with their own collection of dirty little secrets.\n\nLike their fully electric counterparts, many hybrids rely on lithium-ion batteries. Extracting the necessary metals, lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite, requires heavy-duty mining operations. Needless to say, these aren't exactly quaint backyard digs. The environmental impact is monumental: think open-pit mining operations that resemble lunar landscapes, carving out vast sections of pristine wilderness.\n\nConsider the thirst: Some commonly cited estimates for brine-based lithium extraction in arid regions put water losses at around ~2–2.2 million liters per tonne of lithium, but water use varies widely by site and extraction method (brine vs hard-rock; definitions of ‘water used’ also differ). In arid regions, this puts immense strain on local water supplies, impacting surrounding communities and fragile ecosystems. Beyond the H2O, the chemicals used during extraction and processing are often toxic, posing a significant risk of contaminating soil and groundwater if not meticulously managed. So, that \"green\" hybrid in your driveway might have a rather large, dirty footprint you never see.\n\nBattery warranty terms vary by brand and market. In the U.S., 8 years is common, and some manufacturers offer longer coverage (for example, Toyota extended hybrid battery coverage to 10 years/150,000 miles for 2020 model-year hybrids). While many last beyond that, there's an undeniable truth: they will eventually degrade to a point where replacement is the only viable option.\n\nAnd here’s where your wallet might go into shock. Even though hybrids pack smaller battery packs than pure EVs, they are far from cheap. Hybrid batteries are usually cheaper than full EV packs, but replacements can still be expensive. Many mainstream hybrid battery replacements are often quoted in the roughly $2,000–$8,000 range depending on the vehicle, battery type, and whether the pack is new or remanufactured. By contrast, full EV battery pack replacements are commonly cited in the $5,000–$16,000+ range because the packs are much larger.\n\nIt’s not like you’ll be swapping these out in your garage with a ratchet set; this is a specialized job, meaning you’ll also be on the hook for significant labor costs and the often-overlooked expense of proper battery disposal. That \"savings at the pump\" might just be a future mortgage payment in disguise.\n\nSure, lithium-ion batteries can be recycled at the end of their life cycle. But \"can be\" and \"is readily done\" are two entirely different things. The process is anything but simple. It requires energy-intensive pyrometallurgy or complex hydrometallurgy, far from a casual drop-off at your local recycling center.\n\nCurrently, the infrastructure for large-scale, cost-effective lithium-ion battery recycling is still in its infancy. Few companies are willing to invest heavily in a process that’s both technically challenging and not yet highly profitable. This means it will be a while before someone cracks the code on how to recycle these power packs on a scale large enough to have a significant, positive environmental impact. If you're having a shop replace your high-voltage hybrid battery, Battery handling and end-of-life pathways vary by region and program; recycling exists but can be costly and logistically complex, which can affect what a shop charges for handling.” (No citation needed; this avoids a hard factual claim you can’t universally prove).\n\nThe hybrid variant of a given car model invariably carries a higher sticker price than its gas-only counterpart. While they are generally more affordable than pure EVs, that upfront premium can put them out of reach for budget-conscious buyers.\n\nMany owners justify this extra expenditure by banking on long-term fuel savings. The harsh reality? It can take several years, or even tens of thousands of miles, to actually break even on that initial investment through fuel savings alone. This is particularly true if you're one of those who replace their car every few years; you might never recoup that premium before the next vehicle purchase.\n\nOpting for a hybrid to \"reduce your carbon footprint\" is a noble intention, but it assumes you'll be running predominantly on battery power. The inconvenient truth is that most hybrids are still fundamentally internal combustion engines with electric assistance. They do burn gasoline, and they do emit CO2 into the atmosphere.\n\nFactor in the energy-intensive battery manufacturing process and the vehicle's entire lifecycle emissions (LCA), and you might find yourself with a vehicle that, by some metrics, has a higher initial carbon footprint than a conventional ICE car. Your \"eco-friendly\" commuter still chugs gas, just perhaps with a touch more virtue-signaling.\n\nSure, some hypercars like the McLaren P1 or Ferrari LaFerrari utilize hybrid technology, but that's for mind-blowing power delivery, not just economy. Your average, everyday hybrid is meticulously engineered to maximize fuel efficiency, typically pairing a modest gas engine with electric motors.\n\nThe added weight of the battery pack and electric motor, coupled with the relentless focus on efficiency, sometimes means hybrids are slower to accelerate than their pure ICE counterparts. That extra mass also compromises handling and agility, making them feel less nimble when you try to toss them into a corner. Your hybrid's \"sport mode\" is often just louder engine noise; don't expect it to win any drag races, unless it's against a kid on a scooter.\n\nWhen everything is humming along nicely, or if your hybrid is still comfortably under warranty, maintenance costs may be comparable to those of an ICE vehicle. However, that's often still more than the bare-bones servicing requirements of a pure EV.\n\nThe real financial hit comes when that warranty expires. Hybrids feature dual powertrains, meaning they combine the complexity of a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) with high-voltage electric motors, inverters, battery management systems, and specialized cooling systems. If a high-voltage component fails out of warranty, repairs can be astronomically expensive.\n\nFinding an affordable, independent mechanic who possesses the specialized diagnostic tools and training for hybrid systems can also be a significant challenge, often forcing you to return to the pricier dealership service bay. Another hit to your savings that may put that dream car purchase back yet again, good thing you have your hybrid, I guess.\n\nHybrids are undisputed kings in city driving. Their electric motors excel in stop-and-go traffic, enabling electric-only propulsion at low speeds and recovering energy through regenerative braking. This translates to significantly lower fuel consumption than a gas-only car in urban environments.\n\nHowever, once you hit the open highway, that advantage rapidly diminishes. A hybrid's fuel consumption often rises drastically, the opposite of what you see in an ICE vehicle. At cruising speeds, the gas engine is predominantly engaged. Because it's usually a smaller, less powerful unit lugging around extra battery weight, it has to work harder than an equivalent, lighter ICE car. Your hybrid's city MPG bragging rights tend to disappear faster than a cheap date on the interstate.\n\nWe're constantly fed the narrative that hybrids are inherently more environmentally friendly, but as we've dissected, that's not necessarily true, especially if your driving mostly consists of highway miles. Additionally, if your weekly commute is a short trip to the grocery store and back, paying a significant premium for a hybrid might never yield any financial benefits.\n\nFor a hybrid to truly deliver both environmental and economic advantages, you need to cover a substantial amount of miles, predominantly in city driving or stop-and-go traffic, where the electric assist can do its best work. Otherwise, you're just driving a heavier, more complex gas car.\n\nWhen it comes to pulling heavy loads, traditional gasoline and diesel engines are still the undisputed champions. Even some new EVs, such as the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and Tesla Cybertruck, are proving their mettle in this arena.\n\nHowever, for most mainstream hybrids, towing is an afterthought, if it's even allowed. The smaller internal combustion engines are not designed for sustained heavy loads, and the hybrid systems often lack the necessary cooling capacity or robust driveline components. You're clearly not going to be towing more than a Barbie convertible with something like the Prius.\n\nThe Toyota Sequoia’s maximum tow rating is up to 9,520 lbs when properly equipped (Toyota marketing often highlights up to 9,500 lbs, with exact ratings varying by configuration). The Lexus LX Hybrid is rated up to 8,000 lbs. It's good enough for some campers, but most hybrids are coming nowhere near these numbers. Meanwhile, plenty of gas-fueled SUVs and pickups can breezily tow 10,000-plus pounds, giving you a lot more variety of choices to choose from if towing is your priority. But if the Toyota Sequoia is your dream car, you're in luck.\n\nThat shiny new hybrid typically comes with a steeper insurance bill than its traditional ICE counterpart. This makes perfect sense when you consider the higher purchase price and the increased technological complexity. Insurance companies aren't charities, after all.\n\nBecause hybrid vehicles involve more expensive, specialized components (especially the battery and high-voltage wiring) and require specialized labor for repairs, insurance claims and associated repair costs tend to be higher. Insurance costs vary heavily by model and driver, but some analyses find hybrids average around single-digit percentages higher to insure than comparable gas-only vehicles (one widely cited figure is ~7% higher on average) to insure a hybrid compared to the equivalent gas-only model. That \"eco-friendly\" car also has an \"expensive-to-fix\" price tag for the insurance company.\n\nThe sophisticated lithium-ion batteries found in hybrids (and EVs) are quite particular about their operating environment. They absolutely despise extreme temperatures. When it’s scorching hot, it accelerates battery degradation, leading to a permanent loss of capacity over time. Conversely, when the mercury plummets, the battery's chemical reactions slow down, leading to a noticeable reduction in range, power output, and less efficient regenerative braking. What are they, Goldilocks? Apparently, the temperature has to be juuuust right.\n\nCold temperatures can also significantly impact charging times for plug-in hybrids, forcing the gas engine in standard hybrids to run more frequently and for longer periods to reach optimal operating temperature, thereby directly negating the fuel-saving benefits. Your \"advanced\" battery is pickier about the weather than your aunt Mildred.\n\nToyota famously revolutionized the automotive world with the original Prius hybrid, and the technology has evolved dramatically since then. However, the regulatory landscape is shifting. The EU previously set rules aiming for effectively zero-CO₂ new car sales from 2035, which would have ruled out most hybrids. However, in December 2025 the European Commission proposed changes that would replace an effective 2035 ICE ‘ban’ with a 90% tailpipe CO₂ reduction target, potentially allowing some combustion and hybrid-type vehicles to continue under certain conditions due to their reliance on an internal combustion engine.\n\nMeanwhile, pure EVs are advancing at a breakneck pace, and other alternative technologies like e-fuels (synthetic gasoline) and hydrogen fuel cells are gaining traction. It's entirely plausible that hybrids, despite their current popularity, are merely an interim technology, a bridge to a truly fossil-fuel-free future, destined to be phased out as more efficient and advanced solutions mature. Are hybrids the Betamax of the automotive future or a viable long-term solution despite all their flaws? Only time will tell. In that time, we will be crossing our fingers for your wallet.\n\nLike our content?

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te on Thursday vowed to defend the self-ruled island’s sovereignty in the face of China’s “expansionist ambitions,” days after Beijing wrapped up live-fire military drills near its shores.\n\n“In the face of China’s rising expansionist ambitions, the international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people have the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in his New Year’s address.\n\n“As president, my stance has always been clear: to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, strengthen national defense and the resilience of the whole society, and comprehensively construct an effective deterrence and democratic defense mechanism,” he added.\n\nLai’s comments came days after China wrapped up live-fire drills around Taiwan featuring rocket launches, aircraft and warships. Beijing had expressed anger at a planned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, as well as at Japan’s new leader’s comments that Tokyo could intervene in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to annex it by force if necessary. A former Japanese colony, Taiwan has been governed independently from the mainland since 1949, when the Nationalist Party lost a civil war against the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island.\n\nLai's speech was met angrily in Beijing, where a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office called the president “a saboteur of peace, a troublemaker and a warmonger,” according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n“No matter what Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party authorities say or do, they cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China,\" said spokesperson Chen Binhua.\n\nThe planned arms sale, valued at more than $11 billion, is the U.S.’s largest so far to Taiwan. It includes missiles, drones, artillery systems and military software.\n\nThe United States is obligated by its own laws to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nChina’s leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan’s eventual annexation “ unstoppable \" during his own televised New Year’s address on Wednesday.\n\nTaiwan last year announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called the Taiwan Dome.\n\nThe budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island’s GDP, as part of his strategy amid China’s threats of invasion.\n\n“Facing China’s serious military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait,” Lai said.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this week, Olympic gold medalist and former two-time Heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua was involved in a tragic car accident that claimed the lives of two passengers — his close friends and longtime trainers, Sina Ghami and Kevin Ayodele.\n\nAccording to Sky News, Joshua was discharged from the hospital on Weds., Dec. 31, 2025, and is now recovering at home. Details regarding the nature of his injuries have not been publicly disclosed, though they were described as minor.\n\nThe driver involved in the crash — who had been hired for the trip — was also treated at a hospital and released today. However, TMZ reports that the individual could face criminal charges.\n\nAdditionally, the driver of the stationary truck that Joshua’s car hit is wanted by authorities for fleeing the scene after the fatal crash.\n\n“He could be hit with reckless driving charges as a result of Monday’s incident,” TMZ reported. “The driver of the truck that Joshua’s SUV smashed into fled the scene immediately after the crash and is now being hunted down by officials.”\n\nMeanwhile, The Guardian Nigeria cited preliminary findings suggesting a mechanical failure may have played a role in the accident.\n\n“Preliminary investigations revealed a burst tyre was responsible for the accident in which two-time heavyweight champion Joshua survived but lost two close associates,” the outlet reported, adding that the front passenger-side tyre burst, causing the vehicle to lose control before colliding with a stationary truck.\n\nIn the days following the tragedy, an outpouring of support has emerged for the victims’ families. More than $180,000 has reportedly been raised in honor of Ayodele to help fund the construction of a mosque in his memory — a gesture reflecting the deep impact he had on those around him.",

It's helped to carry this market in 2025. I'm curious how you how you see that AI trade and trend evolving in 2026, Tom.\n\nGood afternoon, Josh. Thank you very much for having me on and happy New Year to everyone. Yeah, so, so we sort of described four pillars of the rally and the most important and first one as you said is AI. and it's really been a rising tide that's lifted all boats, not just this year, but for the past three and a half years, really. But we think that's changing a little bit in 2026. and importantly, it doesn't mean it's necessarily going away, but instead, I think the sort of AI enthusiasm is going to look a lot more like Q4 than it did say Q2 and Q3. and what I mean by that is that it's fractured. So we're not going to have every single tech stock just running away. It's going to become a selection of winners, say like your Micron, and then maybe some losers, like your Oracle and to a point Qualcomm. and I'm not saying to those stocks specifically into 2026, but more as an example that we're going to have to be selective as AI matures.\n\nWell, let me ask you, if AI is sort of more fractured next year, you know, if I'm a viewer or I'm an investor, I'm listening to that. How do I discern, Tom, then the winners and losers in this AI fractured world you're describing?\n\nSo for me, I look at AI as sort of a cycle that's maturing, right? And really the first stage was sort of it was it was the epiphany stage, right? Oh my gosh, we can do this. And then in order to do this, the first thing we need is semiconductors. And now we're going to run out and buy all the semiconductors that we can and obviously Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi have benefited fantastically from this. I see it evolving a bit now into those that those companies that are really taking the leading edge. Probably my top AI pick for 2026 is Google. I like Gemini 3. I think their advantage on search gives them a huge uh sort of chip in the game against Open AI. So I like Google from a search standpoint. I also like the memory because that's sort of the next stage of this data center build out, right? We need the compute power. Well now all of a sudden we need all the memory to power all that we need. So I see it more of an infrastructure play evolving uh towards memory on the infrastructure side, but then also from sort of the hyperscalers, I really like Google uh with YouTube and then with Gemini 3.",

    "fullText": "A “fireball” during the New Year’s Eve Potato Drop fireworks show appeared to shatter glass at a downtown Boise building, injuring a child, according to video and witness accounts.\n\nBoise Fire Department spokesperson Lauren Melink confirmed in an email to the Idaho Statesman that fire crews and Ada County EMS responded to West Bannock Street for reports of a child injured by glass that broke during the fireworks show immediately following the midnight potato drop.\n\nMelink said the child was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.\n\nThe Idaho Potato Drop did not respond to requests for comment Thursday morning.\n\nVideo from the event, which has taken place outside the statehouse since 2016, showed the 17-foot-long potato dropping from a crane as usual. But immediately after the enormous potato finished its descent, an explosion erupted from an area where fireworks were being lit. The video, filmed by Boise resident Joshua Dougherty, includes the sound of glass shattering as the explosion occurred.\n\n“I saw that giant fireball blast, felt it in my chest!” Dougherty told the Statesman via Facebook Messenger.\n\nDougherty, who was standing near the corner of Capitol Boulevard and Bannock Street, said he “immediately heard a ton of glass shattering, felt it raining down on me” and saw a child bleeding from her face.\n\nDougherty’s video shows shattered glass strewn across the sidewalk and broken panes in several window frames of the downtown building.\n\nThe Boise man said bystanders quickly called paramedics to the scene, and the fireworks show carried on without interruption.\n\nA post of Dougherty’s video shared in the Treasure Valley Police Scanner Facebook group garnered hundreds of comments and shares Thursday morning, including accounts from other attendees who said they saw or felt the blast, were hit by debris from the shattered windows or witnessed the paramedics’ response to the injured child.",

    "description": "How Joey McGuire won over Texas Tech with bold outreach and a seven-step plan to jump-start winning as the program's next head coach.",
    "fullText": "Experience isn't everything when it comes to hiring. Just look at Joey McGuire, the head football coach at Texas Tech University.\n\nWhen the Red Raiders began their head-coaching search in 2021, McGuire didn't have as stacked a résumé as his competition. As ESPN reported, he was \"a true underdog candidate.\"\n\nAt the time, McGuire had spent the majority of his coaching career at Cedar Hill High School in Texas, where he had notched three state championships. He also spent a few years as an assistant coach at Baylor.\n\nOn paper, it was the kind of background that would have given many Power 4 programs pause.\n\nTexas Tech's hiring committee may have completely overlooked McGuire had he not reached out himself. According to ESPN, he cold-called athletic director Kirby Hocutt, left a voicemail, and asked for the opportunity to interview.\n\nThat kind of bold outreach can be a differentiator.\n\n\"I always advise not to be too afraid of cold outreach,\" a former Google recruiter told Business Insider in 2023. \"If you're really interested in a company, get in touch with those you want to work with — email the CEO, the head of talent, or the hiring manager and let them know why you're the right person for the job.\"\n\nOnce McGuire got in the room, he made the most of it.\n\nESPN reported that he showed up to the interview with unmatched enthusiasm and \"a seven-step plan for winning.\" The publication said he had with him \"the full list of coaches he would like to hire. He had a detailed plan for fixing in-state recruiting and spoke of waking a sleeping giant.\"\n\nThe preparation left a lasting impression.\n\n\"We were all like, 'We found our guy,'\" Tony Hernandez, a former deputy athletic director and member of the search committee, told ESPN after the meeting.\n\nTexas Tech ultimately decided to go with McGuire, and the gamble has paid off.\n\nWhile the Red Raiders fell to Oregon in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals on Thursday, under McGuire, the team has surged from relative obscurity to a program-record 12 wins in 2025. They also secured their first outright conference championship since 1955 when they toppled BYU last month.\n\nMcGuire's story is a good reminder that a little preparation can go a long way, no matter what type of job you're applying for.\n\nAs business etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore told BI, \"Most people don't do the proper research about the company. We have so many resources to use, including LinkedIn, websites, and social media. There's no excuse for you to go into an interview and not know about the company and something about who might be interviewing you.\"",

So, like if I'm not moving, I feel awful, you know? And I'm like the kind of person that's like, and even if it's 20 minutes a day, you're golden,\" Hudson told podcast hosts Jessie and Lennie Ware.\n\nThe actor said she often uses that to encourage people who are reluctant to start exercising.\n\n\"I'm like, just go in for 20 minutes. Just like, move your body. Just go lift some weights. Stand in front of the mirror and just do something,\" Hudson said.\n\nEven a small amount of daily movement can create a \"domino effect\" that motivates people to make healthier choices and be more active, she said.\n\nHudson said she varies her workouts depending on how she's feeling, sometimes focusing on yoga, stretching, and breathwork, and other times on weightlifting.\n\n\"Even this morning, it's like, I couldn't not wake up and move my body,\" she said.\n\nShe told Women's Health in a 2019 interview that she eats about five times a day and her go-to workout is Pilates.\n\n\"I love how flexible I get and what it does to the shape of my body,\" Hudson said.\n\nIn an October interview with EatingWell, Hudson shared her morning routine, which includes going outside barefoot and spending time in the sun.\n\n\"I wake around 6 a.m. and do some sort of meditation practice while I drink warm water with lemon. I also try not to look at my phone during this time,\" Hudson said.\n\nHudson isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about fitting shorter workouts into their busy schedules.\n\nHelen Mirren, 80, has long been a fan of a 12-minute military workout developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1950s.\n\n\"It is the exercise I have done off and on my whole life. It just very gently gets you fit,\" Mirren said.\n\nIn February, Kristen Bell, 45, told Business Insider that she tries to fit short bursts of exercise into her days by treating them like exercise \"snacks.\"\n\n\"I keep a set of 10 or 15-pound weights underneath furniture so when I'm cooking dinner, if I haven't worked out that day, I'll do a set of bicep curls or shoulder presses while something simmers on the stove. Sometimes my workouts are sliced into my day in one-and-a-half-minute segments,\" Bell said.",

    "fullText": "Chinese tech stocks kicked off 2026 by testing how far their AI-fueled rally can run.\n\nShares of Shanghai Biren Technology, an AI chip designer, surged nearly 120% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by midday on Friday after the company raised 5.58 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $717 million, in an initial public offering.\n\nThe stock opened at 35.70 Hong Kong dollars, well above its IPO price of 19.60 Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThat appetite was reflected across the offering, with the retail portion subscribed more than 2,300 times, according to exchange filings, underscoring intense interest in China's homegrown AI hardware sector.\n\nThe enthusiasm has been building more broadly. Chinese AI and semiconductor stocks have rallied since the breakout of the China-made DeepSeek-R1 AI model in January last year, which helped push the Hang Seng Tech Index 23% higher in 2025. The index jumped by as much as 3.9% on Friday.\n\nWashington's tightening export controls on advanced Nvidia chips have also fueled the boom by accelerating demand for domestic alternatives.\n\n\"Nvidia's once-dominant position in China's AI chip market has effectively evaporated in 2025, marking a seismic shift in the global intelligent-computing landscape,\" wrote Andrei Zakharov, an analyst who publishes on Smartkarma, in a note last week.\n\nShanghai Biren's stunning stock market debut underscored China's AI rally, which reversed a few bruising years for the country's tech sector amid a regulatory crackdown and broad economic challenges.\n\nFollowing the DeepSeek-R1 breakout, startups such as Cambricon, Moore Threads, and Metax have drawn billions of dollars in funding as they race to supply chips for data centers, large language models, and industrial AI applications.\n\nThat surge in capital is also translating into personal fortunes, with China's AI chip boom minting billionaires at breakneck speed even as the broader economy continues to sputter amid a long-drawn property crisis.\n\nShanghai Biren's blockbuster debut is expected to be followed by more fresh supply, with Hong Kong emerging as the key venue for that fundraising drive.\n\nBaidu, a Chinese big tech firm, said on Friday that its artificial-intelligence chip unit has confidentially filed for a Hong Kong listing.\n\nAt least 25 companies made their market debuts in Hong Kong last month, marking the busiest month for IPOs since November 2019, according to Bloomberg data. About half of those listings were technology firms.\n\nMore AI-related Chinese tech listings are expected this month. They include startup MiniMax Group and Knowledge Atlas Technology, also known as Zhipu AI, which are expected to make their debut next week.",

    "fullText": "The California Department of Motor Vehicles said this week that approximately 325,000 Californians will be required to replace their Real ID licenses because of a software error.\n\nIn the coming weeks, DMV officials said, about 1.5% of those holding Real IDs will be notified that they “need to take action” to “ensure continued compliance with federal REAL ID regulations.”\n\n“The DMV is informing affected individuals of the steps they need to take,” officials said in a news release issued Wednesday. Fees associated with reissuing the IDS will be waived for those affected.\n\nDMV officials said the problem was discovered after a review of technology systems revealed that some legal immigrants had been issued Real IDs that did not expire at the same time as their authorization to remain in the country.\n\nThe Real ID Act was signed into law in 2005 and established security standards for state-issued IDs for things like boarding planes. But implementation was repeatedly delayed, and the requirement finally went into effect in May of 2025. DMV officials said they discovered that a “small subset” of Real IDs issued to lawful permanent residents “applied the standard credential renewal interval in some cases, instead of the expiration of a REAL ID holder’s authorized stay.”\n\n“We proactively reviewed our records, identified a legacy system issue from 2006, and are notifying impacted customers with clear guidance on how to maintain a valid California-issued credential,” DMV Director Steve Gordon said. “For nearly 99% of REAL ID holders, no action is required. The DMV remains committed to serving all Californians and ensuring REAL ID credentials meet federal standards.”\n\nOfficials said the problem came about because of “legacy coding from 2006.” But the release added that all those who had been issued Real IDs received them only after the federal system had verified their lawful presence in the country, and that no one who was undocumented got one.\n\nA.

The airline's daily flight from Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) will run for the last time on Feb. 14. For the time being, BGA will serve exclusively general aviation like flight training, air ambulances and agricultural flights as airport authorities remain in talks to try to bring in other commercial airlines.\n\n\"Air service decisions involve many factors that are outside the control of local airports and communities,\" GBA Commissioner of Aviation Mark Heefner said in a statement. \"We are in active discussions with Delta and are working closely with our state, local, and federal partners to re-establish passenger service as soon as possible.

Palantir's gain of more than 32-fold from its low in 2022 is one notable example.\n\nThe best part of the AI story is that it has probably just begun. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31% through 2033.\n\nThat probably means other stocks hold the potential for 10-fold gains by 2036. While a lot can happen in 10 years, these stocks are on track to make such gains as they help advance AI.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) may seem like a strange choice. For one, it lags market leader Nvidia in the AI chip industry, and it's up more than 13,000% from its 2015 lows.\n\nStill, AMD is on track to become the first company with the potential to match or possibly catch up to Nvidia in the AI accelerator market. The company has made the claim that its upcoming MI450 accelerator will accomplish that goal, and it will probably be onward and upward if it can meet that expectation.\n\nAdditionally, AMD's CPUs still make it a force in the PC market, and its gaming and embedded segments will also benefit from the technology it has developed.\n\nMoreover, AMD forecasts a 30% CAGR for revenue over the long term, with that rising to a 60% revenue CAGR for the data center segment that designs its AI accelerators.\n\nInvestors may have already begun to take notice, as AMD stock is up over 70% over the last year. Also, while its 105 P/E ratio could deter some investors, it's probable that others will buy shares at its current forward P/E ratio of 53. Such levels make it easier to take a chance on this increasingly influential AI giant.\n\nCoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) has begun to emerge as a leading AI cloud platform.\n\nIndeed, tech giants like Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure lead the overall cloud market. Still, CoreWeave has built a competitive advantage with a cloud specifically tailored for AI workloads, particularly when its ecosystem works with Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nAdditionally, CoreWeave takes on a task most companies don't want to do themselves, namely building and maintaining data centers. This means more organizations will probably turn to CoreWeave rather than taking on this task in-house.",

    "fullText": "Portions of North Gene Autry Trail, Indian Canyon Drive, East Vista Chino and Araby Drive remain closed Thursday, Jan. 1 due to flooding.\n\nSouth Araby Drive is closed between Anza Trail and Stagecoach Road due to flooding. North Indian Canyon Drive remains closed between Sunrise Parkway and Garnet Avenue at the wash, and East Vista Chino remains closed between Clubhouse View Drive and Carmela Drive in Palm Springs. The four road closures were reported between 9:30 p.m. New Year's Eve and 5:20 p.m. New Year's Day.\n\nSo, how much rain have we gotten so far?\n\nMore: Flooding shuts down road in Desert Hot Springs on New Year's Day\n\nPhilip Gonsalves, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Diego, urged motorists to exercise caution and avoid driving through low-water crossings during a conversation about rainfall totals.\n\nHe said Palm Springs recorded about 0.58 inches of rain in the past 12 hours. The city typically receives less than a tenth of an inch on any given day this time of year.\n\nMeteorologists track rainfall from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30, which captures the region's full rainy season. In total, since October, Palm Springs has received 2.34 inches of rain, exceeding the normal 1.11 inches for that period.\n\nWinter storms typically bring limited rain to desert areas because surrounding mountains block much of the moisture — a rain shadow effect. The low-pressure system, Gonsalves said, pulled in deep tropical moisture from farther south, with moisture extending high into the atmosphere, allowing rain to fall even in areas that are usually shielded by the mountains.\n\nShowers are expected to taper off by mid to late afternoon Thursday as rain moves northeast out of San Diego County. Light, isolated showers could linger overnight, but they are expected to be brief and scattered.\n\nThe added moisture, however, comes with trade-offs.\n\n\"Everything comes with advantages and disadvantages, right? From one perspective, it's a good thing, but it comes with risks,\" he said. \"And in Southern California, one of the risks is flooding.\"\n\nAs rain ushered in the new year across the Coachella Valley, it's the kind of start that invites a little puddle-jumping while it lasts.\n\n\"Well, isn't that true for most things?\" Gonsalves said.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nJennifer Cortez covers education in the Coachella Valley.

    "fullText": "Tommy Lee Jones' daughter Victoria Jones was found dead on Thursday, Jan. 1, according to a report\n\nVictoria made some onscreen appearances in film and television in the early 2000s\n\nVictoria Jones, the daughter of actor Tommy Lee Jones, was found dead on Thursday, Jan. 1 in San Francisco, according to reports. She was 34.\n\nTMZ was first to report the news of Victoria's death, citing law enforcement sources.\n\nThe San Francisco Fire Department confirmed to PEOPLE that it responded to a medical emergency at the San Francisco Fairmont just before 3 a.m. local time on Thursday. The fire department said that an unnamed individual was found dead at the scene.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department additionally confirmed to PEOPLE that officers responded to the hotel on Thursday, where they met with paramedics and declared an unnamed adult female dead.\n\nNBC Bay Area also reported that a police source told the outlet that the woman found dead at the hotel is believed to be Victoria.\n\nA cause of death is unknown, though NBC Bay Area said that foul play is not suspected.\n\nThe San Francisco Fairmont, San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and a rep for Tommy did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's requests for comment.\n\nVictoria was the daughter of Tommy, now 79, and his ex-wife, Kimberlea Cloughley. The couple also shares a son, Austin Jones, 43.\n\nShe did some acting at a young age, first appearing in her father's film, Men in Black II, back in 2002. She was also in 2005's The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, a film directed by her father and which featured her stepmom, Dawn Laurel-Jones, as the stills photographer.\n\nIn addition to her film roles, Victoria made an appearance in the popular teen drama TV series One Tree Hill in one episode in 2003.\n\nTommy is, of course, an Oscar-winning actor, nabbing the Best Supporting Actor honor for 1993's The Fugitive. He has also appeared in JFK, the Men in Black series, No Country for Old Men and Lincoln, among other acclaimed projects.",

    "description": "Iowa football received some unexpected transfer portal news on New Year's Day.",
    "fullText": "Just one day after Iowa beat Vanderbilt in the ReliaQuest Bowl, the program received some unexpected news.\n\nThe NCAA transfer portal officially opens on Friday, but players can announce their intention to enter the portal now. The Hawkeyes have seen a couple of current players do just that, most notably sophomore running back Terrell Washington Jr. That was an expected move, as Iowa possesses a logjam of talent in the backfield, and Washington Jr. could easily get more playing time elsewhere.\n\nIowa saw another player announce their intentions to enter the transfer portal on Thursday, but this one caught many people by surprise. Sophomore punter Rhys Dakin took to X on Thursday with a statement announcing that he's planning to enter the transfer portal and to depart the program.\n\nThankyou, Iowa ❤️ pic.twitter.com/2U9DRZsZvs\n\n— Rhys Dakin (@Rhys_dak1n) January 1, 2026\n\nThis was a shocking announcement from Dakin, who many expected to return to Iowa City for his junior season in 2026. The sophomore had 42 punts in 2025, averaging 43.6 yards per punt with a long of 65 yards. That average was slightly down from his freshman year, when he was an All-Big Ten third-team selection by the media and second-team by the coaches.\n\nDakin had big shoes to fill, coming in immediately after Tory Taylor went to the NFL, and the young Aussie showed a lot of promise. He was coming off one of his best games of the season in the ReliaQuest Bowl, where he punted three times with a 49-yard average per punt. And now he's set to look for opportunities elsewhere.\n\nDakin's departure adds to the losses for the Iowa special teams unit heading into next season. Kicker Drew Stevens and return specialist Kaden Wetjen are set to graduate and move on, while special teams coordinator LeVar Woods is off to East Lansing to join Pat Fitzgerald's coaching staff. The Hawkeyes are going to have a lot of work to do in the portal and recruiting this offseason to replace the production walking out the door.\n\nIowa doesn't have another punter on the roster currently with eligibility for 2026, so Kirk Ferentz and company will look to the portal to find their next guy at that position. If there's one thing fans should trust Ferentz with, it's his commitment to the importance of special teams.\n\nWhile Dakin is a surprising and big loss, fans should believe in the coaching staff to find the right replacement.\n\nContact/Follow us @HawkeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Iowa news, notes and opinions. Follow Zach on X: @zach_hiney\n\nThis article originally appeared on Hawkeyes Wire: Iowa football punter Rhys Dakin to enter transfer portal",

    "fullText": "Indiana football made quite an emphatic statement in its College Football Playoff Rose Bowl quarterfinal matchup against No. 9 Alabama.\n\nBehind a three-touchdown afternoon from Fernando Mendoza and some relentless defense, the top-seeded Hoosiers embarrassed the ninth-seeded Crimson Tide 38-3 in \"The Granddaddy of Them All\" on Thursday, Jan. 1 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California to advance to their first CFP semifinal.\n\nThe Hoosiers' dominant \"business trip\" to the Rose Bowl made some history, as it is tied for the fourth-largest blowout win in the history of the College Football Playoff and the worst loss Alabama has sustained since 1998.

    "fullText": "JJ Redick leans on advice from legendary Lakers coach amid losing stretch originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have lost four of their last five games and are approaching the point in the season where many of their flaws need to be addressed. Their 128-106 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday raised questions of whether or not the team has developed an identity yet.\n\nThe Lakers once again were dominated by an opponent's athleticism, and it prompted head coach JJ Redick to reflect on a conversation he had with Hall of Fame Lakers coach Phil Jackson last season.\n\n\"Think about our team last year, this team is different,\" Redick said. \"Our identity will eventually be different. We didn't get that identity until late January, it felt like, and then we had to shift again.\n\n\"I don't think it's unnatural. I remember a meeting I had with Phil last year, pretty early in the season. And he said, 'I always felt like I knew who my team was by Thanksgiving.' I think that's hard to figure out with this team right now.\"\n\nLos Angeles hasn't been afforded the best bill of health this season. As LeBron James pointed out post game when asked a similar question pertaining to the team's identity, the Lakers have only played one or two games with their full roster.\n\nNot only did James miss the first few weeks of the season, but Austin Reaves is now sidelined for at least a month with a calf strain. Promising rookie Adou Thiero is out for a month with an MCL sprain just as he was starting to find his role on the back end of Redick's rotation.\n\nIt's not hard to see why the Lakers have struggled to find an identity through 30 games, even if, as Redick points out, it's a cop-out or excuse. Los Angeles hasn't been healthy enough to even begin laying the foundation of a true identity.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew Year's Day wasn't a strong one for the Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nComing into a Rose Bowl matchup against the Indiana Hoosiers as the ninth seed in the 2026 College Football Playoff, Alabama's defense didn't just struggle to keep up with Curt Cignetti's squad. Offensively, the Crimson Tide couldn't find any momentum in Pasadena.\n\nIndiana won 38-3, one of the worst CFP performances for the Crimson Tide in the illustrious history of its football program.\n\nHere's where Thursday's Rose Bowl loss ranks among Alabama's lowest-scoring CFP games ever.\n\nMORE: The biggest blowouts in College Football Playoff history\n\nAlabama has now played in a total of 15 College Football Playoff games since the format was introduced in 2014. Previously, only twice have the Crimson Tide failed to break 20 points in those CFP games.\n\nThursday's loss was the lowest-scoring Alabama performance in a playoff game. Before losing 38-3 to Indiana, Alabama's lowest-scoring performance in a CFP game was 16 points in the 2019 national championship. In that game, the Crimson Tide lost 44-16 to Clemson.\n\nHere are Alabama's lowest-scoring CFP games.\n\nAlabama barely avoided a shutout against Indiana, only notching a field goal over four quarters. The team hasn't been shut out in a game in 25 years; the last time the Crimson Tide failed to score in any game was on Nov. 18, 2000, when Auburn blanked Alabama 9-0 in the Iron Bowl.\n\nThe Tigers needed just three field goals in Tuscaloosa to claim their win, as their defense shut out the Crimson Tide. That was Mike DuBose's final game coaching Alabama before Dennis Franchione took over in 2001.\n\nMORE: Where Alabama ranks among all-time winningest college football teams\n\nNot only did Alabama allow 38 points and 413 yards of offense to Indiana, but the total numbers for the Crimson Tide offense were also rough.\n\nTy Simpson threw for 67 yards on 12 completions before backup quarterback Austin Mack went 11-for-16 with 103 passing yards. On the day, the Crimson Tide ran for just 23 yards on 17 carries for an average of 1.4 yards per carry, converting on three of 11 third-down opportunities.",

    "fullText": "Tennessee football is expected to hire Penn State assistant coach Andrew Jackson on Jim Knowles' defensive staff, CBS Sports reported on Jan. 1.\n\nTennessee has not announced Jackson's hiring. It usually does that only after a contract or memorandum of understanding is signed.\n\nJackson's position is unknown, but his background suggests it will be in the defensive front seven.\n\nIn 2025, Jackson served as a defensive analyst and assistant defensive line coach at Penn State, where he worked under Knowles.\n\nJackson was the defensive line coach at Fordham (2017), Old Dominion (2020) and West Virginia (2021-24). He was a defensive quality control coach at Mississippi State (2018) and defensive tackles coach at James Madison (2019). And he was also a Penn State defensive line graduate assistant (2015-16).\n\nJackson worked under Knowles at Penn State in the 2025 season. In December, Tennessee coach Josh Heupel hired Knowles to replace fired defensive coordinator Tim Banks.\n\nTennessee currently has three position coaches in the front seven of the defense. Defensive line coach Rodney Garner's contract expires Jan. 31, 2026, but he is expected to sign an extension. Outside linebackers/edge rushers coach Levorn \"Chop\" Harbin and linebacker coach William Inge each have a contract through January 2027.\n\nBut UT also has an extensive staff of analysts, so Jackson could fill a role there, as well.\n\nAdam Sparks is the Tennessee football beat reporter.

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Alabama rallied from a 17-point deficit once in the College Football Playoff, but there would not be a repeat performance against No. 1 Indiana in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Crimson Tide tried everything possible to stage a historic comeback on the site of so many memorable moments for the program, from a 1926 win that marked the arrival of southern football as a powerhouse on par with the rest of the country, to a 2024 overtime loss that would be legendary head coach Nick Saban's final game, but not even benching star quarterback Ty Simpson in the second half could provide a spark in a 38-3 loss to the Hoosiers.\n\nThe cracks that had been evident throughout a tumultuous season, from the shock opening loss to Florida State that only got worse as the year went on to why Alabama (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) found itself trailing by three scores against Oklahoma in the first round on Dec. 19, finally brought the inevitable conclusion for a talented, but flawed, team.\n\nWithout the benefit of any semblance of a running game, Simpson struggled to create big plays against Indiana's stout defense, going 12 of 16 for 67 yards and running for 17 yards with a lost fumble. The desperation to keep up with Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza had Alabama going for it on fourth down from its own 34 early in the second quarter, leading to an odd Wildcat pop pass that was stopped short.\n\nAustin Mack, who followed head coach Kalen DeBoer from Washington to Alabama before the 2024 season, took over late in the third quarter and managed a field goal on his first drive. That was as much as the third-year sophomore could muster, ending up 11 of 16 for 103 yards with three sacks.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Just when it looked like teams with a first-round bye might be at a disadvantage in the playoff, the Hoosiers defied the narrative and moved close to a national championship.\n\nCurt Cignetti and his players aren't looking that far ahead, though.

    "fullText": "Biggest College Football Playoff blowouts: Here are the largest margins of victory in CFP history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe nature of the College Football Playoff is to pin the best teams in the country against one another, allowing debates over the best squad to be settled in the race for a national championship.\n\nWith 136 FBS teams, the selection process for the CFP can be controversial, but for the most part, only the elite teams wind up competing in the playoff bracket. Every once in a while though, that doesn't matter much, as a CFP matchup becomes a one-sided affair.\n\nFrom the 2023 national championship game, to some lighter first-round opponents in the first-ever 12-team CFP in 2024, there have been some significant blowouts in the history of college football's postseason.\n\nHere are the 13 biggest blowouts in the history of the College Football Playoff.\n\nMORE: How every Heisman Trophy winner fared in the NFL\n\nThe biggest blowout in CFP history came in a title game, as in 2023, Georgia bludgeoned TCU 65-7 to win the national championship. While the Horned Frogs had made the game by beating Michigan 51-45 in the semifinal, they found no such luck against the Bulldogs.\n\nThe 58-point victory for Georgia wasn't just the most lopsided win in a CFP title game; it marked the biggest win in any title game, and at the time, it was the largest margin of victory in any bowl game at the FBS level.\n\nAs the Bulldogs repeated as the champions and completed a 15-0 season, Stetson Bennett threw for 304 yards and four touchdowns, adding another two scores on the ground. Branson Robinson scored twice on the ground, Kendall Milton had a rushing touchdown, Ladd McConkey caught two touchdowns and Brock Bowers and Adonai Mitchell both caught one pass in the end zone — all while TCU scored just one first-quarter touchdown.\n\nMORE: Revisiting the infamous Uga-Bevo attack video with Texas and Georgia\n\nFinal Score: Oregon 59, Florida State 20\n\nA Pac-12-ACC matchup came in the 2015 Rose Bowl, as second-seeded Oregon took on third-seeded Florida State in Pasadena. Unfortunately for the Seminoles, the CFP semifinal game was all Ducks.\n\nOregon beat the defending national champs 59-20, advancing to the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship Game. In the game, the Ducks totaled 639 total yards, including 301 rushing, breaking the record for the most points (59) scored in a Rose Bowl.\n\nMarcus Mariota had 338 passing yards, two touchdown passes, one interception and a rushing touchdown in the win, while Thomas Tyner and Royce Freeman added four more scores on the ground. The Ducks went on to fall by 22 points to Ohio State in the championship.\n\nMORE:Complete history of Lee Corso's College GameDay headgear picks\n\nFinal Score: Alabama 38, Michigan State 0\n\nAlabama was an established powerhouse under Nick Saban by 2015, and he continued flexing his coaching muscles in that year's College Football Playoff. Matched up against Michigan State in the semifinal, the Crimson Tide made light work of the Spartans.\n\nWhile most of Alabama's work was done in the second half, including Jake Coker's two touchdown passes to Calvin Ridley. Derrick Henry was his typical dominant self as well, running for 75 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAlabama picked off MSU quarterback Connor Cook twice, controlling the game from start to finish as it advanced to the title game.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 16 greatest Alabama players of all time\n\nFinal Score: LSU 63, Oklahoma 28\n\nThere's a reason the 2019 LSU Tigers are considered one of the best teams in college football history. In their semifinal playoff game, the Tigers exploded for 63 points against the country's fourth-ranked team, Oklahoma.\n\nEven by the end of the first quarter, LSU led 21-7, and by halftime, it was 49-14. The Sooners simply could not contain Joe Burrow and Ed Orgeron's offense; on the day, Burrow had 493 passing yards and an unreal seven touchdown passes, tying the NCAA records for touchdown passes in a half and touchdown passes in a bowl game. Burrow also ran for an eighth touchdown.\n\nJustin Jefferson caught four of Burrow's touchdowns, setting a College Football Playoff record, Terrace Marshall Jr. had two and Thaddeus Moss had another.\n\nMORE: Most NFL Draft picks by a school in one year\n\nFinal Score: Indiana 38, Alabama 3\n\nTo open their 2026 College Football Playoff run, Indiana, one of the all-time worst football programs in college football history, was tasked with one of the best all-time programs: Alabama. History didn't matter very much in the CFP quarterfinal game.\n\nIndiana stampeded through Alabama, 38-3, stymying Kalen DeBoer's offense all day while Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes. The Hoosiers advanced to the semifinal with the victory, becoming the title favorite with defending champion Ohio State's loss.\n\nAlabama totaled just three points all day in the 2026 Rose Bowl for one of the biggest playoff blowouts ever.\n\nMORE: Where Indiana ranks among all-time losing CFB programs\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 31, Ohio State 0\n\nThere's only two shutouts on this list of CFP blowouts, and one came in 2016, when Clemson decimated Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl, which was a playoff semifinal game.\n\nUrban Meyer coached his unit to a 31-0 win, scoring in all four quarters while his defense didn't allow a single point to the Buckeyes. Despite Deshaun Watson's two interceptions, he also ran for two scores and threw for another.\n\nOhio State registered just nine first-downs all night, with quarterback J.T. Barrett throwing a pair of interceptions as Clemson moved onto the championship.\n\nMORE:The 7 biggest national championship upsets ever\n\nFinal Score: Ole Miss 41, Tulane 10\n\nTulane had a hard time keeping up with Ole Miss in the first round of the playoff in 2025, letting up two quick touchdown drives to start the game and only finding the end zone once in a 41-10 loss.\n\nThe Green Wave actually racked up more than 400 yards of offense, but they struggled to finish drives, turned the ball over three times and slipped up again defensively in the second half after a promising finish to the first half.\n\nOle Miss totaled 497 yards of offense in the win, including 346 passing yards with Trinidad Chambliss in full command.\n\nFinal Score: Penn State 38, SMU 10\n\nIn the first year of the 12-team CFP, Penn State earned the right to host a first-round game in Beaver Stadium, and the opposing environment did not go well for the SMU Mustangs. They were blown out, 38-10, as the Nittany Lions moved onto the quarterfinals.\n\nPenn State's first offensive score didn't come until the five-minute mark of the second quarter, but James Franklin's team was already up multiple scored by then — SMU quarterback Kevin Jennings threw two pick-sixes in the first half.\n\nThe Mustangs didn't find the end zone until the fourth quarter, and even on a day where quarterback Drew Allar had just 127 yards and no touchdowns, Penn State rolled to a CFP win.\n\nMORE: How Penn State's 'White Out' became an annual tradition\n\nFinal Score: Alabama 52, Ohio State 24\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide capped a perfect season with a huge win over Ohio State in the 2021 CFP championship, scoring 35 points in the first half alone to coast against the Buckeyes.\n\nAll night, the Crimson Tide offense was on fire — quarterback Mac Jones threw for 464 yards and five touchdown passes, running back Najee Harris scored three times, and Heisman Trophy winning-receiver Devonta Smith took his 12 catches for 215 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe Buckeyes were playing keep-up from the start, and Alabama won yet another national title under Nick Saban.\n\nMORE: Revisiting Alabama's loaded 2015 coaching staff\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 44, Alabama 16\n\nAlabama came into the 2019 title game as the No. 1-ranked team, but the final score said otherwise. The second-ranked Clemson Tigers had no issues en route to a 15-0 record and national title, winning by 28 points.\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a clean 347 passing yards and three touchdown passes, which went to Justyn Ross, Tee Higgins and Travis Etienne, who also scored twice on the ground. Dabo Swinney's squad used 17 second-quarter points to build its advantage.\n\nClemson won its second national title in three years with its blowout win.\n\nMORE: Where is Clemson located?\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 30, Notre Dame 3\n\nIn a CFP semifinal game, Clemson came in and routed Notre Dame in the 2018 Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Texas. The Tigers, who also went on to blow out Alabama in the championship game, walked away with a dominant 30-3 win over the Fighting Irish.\n\nClemson entered with a 13-0 record behind quarterback Trevor Lawrence, and even a suspension for three players, including starting defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, coming into the game didn't slow the Tigers down.\n\nOf Clemson's 30 points, 27 went unanswered from the first-quarter on. Lawrence threw touchdown passes to Justyn Ross (2) and Tee Higgins, then Travis Etienne put a cap on the win with a 62-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.\n\nMORE: Why are LSU and Clemson both called 'Death Valley'?\n\nFinal Score: Ohio State 42, Tennessee 17\n\nIn hindsight, the fact that Ohio State was the No. 9 seed in the 2024 College Football Playoff bracket looks laughable, but the eventual-champion Buckeyes faced significant questions coming onto the playoff after losing their regular-season finale to Michigan.\n\nHowever, Ryan Day's unit came out and dominated to open the CFP, cruising to a 21-0 start in the first quarter against Josh Huepel's Tennessee squad.\n\nThe Buckeyes advanced to the quarterfinals with a 42-17 win as quarterback Will Howard threw for 311 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, freshman phenom Jeremiah Smith caught two touchdown passes with 103 yards, and running backs TreVeyson Henderson and Quinshon Judkins both scored twice.\n\nMORE: The history of Ohio State coaches' records vs. Michigan\n\nFinal Score: Georgia 34, Michigan 11\n\nAt the 2021 Orange Bowl, Georgia met Michigan for one of the two CFP semifinal games. And on New Year's Eve, it was all Bulldogs.\n\nKirby Smart and Georgia, which would go on to beat Alabama in the title game, took down Jim Harbaugh's Wolverines by 23 points, getting out to a 27-3 lead by halftime and winning 34-11.\n\nStetson Bennett threw for 310 yards and three touchdowns in the win, throwing his scoring passes to Brock Bowers, James Cook and Jermaine Burton.\n\nMORE: Georgia's timeline of trouble under Kirby Smart\n\nHere's a look at the past CFP national title winners.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about College Football Playoff format",

    "fullText": "After a night of rain in Pasadena, the Indiana Hoosiers washed away the weight of history.\n\nEntering the Rose Bowl, College Football Playoff teams coming off first-round byes were winless. At the start of the season, the Hoosiers led college football with the most all-time losses. During their sole previous Rose Bowl appearance in 1968, the Hoosiers lost to USC.\n\nIndiana’s football program spent most of its time stuck in the Big Ten conference basement, but that era is over.\n\nNow, with new blood infused by head coach Curt Cignetti and an offense led by Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, the Hoosiers have turned the page and shattered expectations.\n\nAfter a quarter of brushing off their rust following a three-week break, No. 1 Indiana rolled to a 38-3 Rose Bowl victory over No. 9 Alabama Thursday afternoon in front of a crowd of 90,278. It is the largest postseason margin of defeat in Crimson Tide history.\n\n\"We've come through in clutch moments,\" Cignetti said during his ESPN postgame interview. \"I'm proud of the way they've responded.\"\n\nIndiana scored its first touchdown on a 21-yard pass from Mendoza to Charlie Becker to make it 10-0. It was the first touchdown scored by a Hoosier at the Rose Bowl in program history, the perfect way to establish Indiana’s domination.\n\nIndiana’s defense established its dominance during a pivotal stretch in the second quarter when Alabama could not afford to let the Hoosiers stretch their lead.\n\nFacing fourth-and-one at the Alabama 34, Indiana coach Curt Cignetti called timeout when it was clear the Tide were in a trick play formation. After the timeout, Alabama tried to get the Indiana defense to jump offsides but couldn’t get a penalty and burned a timeout of its own. The teams lined up one more time on fourth down, with Crimson Tide running back Daniel Hill passing to receiver Germie Bernard. Indiana’s Isaiah Jones and Rolijah Hardy combined to stuff Bernand for no gain and a game-defining turnover on downs.\n\nHoosiers fans celebrated the early success after taking over the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day. The sea of cherry red fans planted their flag and made themselves heard. Any time the word Alabama was mentioned, Indiana fans booed and asserted homefield advantage. With the skies clearing after a morning of heavy rain, Hoosiers joyously broke out “Who’s your daddy?” chants.\n\nCignetti kept taking jabs at the Tide defense with heavy use of the run game early in the contest. When it was his turn to pass, Mendoza was nearly perfect. He finished 14 of 16 passing for 192 yards and three touchdowns. He was sacked three times, but Mendoza never turned the ball over.\n\nMendoza contributed to the strong Indiana run game, frustrating the gashed Tide defense. With all his receivers covered, he scrambled for a back-breaking eight-yard run in the third quarter to tighten Indiana’s control of the game.\n\nThe following play, Mendoza threw a 24-yard touchdown to Elijah Sarrat to make it 24-0. He finished with 38 rushing yards.\n\nEntering the game, Indiana wanted to contain Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson. He gave up a critical first-half fumble and struggled to find seams in the Indiana defense. Tide coach Kalen DeBoer eventually benched Simpson, who had been limited by injuries part of this season, at halftime.\n\nCrimson Tide second-string quarterback Austin Mack finished the game with 103 passing yards. Simpson finished the game with 67. Mack threw a 34-yard pass to Bernard in the third quarter, which led to a 28-yard field goal that made the score 24-3.\n\nThe Hoosiers tacked on a Kaelon Black 25-yard rushing touchdown to make it 31-3. He finished the game with 99 yards and one touchdown.\n\nAs clouds dissipated, the Hoosiers booked their ticket to the Peach Bowl, where they will face Oregon in their pursuit of the ultimate team award – the national championship.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Quarterback Lamar Jackson shared his status for the Steelers-Ravens Week 18 game.",
    "fullText": "Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson will play in Week 18 against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a win-or-go-home game.\n\n\"I'm gonna be out there,\" Jackson said.\n\nThis poses a greater challenge for the Steelers' defense, as the two-time MVP is a dynamic quarterback.\n\nIn their first matchup, Pittsburgh did a good job of limiting Jackson, as he completed 19 of 35 passes for 219 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He also rushed for 43 yards and a touchdown on seven carries.\n\nThe Steelers will need another effective defensive performance against the Ravens. Pittsburgh needs to force Baltimore to pass the ball.\n\nIn that game, the Ravens had a strong rushing attack, as Derrick Henry ran for 94 yards on 25 carries and Keaton Mitchell added 76 yards on six carries.\n\nThe Steelers' defense limited Baltimore's passing attack, and that could be crucial if they can force Jackson into must-pass situations.\n\nHowever, a lot will hinge on the effectiveness of Pittsburgh's offense. The Steelers will be without star wide receiver DK Metcalf, who is serving the final game of his suspension.\n\nIn the first game against Pittsburgh, Metcalf had a monster game, hauling in seven receptions for 148 yards. On the season, Metcalf has 59 receptions for 850 yards and six touchdowns.\n\nPittsburgh will also be without another one of their top weapons in tight end Darnell Washington, as he suffered a broken arm. On the season, Washington had 31 receptions for 364 yards and a touchdown.\n\nWithout Metcalf and Washington, the Steelers will need wide receivers Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Adam Thielen to step up, as well as tight end Pat Freiermuth.\n\nThe Steelers' offense struggled in Week 17 against the Cleveland Browns, as they didn't have a reliable weapon for Aaron Rodgers to target.\n\nAgainst the Ravens, they will need to establish the run game with Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell to open up the passing attack. In their first game, the rushing attack was ineffective, as Warren rushed for 13 yards on eight carries and Gainwell had 15 yards and a touchdown on four carries.\n\nThe Steelers will have a tough battle against the Ravens in Week 18 for the AFC North title and a spot in the postseason, and it will be even more challenging with Jackson playing.",

It's shaping up for him to rest in Week 18 against the Jets in favor of backup QB Mitchell Trubisky.\n\nAlthough there's one problem with that: Allen has started 139 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NFL.\n\nMORE: Philip Rivers is retiring from the NFL, again\n\nThere's a loophole way for the Bills to approach this, though. All Allen has to do is play the first snap of the game to extend the streak.\n\nThat's what he did last season, taking the field for the opening snap before trotting off the field with a smile on his face.\n\nIt seems safe to expect Allen to do that again this year.\n\nThe Bills certainly need to prioritize Allen's health for the playoffs, and it appears that's what they're doing.\n\nIf they can extend his streak in a foolproof way in the process, all the better.\n\nDrake Maye has one issue that could stop Patriots from winning Super Bowl\n\nMicah Parsons' injury has crushed the Packers in a very specific way\n\nJalen Hurts has a big problem, and it's not what it used to be\n\nPuka Nacua made the best non-catch you've ever seen\n\nPope Leo XIV gives the Seahawks a good omen\n\nThis viral Josh Allen highlight from Wyoming is crazy",

    "fullText": "South Carolina WR Vandrevius Jacobs plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, per On3’s Pete Nakos. Jacobs was the Gamecocks second-leading receiver in 2025.\n\nHis 32 receptions led South Carolina receivers this season, and totaled 548 yards and four touchdowns as a result. On his career, Jacobs has caught 47 passes for 789 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nJacobs had three 100+ yard performances during the 2025 season. This included matchups vs. Missouri (128 yards, TD), Kentucky (108 yards) and Clemson (141 yards, TD). His performance against Clemson was a career best.\n\nBefore college, Jacobs was a four-star recruit in the 2024 recruiting class per the Rivals Industry Rankings, which is a proprietary algorithm that compiles ratings and rankings from all four primary recruiting media services. He was the No. 338 overall recruit and No. 52 overall player at his position.\n\nHis decision comes after South Carolina’s No. 1 WR in 2025, Nyck Harbor, announced that he’ll be returning to Columbia in 2026.\n\n“You really thought I was going somewhere? Nah,” Harbor said in a video he posted on social media. “Eight’s running it back. Let’s do it.”\n\nAdditionally, QB LaNorris Sellers announced his plan to return to South Carolina next season. The two will provide what’ll be expected to be one of the most exciting duos in the SEC in 2026. Many placed high expectations on Sellers ahead of the 2025 season and while that didn’t pan out the way many believed the would, Sellers will use the 2026 to regain that type ahead of his redshirt junior season.\n\nSouth Carolina finished the season with a 4-8 record, missing out on a bowl game for the second time in three seasons under head coach Shane Beamer. This comes after the Gamecocks broke out for nine wins in 2024. Their strong finish to the year led to South Carolina ranked 13th in the preseason AP Poll and were ranked as high as No. 10 before losing six of their last seven games.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

    "fullText": "On Thursday afternoon, the Alabama Crimson Tide were back in action to play in a must-win game, doing so against the Indiana Hoosiers in the CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl.\n\nWith a trip to the CFP semifinal at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on the line, it was Indiana who secured a victory out in Pasadena, defeating Alabama in blowout fashion, 38-3.\n\nSimply put, this was one of the worst bowl performances in recent memory for the Crimson Tide, one that included a 407-193 total yardage deficit for Alabama against the No. 1 overall seeded Hoosiers.\n\nFollowing are some instant reactions to Alabama's loss against Indiana in the CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl.\n\nOne of the biggest stories from Alabama's loss to Indiana was the performance of the Crimson Tide on both sides of the ball on third down. Offensively, Alabama was held to 3-of-11 on third downs, as well as 0-2 on fourth, while the Crimson Tide defense also struggled, allowing Indiana to convert 9-of-14 attempts.\n\nSimilar to the first round against Oklahoma, Alabama fell behind early on by a sizable margin, but this was a first half deficit the Crimson Tide could not overcome. Alabama turned the ball over on downs, as well as fumbled the ball, in the first half, both of which led to Indiana touchdowns to help build a 17-0 edge at halftime.\n\nWhile the Crimson Tide posted three sacks, Indiana's Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza had a big day against the Alabama defense. In all, Mendoza completed 14-of-16 passes for 192 yards and three scores, while also rushing for 16 yards on eight attempts.\n\nAlabama made a quarterback change in the third quarter following an injury to Ty Simpson, with Austin Mack playing a majority of the second half. Mack ended up completing 11-of-16 passes for 103 yards during the second half.\n\nAs a result of the Crimson Tide's loss in the Rose Bowl, Alabama's season comes to an end in the CFP quarterfinal round with an 11-4 overall record. Indiana will advance to face No. 5 seeded Oregon in the CFP semifinals.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama football instant reactions to Rose Bowl loss vs. Indiana",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlabama’s 38-3 loss to Indiana in the Rose Bowl wasn’t just a defeat, but a historical anomaly that highlighted how far the Crimson Tide fell on college football’s biggest stage.\n\nThe setback marked the worst margin of defeat for the Alabama Crimson Tide in more than two decades. No Alabama team in the past 20 seasons had lost by 30 points, a reflection of the standard established during Nick Saban’s tenure. For first-year coach Kalen DeBoer, it was the most one-sided loss of his time in Tuscaloosa and the program’s worst showing since a 42-6 defeat to Arkansas on Sept. 26, 1998.\n\nBeing held to three points placed Alabama in rare and uncomfortable territory. The Tide had not failed to score a touchdown since the 9-6 overtime loss to LSU in the 2011 “Game of the Century.” More recently, a 24-3 loss at Oklahoma in 2024 ended a long touchdown streak, but the Rose Bowl result went even further. The 35-point margin surpassed the 44-16 loss to Clemson in the 2018 national championship game as the program’s most jarring modern-era defeat.\n\nIndiana left no doubt it belonged. Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza delivered one of the most efficient post-Heisman performances in recent memory, completing 14 of 16 passes for 192 yards and three touchdowns as the Hoosiers controlled the game from start to finish.\n\nThe outcome also intensified scrutiny on DeBoer after a week spent deflecting rumors about the Michigan opening. He now heads into the offseason facing questions about Alabama’s direction.\n\nFor Curt Cignetti and the Indiana Hoosiers, the night was historic.

    "fullText": "While many of the headlines lately seem to be about players making the decisions to explore their options in the transfer portal, Penn State and new head coach Matt Campbell got a bit of big news from one of the top defensive players on the roster. Linebacker Tony Rojas announced he will be staying in Happy Valley in 2026.\n\nRojas shared his announcement to return wiht a post on his Instagram account on Thursday, putting an end to any speculation that he may explore some transfer opportunities this offseason.\n\n\"The past three seasons have been an incredible ride with a lot of historic moments and lifetime memories I will be able to hold on to,\" Rojas said in his statement. \"But as we all know, this season has been nothing but a roller coaster and I was in disbelief and hurt when I went down. I felt like I let myself down and most importantly my teammates down.\n\n\"With that being said, after lots of talks with my family and close ones, I will be returning to Penn State for my senior year,\" Rojas confirmed. \"I'm ready to finish what me and my teammates started and am ready to flip this thing and tell an incredible story with Coach Campbell and his new staff.\"\n\nRojas was one of the rising stars on the defense since his arrival with the program but he suffered what turned out to be a season-ending injury during the 2025 season. His loss from the roster fell in line with the rapid decline of Penn State's season with UCLA being the first team to take full advantage of a Rojas-less Penn State defense. Penn State went on to lose the next four games after that UCLA loss (Northwestern, Iowa, Ohio State, and Indiana) as the defense worked to fix some concerns it had.\n\nPenn State does have a few linebackers choosing to enter the transfer portal, likely resulting in their pending departure from the program. Karui Jackson, Keon Wylie, and Anthony Speca have all reportedly entered the transfer portal.\n\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Penn State LB Tony Rojas announces decision for 2026",

    "description": "A deeper look with @iamcogs at Caleb Williams’ and the Chicago Bears’ 38-42 loss against the San Francisco 49ers",
    "fullText": "Note: Due to unforeseen New Years plans, play reviews won’t be done this week. I will be doing a deep dive into play reviews next week to make up for the lack of them the last two weeks!\n\nFirst and foremost: Happy New Years to all of you Windy City Gridiron faithful! I hope 2026 brings you all the happiness and blessings you deserve!\n\nI don’t think any Bears loss has made me feel as inspired as the loss we had on Sunday Night Football against the San Francisco 49ers last week.\n\nThat’s a weird thing to say, thinking about it, but bear with me.\n\nThere have been many Bears games in the past where our defense just wasn’t on it’s A game, and the opposing teams’ offense boat races us. Take for example the 2014 Chicago Bears. After suffering a crushing 51-23 loss to the Tom Brady led New England Patriots, the Bears, coming out of a bye week, gave up an astounding 55 to rival Green Bay, a game in which the Packers went into halftime with a 42-0 lead.\n\nWhile this is an example taken from perhaps the worst Bears defense ever fielded, there’s some parallels. We were a respectable to good offense during the Trestman era, (perhaps more so in 2013) the Bears defense struggled to stop teams from scoring, and in my cases that offense could not keep up.\n\nOn Sunday night that wasn’t the case.\n\nEach time the 49ers swung, we swung back, even taking a late lead with a 29-yard Cairo Santos field goal. It came down to the final play, but the Bears would fall short to the 49ers 38-42, on a disjointed play due in part to the play call coming in late.\n\nThe Bears offense went blow for blow, on the road, in a playoff atmosphere, against a premiere NFC opponent, and it came down to the last play. And a lot of that is due in part to Bears quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nWilliams shined on primetime, completing 25 of 42 passes for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and a 100.3 Passer Rating (125.7 TPR). He was absolute money when his team was behind all night, and he connected on deep balls over and over again, hitting on all 4 of his deep attempts for 130 yards, 2 touchdown and a perfect 158.3 Passer Rating (for a little fun, that’s a 608.8 on the TPR model!)\n\nAnd this isn’t just a one off thing, if you’ve been following the series you know he’s been steadily playing his best football of his career, in fact his numbers over the last 10 weeks are stellar, and some of his season long numbers have been incredible too.\n\nOver those last 10 weeks:\n71.0% On-Target%\n(LOS: 89.8% | S: 76.1% | M: 58.0% | D: 59.0%)\n2,655 Tot Yards (265.5/game)\n16 Tot TD (3.7% TD%)\n4 Tot Turnovers (0.9% Turnover%)\n12 Sacks (3.3% Sack%)\n9.3 ADOT\n21 Dropped Passes\n8.6% Big Play % | 1.6% Turnover Worthy %\n\nLocked in. https://t.co/gdKGQelzoN\n\n— Grim Cutty (@iamcogs) December 31, 2025\n\nA big play quarterback, with elite level sack avoidance and mobility, who also refuses to turn the ball over is a rare blend of quarterback that us Bears fans have never seen under center.\n\nSo often when it came to prime time I always had extreme levels of Bears related anxiety when it comes to how our quarterback plays. But in 5 prime time games this season, Williams completed 99/176 passes for 1,196 yards, 7 touchdowns and just 1 interception.\n\nI’m so excited to say this, but I’m ready to: We’ve found a franchise quarterback, and it’s going to be a very fun decade of Bears football.\n\n(Totals and averages are all before week 17: Season totals are underlined, Season averages in Italics)\n\nC/A: 285/493 (57.8%) | 19/32.9 (57.8%) | 25/42 (59.5%)\n\nQB at Fault Sacks: 13 | 0.9 | 0\n\nTrue Passer Rating: 126.0 | 125.7\n\nTime to Pressure: 2.64s | 3.11s\n\nPoor Play Rate / Big Play Rate: 9.6% PPR / 7.7% BPR | 2.1% PPR / 10.4% BRP\n\nThe full grading sheet for each play can be found here.\n\nNFL Passer Rating / True Passer Rating / PFF Grade: 100.3 / 125.7 / 71.8\n\nThe average passer rating in the 2025 season sits at 92.3 through week 17. His 100.3 NFL Passer Rating would be considered a good game.\n\nA 125.7 TPR is a solid Good game boarding on great, with 100 serving as the baseline for “Average.”\n\nOn the PFF scale, a score of 70 or higher is considered an Above Average game. With a 71.8, Caleb Williams’ performance was graded as a lower end Above Average game.\n\nPFF’s score is honestly underselling his performance this week, in my opinion. I pointed it out in a tweet earlier this week where Bo Nix was graded higher on the week than Williams, despite a much less impressive performance.\n\nOn-Target Throws: Season Average: 66.2% | Week 17 vs. 49ers: 76.5%\n\nReminder: Completion % ≠ On-Target %. On-target throws are only counted on aimed passes, so throw aways, spikes, and deflections at the line aren’t counted. And drops are counted as on-target.\n\nShort-Level Passing (Behind LOS – 9 yards): 21/26 | 80.8% On-Target\n\nDeep-Level Passing (10–20+ yards): 5/8 | 62.5% On-Target\n\nHis On-Target throwing has improved leaps and bounds. In the first 6 weeks of the season he was sitting at just 59.1%, but over the last 10 weeks his On-Target % is at 71.0%, with each and every one of those 10 games being above his season average On-Target rate. Very obvious and quantifiable growth!\n\n2.1% Poor Play Rate (turnover-worthy + poorly graded plays) against a 10.4% Big Play Rate (great + elite graded plays)\n\nI keep repeating myself here, but this is another week of positive trending when it comes to being under his season mark of PPR and being over his season mark on BPR.\n\nHow about that free play touchdown to Colston Loveland? It’s intangibles like that, that make me excited over the future of this kid.\n\nOver the last 3 weeks his big play rate has exploded, sitting at 8.6%, which is nearly double his season mark of 4.8%.\n\nTime to Throw: We saw a good mix of play-action and pocket passing this week, once again, putting his time to throw charted by me at 2.95 seconds.\n\nPer PFF his time to throw out of play-action last week was 3.75 seconds\n\nNo play-action time to throw sat at 3.03 seconds.\n\nIceman Cometh: The Bears spent a good portion of the game trailing, but Caleb Williams didn’t miss a beat, throwing for 257-yards, 2 touchdowns, and an adjusted 75.0% completion %. Just more proof that when the game is in peril, QB1 delivers.\n\nHis final scores in week 17 of 1st Half (1.05) / 2nd Half (3.95) / Game (5.00) give him another solid “Good” game grade on the season. His 4th game of the season with a “Good” or better grade, he also only has 3 games all season that graded below the score of “Average” (Week 1 vs. MIN, Week 6 @ WAS, Week 12 vs. PIT.) Of the 7 quarterbacks I grade, only Drake Maye has had more Good or better games (7).\n\nOf the seven quarterbacks I grade (with the slight caveat of 3 of those quarterbacks are injured) Williams placed 1st this week, as he continues an extremely impressive back-end performance to the 2025 season.\n\nWeekly scores of every QB I grade can be found here.\n\nThe Bears come back home for the final week of a the 2025 NFL regular season. Crazy to think this season has flown by as fast as it has. The Bears have a few things on the line, a win would lock up the #2 seed in the playoff’s ensuring 2 playoff home games (if they handle business in the wildcard round.) Caleb Williams is also 109 yards away from breaking the Chicago Bears single season passing yardage record held by Erik Kramer, and is 270 yards away from being the franchises first 4,000 yard passer. I predict that he will, in fact, do just that against the Lions at home.\n\nAs always, Bear Down, and we will see you back here next week!\n\nGary Baugher Jr. is a rookie contributor to WCG, bringing football insight backed by over 16 years of experience in organized football and more than 30 years as a passionate fan of the game.

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — No. 1 Indiana became the first team in the brief history of the 12-team College Football Playoff to win a game after receiving a first-round bye, smothering Alabama 38-3 in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Hoosiers (14-0; No. 1 AP, No. 1 CFP) ended a six-game losing streak for teams coming off an extended layoff, including second seed Ohio State falling to Miami in the Cotton Bowl on Wednesday and fourth seed Texas Tech being shutout by Oregon in the Orange Bowl earlier on Thursday.\n\nAn inauspicious start made it seem as if Indiana might continue the trend of teams unable to respond after a long layoff, going three-and-out on the opening possession with Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza taking two sacks. The Crimson Tide (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) then found early success with two quick first downs into Hoosiers’ territory before the defense stepped up to force a punt.\n\nFrom there, Indiana came to life, taking a 17-0 halftime lead on a 31-yard field goal by Nicolas Radicic and two touchdown passes from Mendoza. Avoiding an early deficit was crucial, as it had been something of a constant in the previous losses by idle teams.\n\nThe Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-0 hole at the break against the Hurricanes, and the Red Raiders allowed 104 yards to the Ducks while gaining minus-2 yards in the first quarter. In last year's Granddaddy of Them All, Oregon gave up the first 34 points in a 41-21 loss to eventual national champion Ohio State.\n\nNot spotting Alabama an early advantage allowed Indiana to continue playing to its strengths and eventually wear down the SEC at-large participant.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "As long as the performances on the pitch are positive, the FC Bayern brand might be bulletproof.",
    "fullText": "When a club as big as Bayern Munich does anything, it’s bound to gather attention from the media. Now imagine when the German side do something significantly positive or, even worse, negative. Disaster. Any and every shortcoming Bayern endure is put under the microscope for the unforgiving media to scrutinize.\n\nTake Bayern’s failed attempt to sign Florian Wirtz. The failed transfer signaled a media rampage, ultimately writing Bayern off as a desirable destination for top players without a single minute of the 2025/26 season being played. One signing of Luis Díaz and a few months later, Bayern are the talk of the town across Europe, perhaps even the favorite to win the Champions League. From one end of the pendulum to the other. That’s how quickly things change at Bayern.\n\nOne thing that remains consistent no matter what, is the media. However positive or negative, the white noise doesn’t seem to bother Bayern sporting director, Christoph Freund.\n\n“There’s always a lot going on around FC Bayern,” explained Freund in an interview with Servus Nachrichten (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “So much is being written and so many rumors. The club is just so big and interesting. If a transfer somehow doesn’t work out, then it’s obviously a huge topic. But we’ve always said that we don’t have to do much with our squad. When our injured players come back, we’ll have a really good team. The club hasn’t lost any of its appeal. When something is reported, whether positive or negative, it’s always about FC Bayern Munich. That’s a brand, and it’s a huge one.”\n\nAfter decades of being at the very pinnacle of Europe’s elite, Die Rekordmeister are primed to deal with the media. While headlines and criticism may trigger fans, it’s just another day in the office for Bayern.",

    "fullText": "One of Missouri football’s best defensive players from the 2025 season is entering the NFL Draft process early.\n\nRedshirt sophomore Josiah Trotter, who spent one season with the Tigers and starred at the second level of Mizzou’s 2025 defense, has declared for the NFL Draft as a third-year entrant, he announced via his social media on Thursday, Jan. 1.\n\nIf he wanted them, Trotter had two years of remaining eligibility. He started his career at West Virginia and redshirted his first year in the sport. Trotter was a freshman All-American for the Mountaineers in 2024 before transferring to Mizzou.\n\nInstead, he’ll go through the draft process, and all indications suggest he will be a top-100 prospect this year.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Mizzou learned that fellow third-year and potential NFL Draft entrant Cayden Green will not declare for the draft and instead will return to Columbia in 2026.\n\nAll Glory to God pic.twitter.com/LB5N0p9DEv\n\n— Josiah Trotter (@TrotterJosiah) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Tigers are now waiting on a decision from one final third-year player: defensive end Damon Wilson II, who can stay or declare for the draft.\n\nTrotter was Mizzou’s leading tackler in his lone season in Columbia, racking up 84 total tackles, which included 13 hits behind the line of scrimmage and two sacks.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Trotter as the third-best run-stopping linebacker in the Southeastern Conference and as a top-five pass-rushing LB in the league.\n\nHe has significant professional pedigree in his family.\n\nHis father, Jeremiah Trotter Sr., was a four-time Pro Bowler and Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer who spent more than a decade in the league.\n\nJosiah Trotter’s older brother, Jeremiah Trotter Jr., was on the Eagles roster than won the Super Bowl last season.\n\nMock Draft Database has Trotter listed at No. 107 on its consensus big board for the 2026 draft, which is a fourth-round slot. It would not be a surprise to see the 6-foot-2, 237-pound linebacker climb higher as he goes through the NFL Scouting Combine and Pro Day.\n\nIt’s a significant loss for Mizzou’s defense.\n\nThe Tigers announced earlier Thursday that standout sophomore Nicholas Rodriguez will return in 2026. But, Mizzou is also set to lose two more players from its core, four-player rotation in Khalil Jacobs and Triston Newson to eligibility.\n\nThat means Missouri likely will be active in the transfer portal looking to fill those gaps.\n\nMore: Missouri football needs a QB for 2026. All options come with risks\n\nMore: Missouri football live transfer portal news.

    "fullText": "The term 'Stetson Bennett-esque' has been used to describe Gunner Stockton from time to time throughout his time as Georgia's starting quarterback.\n\nStockton himself told me ahead of the 2025 season that he sees a lot of who he is in Stetson Bennett. And it just so turns out that the the feeling is mutual.\n\nThe legendary former Georgia quarterback was highly complementary of Stockton and said he saw a lot of similarities in their journeys.\n\n\"I'd love to hear what he said about me,\" Bennett laughed to me following the Rams' 27-24 loss to the Falcons on Monday night. \"In terms of you saying he told you he thinks he has the same type of playing style and moxie as me, I totally agree. I love watching him and I'm one of the biggest fans of Georgia that there is.\"\n\nBennett lives and breathes Georgia. That much rang true in his decision to come to Georgia as a walk-on for a second time after going to Jones College, taking a chance against some of the toughest quarterback competition in the nation against then-Bobcats head coach Steve Buckley.\n\nThe rest is history as Bennett became perhaps the best college football player story of all-time. The quarterback still has the same sentiment toward Georgia, even if he's not able to watch the Bulldogs as much as he would like to at this point in his personal NFL journey.\n\n\"Saturdays are our traveling days, so I haven't gotten to watch as much of Georgia as I used to,\" Bennett said. \"But the little bit I've watched, I loved.\"\n\nBennett sees Georgia as the same gritty team he came from, with a story that echoes his own experience with the Bulldogs in some ways. Stockton has been a part of that, with Bennett saying the Tiger, Georgia native is among his favorite players to watch.\n\n\"They've gotten better as time has gone on and early in the season,\" Bennett said. \"They got battle tested but you see moments like that 4th & 6 pass Gunner threw against Tennessee. The scratching and fighting and clawing and figuring out a way to get it done when they had to.\"\n\nBennett will have his eyes closely locked on the Sugar Bowl matchup between Georgia and Ole Miss on Thursday evening. He couldn't be more confident in a quarterback who has been pinned by some as the next \"Stetson Bennett\" already.\n\n\"Just trying to go out there and do the best that you can for your team. It looks like Gunner has been doing that all year, and I can't wait to watch him continue doing that.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Draft Wire: Stetson Bennett 'totally agrees' with Gunner Stockton comparison",

    "title": "Notable quotes from Dan Lanning's presser after shutout vs. Texas Tech",
    "description": "Oregon Ducks head coach Dan Lanning met with media members to break down his team's win over the Texas Tech Red Raiders in the CFP Quarterfinals.",
    "fullText": "It may have taken an entire calendar year, but the Oregon Ducks finally exorcised their demons from last year with a win in the College Football Playoff Quarterfinals. They manhandled the Texas Tech Red Raiders in a 23-0 shutout, where the Big-12 champions’ top-10 offense was dismantled.\n\nDan Lanning was visibly frustrated with his team’s defense after their win in the first round of the playoffs, so it makes sense why the unit put together such an inspired performance. The same couldn’t be said for the offense, who only had 16 points total before a garbage-time touchdown inflated the stats slightly.\n\nWhile there are still things to improve upon, it should make the Ducks feel good that they can be so dominant while playing far below their potential. They are just two wins away from being immortalized as champions. Let’s look at what Lanning had to say about that prospect and the win today over Texas Tech.\n\nLanning: Unbelievable game. A lot of fun. We've talked to our guys about being battle tested all year and having to win in different ways. That game went back and forth in a lot of ways, struggled at times to go score points, and our defense did an unbelievable job getting the ball back. And then our offense showed up when it mattered most at the end of the game. I think we out-physicaled our opponent at the end. A lot of respect for Coach McGuire and the team that he's had. This shouldn't discredit them. I remember this feeling last year when you have a really good team, you play really good football all year, and then it comes to an end. And that's the way it is for every team but one. Certainly grateful for our fans and excited to see them show up in Atlanta.\n\nQ: What did you make of the hype surrounding Texas Tech’s defense before this game?\n\nLanning: Yeah, we thought they were. They are a good defense. Their performance today, I think it showed it. You walk into halftime, it's 6-0, that's a great indicator of them being a good defense. And they had some guys that played some really good ball. We just felt like in this moment it was going to be about chipping away and eventually it was going to break. It kind of broke open with us creating some extra opportunities there with takeaways, opportunities on special teams. I thought our special teams played really, really well.\n\nBut we had a lot of respect for Texas Tech's defense. They don't play the way they've played all year and not be good. And they are. They're good. We thought it would be about explosive plays. There weren't a ton of explosive plays in this game really for either side. But the physicality showed up for our guys down the stretch.\n\nQ: How were you able to shut down the Red Raiders’ passing attack?\n\nLanning: Definitely it starts with players like Brandon. I think Brandon would tell you the same thing. It's about 11 guys executing, and that's how you get an opportunity to create plays like that. I think when we pull up this film and we watch it, we're going to see 11 guys playing the same call. We knew their tempo would be an issue. So ultimately we wanted to be able to get the call in fast and let our guys line up. I thought we did a really good job of that.\n\nI thought Coach Lupoi did a great job of calling the game, and our defensive coaches preparing them. I felt like it was probably faster in practice than it was in the game, which is ultimately what we wanted. And then we knew their strengths. They've been really good at completing shots down the field. They've had a really good screen game. Those are things that we really prepared for and worked really hard for, and guys like Brandon showed up.\n\nQ: Can you speak about your mindset on going for it in fourth down?\n\nLanning: Well, it worked sometimes and didn't work sometimes. So I assume all the times it didn't work I'm stupid and all the times it worked I'm smart. That's kind of how it works. I feel like -- we talked about it at halftime. We made some adjustments. They were playing really good 4th down defense, and we decided, hey, let's take the points in the second half. But I think that's our mindset. We make those decisions early in the week, and I certainly trust our offense. They ran a really tough defensive call for what we called down there in the red area. That's one that you wish you had back, say we could have took the points there. But points are never guaranteed. We missed a field goal, too.\n\nBut I felt good about -- we had an early look on punt and felt like we were going to have a look at the punt fake. That was an opportunity to go be aggressive. And just felt like ultimately, if you limit the opportunities for their offense to be on the field, you were going to increase the opportunities for us to go score and them not to, and that showed up today.\n\nQ: What is the challenges of defending a player like David Bailey?\n\nLanning: They've got good players, man. They've got really good players. They've got a great front. Ultimately they rushed the passer really, really well. I'm excited to evaluate the film and say how can we shore that up. I think there's going to be some small things that we can attack and make better. There's some plays we were really efficient at today, and then there were some plays that weren't. When you have a player like David Bailey, when you have players that you're going to see in the College Football Playoff, you've got to have a plan for them. At times our plan was really good, and then there was some times that we could certainly improve that.\n\nQ: Can you speak about Brandon Finney Jr.’s interception in the end zone?\n\nLanning: It's a strategic play. He did it exactly like we asked him to do. We tell him to play low to high down in the red area. He did exactly that. He played low until the player was able to show up and take away the low and then he creeped to high, and he made an outstanding play. I was just as impressed with the fact took a knee after he caught it.\n\nQ: What are your thoughts on not having a first-round bye?\n\nLanning: I guess it works, right? I've been a proponent for games to be happening much quicker for a long time. I think that's best for college football. Again, I felt like this game -- the Orange Bowl, first off, was unbelievable. I should have really given kudos to the Orange Bowl because it's been a great experience, but it's not the same bowl experience anymore when you talk about playoffs. Our guys didn't leave the hotel. They had a mindset that we can celebrate when this thing is all over with and they were really focused, but the hospitality here was unbelievable.\n\nBut we're trying to serve two different purposes here, and this is a playoff. A playoff in my opinion should have been played in Lubbock, Texas. I've said that before. That's not because we wanted to go play in Lubbock; I certainly didn't. I'm glad we played here in Miami, and it was good prep for us, but last year very similar situation for us. I feel like that game should have been played in Eugene. There's a lot of people that do playoffs. I feel like the playoffs have looked a certain way for a long time, and we're trying to serve two purposes here. The amount of time in between games, obviously, is tough for teams. We experienced it last year.\n\nQ: What will the next 24 hours look like for your team after this win?\n\nLanning: Well, it's going to start with about a five-hour flight, five-and-a-half-hour flight, but we'll be watching film on the way back, start trying to evaluate the opponents that we could potentially play. Hopefully we get some wi-fi up there in the air and we can flip on a game and check it out. But it always starts with us. That's where we're going to go back and look at this game and say, okay, what did we do really well. Let's go to the doctor, let's figure out what kind of medicine we've got to take for the next game because I think that's always the greatest indicator of what you have to improve, when you start to analyze what you have in front of you. Then we'll have kind of a bonus day here tomorrow and then we'll hop right into a normal week prep, Sunday prep. I don't even know what day today is. Today is Saturday in my mind. But we'll get a bonus day, and then it'll be Sunday the next day.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Top quotes from Dan Lanning after CFP win vs. Texas Tech Red Raiders",

    "fullText": "What's next for Alabama? Explaining questions surrounding Kalen DeBoer, Ty Simpson and more in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlabama's 2025 season came to an anticlimactic end on Thursday afternoon. The Tide fell 38-3 to the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers, in one of the worst playoff appearances for Alabama in recent years.\n\nAlthough the Tide managed to beat Oklahoma in the first round, losing by 28 points in the quarterfinal puts a sour end to the year. The three points Alabama put up is the lowest output since in its six appearances in the CFP era.\n\nNow that the book is closed on Alabama's 2025-26 season, let's take a look at what's next for head coach Kalen Deboer, quarterback Ty Simpson and the rest of the Tide in 2026.\n\nMORE:Lowest scoring Alabama games in CFP history\n\nThat likely depends on what incumbent Ty Simpson decides to do. The signal-caller's season was cut short against Indiana in the Rose Bowl. After taking a big hit that forced a fumble late in the second quarter, Tide head coach Kalen DeBoer benched him.\n\nThe decision appeared to be at least partly medical, as early in the second half, ESPN sideline reporter Kris Budden reported that while Simpson was trying to warm up, coaches determined he was not healthy enough to return to the game.\n\nSimpson is a redshirt junior who backed up both Bryce Young and Jalen Milroe in Tuscaloosa. He is eligible for the 2026 NFL Draft and could declare. The NFL Mock Draft database projects Simpson as a first-round pick, going No. 20 overall to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nSimpson, who threw for 3,500 yards with 28 touchdowns and five interceptions this season, had a strong first year as a starter. You could make the case for him to go pro, but you also can’t blame him for returning to Tuscaloosa to get another full season under his belt and possibly improve his draft stock, which dipped due to his late-season struggles.\n\nIf Simpson does leave, the Tide have a few options at quarterback. His backup is Austin Mack, who initially played under DeBoer at Washington. The former 4-star quarterback prospect out of Folsom, Calif., originally signed with the Huskies' 2023 class before following DeBoer to Tuscaloosa. After Simpson’s injury, Mack had a modest debut, going 11-of-16 for 103 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.\n\nAlabama also has former 5-star quarterback Keelon Russell from its 2025 class, and the Tide signed 4-star quarterback Jeff Thomalia to its 2026 recruiting class.\n\nMORE:Why Alabama QB Ty Simpson was pulled from Rose Bowl\n\nAs of now, it appears that Williams will remain with the Tide. In the days leading up to the Rose Bowl, he told  AL.com that he's \"Alabama through and through.\" He added that he has \"no intentions of being anywhere else.\"\n\n\"I had a lot of ups, people considered last year, and just learning how to deal with those, and I've had a lot of downs, people considered this year, and I've learned how to deal with those,\" Williams told ESPN at media day before the Rose Bowl. \"Really just an opportunity to stay human and have empathy for others, because I've been through some things. It's been a blessing to go through all the ups, all the downs, all the arounds.\"\n\nWilliams being speculated to transfer isn't too much of a surprise. He had a breakout season as a true freshman in 2024, getting 48 receptions 865 yards with eight touchdowns last season. But in 2025, Williams finished with just 43 receptions for 643 yards and four touchdowns. The sophomore is second nationally in highest percentage of drops (14.3) with 10 on the season.\n\nMORE:Indiana, Curt Cignetti shred rest vs. rust narrative in Rose Bowl\n\nKalen DeBoer is in his second season with Alabama, compiling a 20-8 record with the Tide over two seasons.\n\nDespite the impressive record and a playoff appearance this season, it hasn't all been sunshine and roses with the head coach and Alabama fans from the jump. In fact, it's been a roller coaster. DeBoer appeared to be on the hot seat after Alabama’s 2024 finish, which came in just his first season at the helm. The Tide seemed on track for a College Football Playoff bid last season, with one-score losses to Vanderbilt and Tennessee entering late November.\n\nThat changed with an embarrassing 24-3 road loss to Oklahoma on Nov. 23, which knocked Alabama out of playoff contention. The Tide then fell 19-13 to Michigan in the ReliaQuest Bowl to finish 9-4. Alabama opened the 2025 season with a 31-17 Week 1 road loss to Florida State.\n\nDeBoer worked his way back into fans’ good graces as the season progressed. Alabama beat then-No. 5 Georgia 24-21 on the road Sept. 27, then added wins over ranked Vanderbilt, Missouri and Tennessee. The Tide later lost 23-21 on the road to Oklahoma but rebounded with a win over Auburn to clinch a spot in the SEC championship game.\n\nAgainst Georgia in Atlanta, Alabama turned in an abysmal performance. In the 28-7 loss, the Tide were held to minus-3 rushing yards and just 209 yards of total offense, finishing 3-for-14 on third down. The showing was so poor that many expected Alabama to be left out of the CFP.\n\nInstead, the committee awarded Alabama a bid, and the Tide went on the road to face Oklahoma. Despite falling behind 17-0 early, they stormed back to win 34-24, briefly restoring DeBoer in Alabama fans' good graces. However, the 38-3 Rose Bowl loss quickly erased that goodwill. If Alabama gets off to a slow start in 2026, DeBoer will likely be under intense scrutiny again.\n\nTide fans’ fickle opinions are a big reason DeBoer was linked to the open Penn State and Michigan jobs. Expect his name to surface again in the 2026 coaching carousel if things remain unsteady in Tuscaloosa. With Thursday's loss, DeBoer's Alabama teams have dropped to 0-7 when trailing at halftime.\n\nHere's a look at Alabama's schedule for 2026:\n\nMORE:Worst Alabama losses: Where Rose Bowl defeat vs. Indiana ranks",

A loss would send the Steelers home.\n\nMany are viewing this game as a referendum of sorts on Mike Tomlin, the long-time head coach.\n\nBut would the Steelers fire him?\n\n\"Not according to his contract or franchise precedent -- or to the players in the locker room,\" ESPN's Brooke Pryor wrote this week.\n\nA loss could start to send the Steelers in a changing direction, though.\n\n\"Tomlin, 53, has two years left on his contract: 2026 and a club option for 2027 set to be determined by March 1,\" Pryor writes. \"The Steelers have also had only three head coaches since 1969.

    "description": "While speaking with NJ Advance Media's Cayden Steele, Mailata hinted at an early retirement, but only after he finds his replacement.",
    "fullText": "Jordan Mailata's story with the Eagles isn't quite rags to riches. Still, the All-Pro left tackle has improved drastically year by year since Philadelphia selected the former Australian Rugby Player in the late rounds of the 2018 NFL draft. Since then, Mailata, 28, has developed into one of the NFL's most efficient and highest graded left tackles.\n\nMailata, like Jason Kelce before him, has taken on a mentor role in the Eagles' locker room, and like the former All-Pro center, Mailata will play a role in finding his eventual successor. While speaking with NJ Advance Media's Cayden Steele, Mailata hinted at an early retirement, but only after he finds his replacement.\n\n“I care a lot, man,” Mailata said. “I care a lot because I only have so long to play this game, man. Everyone’s like, ‘Oh, you can play another five years.’ Yeah, bulls---. I’m already in the phase of bringing the next guy along with me. Who’s it gonna be? I can’t tell you, but it’s a high standard playing in this city, so just gotta keep that going. And for me it’s just, I want the best for those boys. I am always going to root for the underdog.”\n\n“In a sense, I’d feel a type of way,” Mailata said about not finding his replacement before retirement. “You just want to leave it in a good place. Leave it as you found it.”\n\nWith the help of Lane Johnson and offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, Mailata has become the face of the NFL's International Pathway Program. Mailata's 83.8 overall grade from PFF is the 8th best in the NFL, while his 81.2 pass blocking grade is eighth as well.\n\nMailata has allowed two sacks in 972 pass block snaps.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Jordan Mailata has started to scout his likely successor with Eagles",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox are reportedly looking to add another bat and could pursue one of the top hitters.\n\nBoston has continued to show interest in bringing back Alex Bregman, but the team has also shown interest in Bo Bichette. Now, MLB.com’s analyst Jared Greenspan and Theo DeRosa linked the Red Sox to Eugenio Suarez if the team can’t land either Bregman or Bichette.\n\n“Boston could still use another impact bat,” the two wrote in an article published on Thursday. “Among the top remaining free-agent hitters, shortstop Bo Bichette and outfielders Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger aren’t the most natural fits for the Red Sox.\n\n“But re-signing third baseman Alex Bregman would be an obvious move. If Bregman signs elsewhere, slugger Eugenio Suarez could be a fallback option.”\n\nSuarez would be an impact bat for Boston and could play third base and hit in the middle of the order. The slugger split last season between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Seattle Mariners, and he hit 49 home runs with 118 RBIs. The 49 home runs tied his career-high back in 2019.\n\nThe Red Sox have also been linked to Ketel Marte in trade talks, but it’s uncertain if the Diamondbacks will move him.\n\nRegardless of who it ends up being, adding a bat is likely the priority for the Red Sox after shoring up their pitching staff this offseason.\n\nSo far this offseason, Boston has acquired first baseman Willson Contreras and pitchers Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo in three separate trades.\n\nRed Sox Fans Shouldn’t Forget About These Two Vital Extensions",

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes, Indiana’s defense thoroughly throttled Alabama, and the top-seeded Hoosiers roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 38-3 victory in the 112th Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nMendoza passed for 192 yards in his first game since winning his school’s first Heisman Trophy, but the hard-nosed Hoosiers (14-0, No. 1 CFP seed) won the Rose Bowl for the first time in school history by dominating the Crimson Tide (11-4, No. 9 CFP seed) at the line of scrimmage.\n\nIndiana scored the game’s first 24 points before pouring it on with fourth-quarter rushing TDs from Kaelon Black and Roman Hemby, wrapping up a jubilant win in the 112th edition of the Granddaddy of Them All.\n\nCharlie Becker, Omar Cooper Jr. and Elijah Sarratt caught TD passes, while Black rushed for 99 yards. Indiana outgained Alabama 407-193, steadily delighting a decidedly pro-Indiana crowd that celebrated its long-struggling team’s first Rose Bowl game appearance since 1968 with chants of “Hoosier Daddy?” in the final minutes.\n\nIndiana had not won any bowl game since the Copper Bowl in 1991, but history has been no match for Curt Cignetti and his dominant Hoosiers during the coach’s two transcendent seasons.\n\nThe Hoosiers are headed to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9 for a CFP semifinal rematch with fifth-seeded Oregon, which routed Texas Tech 23-0 earlier Thursday in the Orange Bowl. Indiana beat the then-No. 3 Ducks 30-20 in Eugene last October in one of Cignetti’s most impressive Big Ten victories.\n\nIndiana is two wins away from the first national championship in school history after becoming the first team to advance following a first-round bye in the current 12-team playoff format. The first six bye teams — including the first two this season — couldn’t come back strong from an extra-long layoff, but the Hoosiers took care of business while improving to 25-2 under Cignetti.\n\nThe Crimson Tide’s second season under Kalen DeBoer ended in the same venue as their final season under Nick Saban two years ago. Alabama was outclassed one week after an impressive road win over Oklahoma, managing just 151 yards before the meaningless final minutes of this blowout.\n\nTy Simpson passed for 67 yards before backup Austin Mack replaced him in the third quarter. Mack immediately got the Tide rolling on a 65-yard drive leading to a short field goal, but the Hoosiers responded with two unstoppable TD drives.\n\nIndiana dominated the famous Rose Bowl turf, which stayed pristine despite nearly 24 hours of steady rain before kickoff. The storms dissipated while the Hoosiers took their first-half lead, and blue skies appeared in the second half.\n\nAfter the first scoreless first quarter in a Rose Bowl in 26 years, Indiana’s second drive stretched 84 yards and 16 plays over nearly nine minutes before Nicolas Radicic’s 31-yard field goal on the first snap of the second quarter.\n\nIndiana’s defense then stopped Alabama on fourth and 1 at the Tide 34, and Mendoza fired a long, high pass to the leaping Becker four plays later for a 21-yard touchdown.\n\nSimpson fumbled in Indiana territory after a courageous first-down scramble late in the first half, and the Hoosiers methodically drove for Mendoza’s 1-yard TD pass with 17 seconds left to Cooper, the hero of Indiana’s dramatic victory over Penn State.\n\nAfter halftime, Mendoza led a steady 79-yard drive ending in his 24-yard TD pass to the leaping Sarratt.\n\nThe victory is the latest step in the monumental two-season turnaround of what was the losingest program in college football when Cignetti took charge. After winning 11 games and reaching the CFP last season, the Hoosiers steamrolled through their schedule this fall before beating defending national champion Ohio State for the Big Ten title and ascending to the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 for the first time.\n\nAlabama: It was remarkable to see the most successful program of the 21st century get dominated up front. The Tide’s inability to run the ball was a season-long problem, but it was particularly painful in Pasadena. Whether through personnel or scheme, DeBoer’s offense must take a step forward next year to reach the standard expected at Bama.\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers acted like they’ve been here before, even though they haven’t. Cignetti’s group has a businesslike demeanor that wasn’t remotely altered by Alabama’s reputation and history.\n\nAlabama: Host East Carolina on Sept. 5.\n\nIndiana: A trip to Atlanta to face the powerhouse Ducks, who lost last season’s Rose Bowl to Ohio State as the No. 1 seed.",

    "title": "Trevon Diggs relieved for fresh start, confident he'll make impact with Packers: 'I still feel like I'm the best'",
    "description": "Diggs is optimistic about the opportunity and adjusting to life in Green Bay — he's got a friend in Micah Parsons helping him make the transition.",
    "fullText": "As the saying goes, \"new year, new me.\" It's a timely one for new Green Bay Packers cornerback Trevon Diggs, who was claimed off waivers Wednesday after being released by the Dallas Cowboys Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm not chasing accolades. I'm not chasing anything,\" Diggs told reporters Thursday, New Year's Day, before adding, \"I'm chasing being a better me, being better every day, helping this team win.\"\n\nThe Cowboys moved on from Diggs just two years after signing the two-time Pro Bowl corner to a five-year, $97 million extension.\n\nTrevon Diggs on the level of player he thinks he is:\n\n“Still feel like I’m the best.”\n\nHis locker is three down from Micah Parsons, who he called right after learning the Packers claimed him.\n\n“He told me it’s work, it’s a lot different and he said I’m gonna like it a lot.” pic.twitter.com/9zun21Ougo\n\n— Matt Schneidman (@mattschneidman) January 1, 2026\n\nCowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer said Diggs' release resulted from a \"culmination of multiple factors,\" one of which was the Maryland native straying from protocol and not flying back to Dallas with the team after its Christmas Day road win over the Washington Commanders. Diggs had asked Schottenheimer if he could stay in the D.C. area to see family, but Schottenheimer turned down Diggs, just as he said he rejected requests from other players who had asked to fly separately that week.\n\n\"It was one of many factors,\" Schottenheimer said Wednesday, per ESPN. \"It was not the only factor. I'm not the Grinch that stole Christmas. I love Christmas. I love my family. But at the end of the day, we have a protocol that we go through, and the process was not followed.\"\n\nAnother factor Schottenheimer mentioned was Diggs' performance. After piling up 17 interceptions across his first three seasons in the NFL, including a league-leading 11 as a first-team All-Pro in 2021, the 2020 second-round pick from Alabama has tallied just three picks over the past three seasons.\n\nThis time around, the 27-year-old Diggs has played in eight games and, according to Pro Football Focus, is currently allowing a perfect 158.3 passer rating when targeted. Vocal about his frustration with the Cowboys' defensive scheme this season, he's given up 16 catches on 20 targets for 286 yards and three touchdowns without a single pass break-up or interception, per PFF.\n\nDespite those meager metrics, Diggs still has the confidence of a CB1.\n\n\"I still feel like I'm the best,\" he said Thursday.\n\nInjuries disrupted the brilliant start to his Cowboys career. During practice early in the 2023 campaign, Diggs tore the ACL in his left knee. That injury cost him most of that season.\n\nHe made his way back for the 2024 season, although he later missed time with a groin injury and then was shut down for the year to have another surgery on his left knee.\n\nDiggs was sidelined while rehabbing this past offseason, including during training camp leading up to a Week 1 return that Packers edge rusher Micah Parsons, one of Diggs' close friends, criticized the Cowboys for mismanaging.\n\nDiggs suffered a concussion in October because of an accident at home. A TV that he was trying to mount fell on his head, as reported by NFL Network's Jane Slater last month. Also that month, he was placed on injured reserve due to a right knee injury that had lingered this fall.\n\nHe didn't return until Week 16. By that point, the Cowboys were already eliminated from postseason contention. Diggs said Thursday that he's healthy, joked that he'll be using Taskrabbit for his handyman work from now on and emphasized that he's grateful to be in position to help a contender like the playoff-bound Packers.\n\n\"It's been a great feeling,\" Diggs said. \"They believe in me. I believe in myself, and I'm ready. It's going to be fun.\"\n\nDiggs said he got the call that he was headed to the Packers Wednesday just as he was about to take his kids to Dave & Buster's.\n\nThe trip was tabled, but the moment was celebrated.\n\nThen Diggs contacted Parsons, whom the Cowboys traded to the Packers in late August after an infamous contract standoff.\n\n\"Yeah, I called him right away,\" Diggs said of Parsons. \"He's super excited for me, super happy for me. We have a great relationship — our families, our moms, everyone is real close, so it all worked out.\"\n\nParsons, now a five-time Pro Bowler, logged 12.5 sacks in his first 14 games with Green Bay, however, a torn ACL in Week 15 cut his inaugural Packers campaign short.\n\nWhile the sack artist won't be on the field with Diggs this season, they now share a locker room again. Parsons has offered Diggs a place to crash and a car to drive. He's also provided the corner with some insight about playing for the Packers.\n\n\"He told me it's work. It's a lot different,\" Diggs said. \"He said I'm going to like it a lot, and I'm going to enjoy it. So far I've been enjoying it a lot.\n\n\"My first day was out there today, and I had a lot of fun, and it's a great thing to be here.\"\n\nDiggs admitted that blocking out all the noise surrounding him recently has been a challenge. He's focused on moving forward in the New Year.\n\n\"I want to be here as long as they want me to be here, for sure,\" he said. \"I like it here a lot. I got relationships here already, and I would love to call this place home.\"",

    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins have brought in Hall-of-Fame QB and ESPN analyst Troy Aikman as a consultant to assist with their search for a general manager, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. The three-time Super Bowl champion’s role will not be permanent; he will serve as an advisor throughout the process of finding the Dolphins’ next GM.\n\nDespite Aikman’s lack of front-office experience, it is common for teams to bring in new perspectives when seeking new leadership. Former Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers served as a key advisor during the Washington Commanders' coaching search.\n\nFormer New England Patriots quarterback and Fox analyst Tom Brady has also served as an advisor to Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis in his role as a minority owner.\n\nBrady has assisted the Raiders with insights on football operations, player acquisitions, and their coaching search. Brady has been criticized for having a conflict of interest with his role as a broadcaster and a team owner.\n\nThe biggest difference between Aikman’s role and Brady’s is that Aikman does not have ownership of the team, and his position is temporary. Aikman’s role with the Dolphins will end once they have found their next GM.\n\nIn October, the Dolphins and former general manager Chris Grier decided to mutually part ways after the team’s 2-7 start. Grier had been the general manager since 2016, leading the team to five winning seasons and three playoff appearances during his tenure.\n\nThe new GM will need to work with Dolphins owner Stephen Ross to determine the future direction of the team. The first order of business will be deciding whether head coach Mike McDaniel and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa will remain with the team next year.\n\nMcDaniel is 35–34 as the Dolphins’ head coach and has missed the playoffs in the last two seasons. Tagovailoa is coming off his worst season as a starting quarterback. McDaniel’s contract runs through the 2028 season.\n\nTagovailoa’s 15 interceptions are the second-worst in the NFL, and he was benched for seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers. Tagovailoa signed a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension, which is set to run through the 2028 season.",

    "title": "The year of unaffordability",
    "description": "2025 was marked by rising prices. Fortunately, classical liberalism offers the resources we need to overcome the crisis.",
    "fullText": "As 2025 draws to a close, American politics ends where it began: the affordability crisis is at the top of the agenda. Housing, healthcare, childcare, education, and even electricity in some places all seem to be slipping further out of ordinary reach, even as the economy continues to grow.\n\nClassical liberalism offers a straightforward diagnosis and an equally straightforward cure. Remove unnecessary regulations that constrict supply and withdraw subsidies that artificially inflate demand! Yet the year has also provided familiar public choice stories about the obstacles to these sensible solutions. Concentrated interests profit from regulation and subsidies, but their costs are thinly dispersed across millions of consumers. The Trump administration’s renewed push for deregulation offers a glimmer of hope, but 2025 illustrates both the generative power of liberty and the political obstacles from past incursions on our freedoms.\n\nAt bottom, the affordability issue reflects the failure of wages to keep pace with prices. Given that incomes in the United States have generally been increasing, affordability is not a fundamentally macroeconomic problem of stimulating greater economic growth, although, of course, growth would be beneficial. It is, instead, a microeconomic problem in which prices in essential sectors such as housing, medicine, education, and parts of agriculture continue to rise much faster than inflation. What do these sectors have in common? Government intervention in the form of price controls, subsidies, or both. In areas where the government is absent, prices for technological goods or home-delivered household goods through online platforms such as Amazon are decreasing, quality is increasing, or both.\n\nThus, the classical liberal solution to this year’s economic crisis is more of the old-time religion: free markets, open competition, and the elimination of subsidies, particularly to those who are not poor. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. Restrictions on market entry benefit incumbents, who have greater influence with politicians than unorganized entrants. Subsidies drive up prices. But, of course, those enjoying the subsidies have every interest in retaining them. The effect of subsidies on prices is just an economic argument, but for the recipient, the subsidy appears as money in the bank. It is thus unsurprising that they are challenging to eliminate. Political scientists have long observed that legislation tends to deliver concentrated benefits and diffuse costs, even if the diffuse costs far exceed the benefits.\n\nIt is a striking confirmation of the grip of this political truth that the Democratic Party chose to make the administration’s failure to extend new healthcare subsidies the issue on which it shut down the federal government. Moreover, the government’s perennial inability to end any “free” government money was underscored by the fact that these subsidies had originally been sold as a short-term solution to the pandemic and that some of them go to families earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. According to prevailing political consensus, the Democrats won the shutdown with their tactical maneuver, and their opponents, while in the legislative majority, have struggled to develop a politically feasible response.\n\nYet these subsidies increase the cost of healthcare and insurance by making consumers less price-conscious. One solution is to subsidize health insurance only for catastrophic medical events among the poor, rather than day-to-day care for the middle class. Yet, of course, the insurance companies, whose profits are padded by subsidized sign-ups from whatever sources, strongly oppose any such reform.\n\nAnd health insurance is not the only government distortion of the market for medical care. There are numerous supply-side restrictions. Licensing regimes restrict the use of nonphysician providers, and certification-of-need requirements delay the entry of new hospitals, yet doctors and incumbent hospitals benefit from government regulations. The FDA is a barrier for many new drug candidates. Medical care is thus not only a poster child for the affordability crisis but also for government dysfunction.\n\nThe other area most discussed in affordability is housing. Again, developments in 2025 indicate that it will be challenging to reduce housing costs through deregulation. Just as the government shutdown was the most striking federal political event, the most striking local one was the election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City. Not surprisingly for a self-proclaimed socialist, his policies are the opposite of the classical liberal program. He ran on a platform to address affordability through price controls and subsidies, specifically draconian rent controls, as well as “free” childcare and buses.\n\nGiven that bad government regulation is at the heart of the affordability crisis, the most effective antidote is deregulation.\n\nHis platform is more proof of the power of public choice analysis. Economists across the political spectrum oppose rent control because it reduces the housing stock over the long run and disincentivizes housing supply. It is thus a policy that undermines affordability rather than promotes it. Nevertheless, rent control remains politically popular. There are more tenants than landlords, and those who are prevented from moving into the city do not have the right to vote in municipal elections.\n\nThe classical liberal solution would be the opposite. Eliminate rent controls and increase housing supply by weakening zoning regulations. Unfortunately, the latter is almost as unpopular as the former because homeowners benefit from restricted entry that keeps housing prices high, particularly in New York City, where soaring prices make homeowners’ homes a disproportionate share of their net worth.\n\nThe childcare subsidies will raise effective costs, as providers increase their prices to the same extent as colleges have, given government grants and low-cost loans. A better solution would be to deregulate childcare, allowing providers to operate from their own homes, as they did in earlier centuries.\n\nMedicine, housing, and childcare are only a few of the sectors in which the government restricts price competition. For instance, obstructive licensing regimes have impeded infrastructure development. Moreover, some of these impediments have increased energy costs by delaying pipeline construction and the expansion of the electric grid.\n\nGiven that bad government regulation is at the heart of the affordability crisis, the most effective antidote is deregulation. Thus, the most significant source of optimism for classical liberals in 2025 was the Trump administration’s domestic deregulatory agenda. Most importantly, the Trump administration has made substantial changes to the overall regulatory structure. It has emphasized regulatory budgeting and required the deregulation of ten rules for every new rule issued. It has mandated that new regulations be issued, or existing ones survive, only if they are based on the best reading of the statute, thereby suggesting that the administration will reconsider regulations grounded in overly aggressive readings that supported expansive regulation.\n\nIt has also pursued sector-by-sector deregulation. Particularly notable are those that seek to remove regulatory barriers to energy production and to roll back requirements that mandate the production of electric vehicles by automakers. In education, it is moving to allow greater choice among accreditors, making it easier for schools to secure approval for innovative and cost-reducing ideas. It has also focused on deregulating financial services and securities regulation, including crypto, to stimulate capital markets. The more efficient capital markets are, the easier it is for upstarts to challenge incumbents, increasing competition and reducing prices.\n\nNevertheless, many of the regulatory bottlenecks underlying the affordability crisis are at the state and local levels. For instance, the federal government has limited power to influence zoning and state permitting regulations that make new housing expensive to build. Nor can the federal government eliminate the pernicious and growing local rent control.\n\nFortunately, the administration’s focus on deregulating artificial intelligence, an initiative I have discussed before as a mechanism for boosting economic growth, is also likely to address affordability problems caused by the regulation at all levels of government. One of AI’s promises of affordability is that it can reduce regulatory compliance costs, which function as entry barriers, shielding incumbents and pushing smaller firms out of markets altogether. Moreover, AI can reduce costs for diffuse groups, such as consumers seeking to organize against special interests, and publicize the costs of regulation, thereby exerting political pressure for regulatory simplification or elimination.\n\nTake my own field of law. Software is far less effective than AI-enabled online companies at providing low-cost legal assistance for routine legal documents, such as wills and powers of attorney. When the lawyers’ guild argued that such aid was illegal as the unauthorized practice of law, our words of decentralized media helped build pressure in states like Texas to exempt these new practices from such legal prohibitions. Thus, technology can both cut the cost of providing expert advice and reduce the barriers that protect incumbents from competition.\n\nThus, the rise of artificial intelligence will help address the affordability crisis, at least initially, by reducing fixed compliance costs, weakening entry barriers, and assisting diffuse interests in organizing against regulatory excess. But that same promise will invite efforts to convert the legitimate needs for “AI safety” into the next regulatory moat.\n\nWhether AI can continue to improve affordability depends on which impulse prevails. Will it be the use of innovative technologies to expand competition and supply, or their capture by incumbents seeking new protection? History suggests no final victory. The struggle for affordability is never finished because it is essentially a struggle for liberty. It must be renewed generation by generation.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has publicly humiliated his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt by contradicting her repeated reassurances and excuses about his health woes.\n\nSince Trump, 79, returned to office last January, speculation has raged over bruising on his hands and about his cognitive ability, particularly after he underwent a mystery scan in the fall—with the Daily Beast leading the way on reporting the president’s various medical issues, including his swollen cankles.\n\nLeavitt, 28, has repeatedly claimed the reason for the discoloration on the back of his right hand—which the president has covered up with band-aids, bandages, and thick make-up—is that as “a man of the people,” Trump “meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nWhile Leavitt has also attributed the bruising to the president’s routine aspirin use, she has often led her responses to questions about Trump’s hands by blaming his handshaking, including when questioned on the matter earlier this month by the Beast’s political correspondent Farrah Tomazin.\n\n“The president is literally constantly shaking hands, the Oval Office is like Grand Central Terminal,” she explained earlier this month.\n\nDays after the bruising appeared to spread to Trump’s left hand—which he does not use to greet people—the president on Thursday gave a revelatory interview about his health to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump offered a different reason for the bruising: overuse of aspirin and his thinning skin.\n\nHe told the Journal that he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin a day—four times the 81-milligram “low dose” commonly used in daily therapy, per the Mayo Clinic—despite conceding his doctors have urged him to take less.\n\nThis higher-than-recommended aspirin use, Trump said, has become a central factor in the bruising that’s been spotted on his hands. But he told the outlet he refuses to reduce the dose because he’s been on the same routine for decades, and is “a little superstitious.”\n\nTrump also said he wears makeup because he has soft skin, and it bruises when it gets “whacked.”\n\nDiscussing an episode in which Attorney General Pam Bondi, 60, nicked him during a high-five, he told the Journal: “The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut.”\n\nHe added that he puts makeup on his hands after he gets “whacked again by someone,” saying: “I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds.”\n\nTrump also gave more details about his October scan, further embarrassing Leavitt, who has fended off repeated inquiries about it from the White House podium.\n\nShe at first repeatedly answered questions without naming the test and leaning on scripted assurances about his condition. On October 23, she declined to specify what test he received. On November 4, pressed on why Trump had a week earlier described it as an MRI, she said she would “check back,” while insisting he was in “optimal physical health” and framing the Walter Reed visit as a routine follow-up.\n\nWhen asked again on November 12, Leavitt leaned on the language of the doctor’s memo, reiterating that Trump received “advanced imaging” as part of a routine exam and that physicians considered him in “exceptional” condition, without explaining why the imaging was ordered.\n\nLeavitt’s position remained the same until December 1, when Trump’s physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, released a memo describing cardiovascular imaging. Leavitt told reporters the screening was normal and positioned the disclosure as transparency.\n\nEven then, the White House’s preferred shorthand remained “advanced imaging,” rather than a clear, consistent label for what Trump had undergone.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Trump said he’d been telling people it was an MRI, but then corrected it: “It wasn’t an MRI… It was less than that. It was a scan.” He complained that getting the test had handed critics “ammunition” because it fueled questions about whether something was wrong.\n\nThe Journal reported that Trump and Barbabella ultimately characterized the procedure as a CT scan performed to rule out cardiovascular issues, with no abnormalities found.\n\nLeavitt is quoted in the Journal saying the White House had “often referred to the procedure as ‘advanced imaging,’” while not addressing why Trump didn’t correct the MRI/CT description sooner.\n\nIn the Journal article, Trump also discussed his ‘cankles’ and why he apparently cannot stay awake during public meetings.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and Leavitt for comment.",

    "description": "\"Customers are asked to return this product to their nearest store.\"",
    "fullText": "Nothing dampens the holiday spirit more than an unexpected bout of allergies. Unfortunately, a Christmas-themed product from Aldi might've left some customers with more than a bad taste in their mouths.\n\nThe Independent reported that the U.K. supermarket chain recalled Perfect Christmas Mozzarella Sticks in Blankets from its stores. This product contains egg, which wasn't listed on the packaging.\n\n\"Customers are asked to return this product to their nearest store, where a full refund will be given,\" Aldi wrote in the recall notice. \"We apologise that this product did not meet our normal high standards and thank you for your co-operation.\"\n\nThe affected product was sold in 278-gram (about 9.8-ounce) packages with a use-by date of December 15. The U.K. Food Standards Agency (FSA) urged consumers with allergies or intolerance to eggs to return the product instead of rolling the dice.\n\nCustomers can make good on Aldi's refund, in any case. Aldi also informed customers that they could receive more information via a phone number or on help.aldi.co.uk.\n\nLabel accuracy is crucial for managing food intolerance and allergies. When companies fail to list allergens, consumers must depend on others for accurate information.\n\nSomeone with an egg allergy could have a serious reaction when they were simply trying to enjoy some seasonal mozz sticks. You can imagine the potential consequences, including a possible trip to the hospital.\n\nEggs are one of the 14 allergens the FSA requires to be declared, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers them one of the \"Big 9\" allergies that are leading causes of reactions and symptoms.\n\nFood recalls often highlight broader concerns in the food production industry, including a lack of oversight or inconsistent safety standards.  These failures can result in cross-contamination between different products or the inclusion of unlisted allergens and hazardous materials into food.\n\nThat can have significant implications for households. Many other things besides eggs have made it into food mistakenly, including another common allergen: milk. Other scenarios include pieces of plastic making it into a pulled pork sandwich or salad dressing.\n\nShould companies be required to help recycle their own products?\n\nThey should get tax breaks instead\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nUltimately, ensuring better food safety is a group effort by manufacturers, regulators, and consumers. On the front end, manufacturers need to tighten up their production to minimize mistakes that can lead to missing instances of unlisted ingredients and contamination.\n\nRegulators can proactively check up on producers to make sure they are closely complying with food safety standards. Because humans are involved, there's always a chance something can slip through the cracks.\n\nThat's where it becomes incumbent on consumers to raise the alarm if something is off on a food item. Regulators can broadcast that message quickly and minimize the damage with comprehensive and expedient recall notices.\n\nThe next step falls to producers to find out where things went sideways and address any lingering issues that led to the mistake.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Now that the Kansas City Chiefs have committed to building a new stadium and team headquarters in Kansas, what’s next for the Truman Sports Complex?\n\nWhile the Royals could still renew their lease with Jackson County, county legislator Manny Abarca says it’s time to start thinking about the future of the land.\n\n“At the end of 2031, December 1, something will change and we want to be ready for that with a plan, with a strategy, if we’ve got to tear down one or two stadiums, we should be prepared for that, not waiting for after the fact,” Abarca said.\n\nAbarca wrote a letter to Jackson County Executive Phil LeVota on Wednesday, with a plan to use the existing Repair, Maintenance, Management, and Operations (RMMO) fund to set aside money for the potential demolition of one or both stadiums and the redevelopment of the land.\n\n“We’ve got to have a strategic plan going forward,” Abarca said.\n\n“That opportunity of us, scrapping some of that maintenance and repair money towards the strategic plan is still within our RMMO accounts. So, there’s some opportunity. We just have to be willing to do it.”\n\nCurrently, a 3/8 cent sales tax sends roughly $55 million annually to the complex’s upkeep and renovations. Saving half of that money over the course of the next 5 years could amount to north of $137 million.\n\nAs for what’s next for the land, Abarca says it could be of huge benefit for the county.\n\n“I think we can look at that as a county park, as a county asset. There were houses there before and so I think there’s an opportunity to look at that as a public housing option if there aren’t stadiums there. It’s adjacent to our Rock Island corridor, which is currently a bike route, but could be a mass transit route. There’s a lot of opportunity, right? Its geographic location is really center of our county.”\n\nWhether the Royals decide to stay at Truman or leave, Abarca says it’s time to be prepared for the next phase of that land.\n\n“Before taxpayers were asked to fund stadiums, this was a green space. These were neighborhoods. These were communities. There’s vibrancy that was there before. Now, instead of walking away with an abandoned stadium, that can be 30 to 50 to $70 million to tear down and maybe two of those, it can at least be a green space.”",

    "description": "Does today's Wordle have you stumped? Here are some hints and the answer.",
    "fullText": "Happy new year! We hope 2026 brings you everything you long for. One thing you might be looking for is to keep your Wordle streak going for as long as possible. To help with that, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Thursday's puzzle (#1,657).\n\nIt may be that you're a Wordle newcomer and you're not completely sure how to play the game. We're here to help with that as well.\n\nWordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that debuted in 2021. There is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.\n\nWordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that shows how they fare each day in a spoiler-free way. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.\n\nThe New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.\n\nTo start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard. However, you can still use those letters in subsequent guesses.\n\nYou'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.\n\nWordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets and Discord. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.\n\nIf you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,600 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.\n\nIn addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.\n\nBefore today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed:\n\nYesterday's Wordle answer for Wednesday, December 31 — SIREN\n\nEvery day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word.\n\nIn case you still haven't quite figured it out by that point, we'll then provide the first letter of the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle.\n\nThis should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly. Spoilers are ahead.\n\nHere is a hint for today's Wordle answer:\n\nA short story akin to a fairy tale that has a moral lesson to impart.\n\nThere are no repeated letters in today's Wordle answer.\n\nThe first letter of today's Wordle answer is F.\n\nThis is your final warning before we reveal today's Wordle answer. No take-backs.\n\nDon't blame us if you happen to scroll too far and accidentally spoil the game for yourself.\n\nWhat is today’s Wordle? Today's Wordle answer is...\n\nNot to worry if you didn't figure out today's Wordle word. If you made it this far down the page, hopefully you at least kept your streak going. And, hey: there's always another game tomorrow.",

The deaths may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran’s theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded elsewhere.

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Widening demonstrations sparked by Iran's ailing economy spread Thursday into the Islamic Republic's rural provinces, with at least seven people being killed in the first fatalities reported among security forces and protesters, authorities said.\n\nThe deaths may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran’s theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded elsewhere. The fatalities, two on Wednesday and five on Thursday, occurred in four cities, largely home to Iran’s Lur ethnic group.\n\nThe protests have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the demonstrations have yet to be countrywide and have not been as intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.\n\nThe most-intense violence appeared to strike Azna, a city in Iran's Lorestan province, some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of Tehran. There, online videos purported to show objects in the street ablaze and gunfire echoing as people shouted: “Shameless! Shameless!”\n\nThe semiofficial Fars news agency reported three people had been killed. Other media, including pro-reform outlets, cited Fars for the report while state-run media did not fully acknowledge the violence there or elsewhere. It wasn't clear why there wasn't more reporting over the unrest, but journalists had faced arrest over their reporting in 2022.\n\nIn Lordegan, a city in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, online videos showed demonstrators gathered on a street, with the sound of gunfire in the background. The footage matched known features of Lordegan, some 470 kilometers (290 miles) south of Tehran.\n\nFars, citing an anonymous official, said two people had been killed during the protests Thursday.\n\nThe Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said two people had been killed there, identifying the dead as demonstrators. It also shared a still image of what appeared to be an Iranian police officer, wearing body armor and wielding a shotgun.\n\nIn 2019, the area around Lordegan saw widespread protests and demonstrators reportedly damaged government buildings after a report said people there had been infected with HIV by contaminated needles used at a local health care clinic.\n\nIn Fuladshahr in Iran's Isfahan province, state media reported on the death of a man there Thursday that activist groups attributed to the police opening fire on demonstrators.\n\n'Protests due to economic pressures'\n\nA separate demonstration Wednesday night reportedly led to the 21-year-old volunteer in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Basij force.\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member’s death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, which is believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Lorestan province.\n\nThe Guard member “was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defense of public order,” he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.\n\n“The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns,\" Pourali said. \"The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.”\n\nThe protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, over 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Tehran. Local prosecutor Kazem Nazari said 20 people had been arrested after the protests and that calm had returned to the city, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.\n\nIran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters. However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.\n\nMeanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had linked to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.\n\nIran's theocracy had declared Wednesday a public holiday across much of the country, citing cold weather, likely as a bid to get people out of the capital for a long weekend. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.\n\nThe protests, taking root in economic issues, have heard demonstrators chant against Iran's theocracy as well. The country's leaders are still reeling after Israel launched a 12-day war against the country in June. The U.S. also bombed Iranian nuclear sites during the war.\n\nIran has said it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program to ease sanctions. However, those talks have yet to happen as U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have warned Tehran against reconstituting its atomic program.",

    "description": "In 1930, archaeologists found he lower half of a massive statue of Ramesses II. Now, they've discovered the long-missing top half in pristine condition.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nIn 1930, German archaeologists uncovered the lower half of a massive statue, estimating that it likely originally stood some 23 feet tall.\n\nNow, U.S. and Egyptian archaeologists have announced the discovery of the long-missing top half in thankfully pristine condition.\n\nA proposal has already been submitted to unite the bottom with the long-missing top half, and the discoverers are confident of its approval.\n\nSome 96 years ago, German archaeologist Günther Roeder unearthed the lower half of what would’ve been a massive, 23-foot-tall statue of Ramesses II—one of the most celebrated pharaohs throughout all 31 dynasties of Ancient Egyptian history. Roeder found the statue 150 miles south of Cairo in the Minya Governorate, near the modern-day city of El Ashmunein. In ancient times, this area along the Nile was known as Khemnu. It served as a provincial capital in the Old Kingdom of Egypt (2649–2130 BCE), and was later called Hermopolis Magna when Romans ruled the Mediterranean.\n\nMany treasures of the region’s illustrious past were known to be buried in the surrounding desert, and while Roeder’s discovery proved remarkable, the rest of the enormous statue he found remained lost to time … until now.\n\nIn March 2024, the Egyptian archaeologists—in partnership with U.S. experts—announced that after 96 years, they’d finally found the missing upper half of Roeder’s statute. Speaking with Reuters, the experts from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities reported that the upper half stretched some 12.5 feet tall, and depicted Ramesses II wearing a headdress topped with a royal cobra.\n\nHowever, the discovery of this ancient statue—and exquisite preservation—was far from certain when the statue was first discovered lying face down in January 2024.\n\n“One problem with Hermopolis is that it’s close to the Nile. After [the building of] the Aswan Low Dam, the water table became a huge issue. There was no guarantee that the stone would be OK,” Yvona Trnka-Amrhein, assistant professor of classics at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-leader of the team said in a press statement. “Sometimes sandstone is uncovered that is basically just sand or degraded limestone. It could have just been a lump of rock.”\n\nLuckily, after further excavation, the team confirmed that the statue was remarkably well-preserved and contained another amazing find—traces of blue-and-yellow pigment could be found on the statue’s surface. Hopefully, further analysis of this pigment will help researchers understand the context of the statue’s creation, as well as its original appearance.\n\n“We knew it might be there, but we were not specifically looking for it,” Trnka-Amrhein said in a press statement. “It was plausible that the rest of the statue might be there, but it was a total surprise.”\n\nThankfully, the hunch proved correct, and Egyptian co-leader Basem Gehad has already submitted a proposal to reunite the two pieces together at long last (Roeder’s lower half still remains on site in El Ashmunein). Trnka-Amrhein expects it to be approved.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump may now be having trouble walking across flat surfaces.\n\nThe president appeared to be hiding a slight limp as he was filmed walking with his wife, Melania, at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe new speculation over the 79-year-old’s health came after he revealed in an interview that he tried compression socks for his swollen ankles and used makeup to cover the bruising on his hands caused by large daily doses of aspirin.\n\nThe popular anti-Trump X account Call to Activism posted a clip of Trump appearing to drag his right leg as he walked down a runway toward the press gathered to snap attendees of his ritzy New Year’s Eve party.\n\nThe account, which has over 1.1 million followers, wrote, ″Trump just showed up at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate New Year’s, dragging his right leg, and quickly adjusted his walk when he realizes the cameras are on. What’s Trump hiding?\"\n\nIn the clip, Trump can be seen slightly limping as he enters the frame, but after a few steps, he adopts a steadier gait before he and First Lady Melania Trump stop to pose for photographs.\n\nViewers were split on whether the clip showed a new medical malady for the oldest president in American history or if it was no big deal.\n\n“It pretty obvious [sic] he is dragging his right leg. If Biden had done that every news station would have this video up all day all time about his health,” wrote one suspicious viewer on X.\n\n“Honestly? Probably nothing,” said a less-convinced X user. “He knows the cameras are always watching, so of course he adjusted. Not every awkward step means there’s something being hidden.”\n\nOn Monday, the nearly octogenarian president had difficulty descending four small steps at Mar-a-Lago. On multiple occasions, he has descended the steps on Air Force One at a snail’s pace.\n\nHe has also been filmed struggling to walk in straight lines and dragging his right leg in public for years.\n\nWednesday’s Mar-a-Lago entrance comes amidst intensified speculation about Trump’s health issues, which the Daily Beast has led the charge in covering.\n\nThese include persistent bruising on his hands, difficulty sleeping through the night and staying awake during the day, and chronic venous insufficiency, which has caused his ankles to swell.\n\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump personally called the publication to complain about the persistent coverage of his health and attempted to set the record straight on some health mysteries that have dogged his second term.\n\nTrump told the publication that he takes quadruple the common dose of aspirin for “cardiac prevention,” and that is what causes the bruising on his hands.\n\nThe piece did not address speculation about Trump’s ambling gait. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the president’s Mar-a-Lago entrance.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast reported on Trump taking a circuitous route between Marine One and Air Force One in September, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the publication, “You must be f-----g blind or stupid, because that was a perfect walk.”",

    "fullText": "CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — Swiss investigators are probing what caused a fire in a bar at an Alpine ski resort that left around 40 people dead and another 115 injured during a New Year's celebration.\n\nMost injuries, many of them serious, occurred when the blaze swept through the crowded bar less than two hours after midnight Thursday in southwestern Switzerland.\n\nThe Crans-Montana resort is best known as an international ski and golf venue. Overnight, its crowded Le Constellation bar morphed from a scene of revelry into the site of potentially one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.\n\nCrans-Montana is less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Sierre, Switzerland, where 28 people, including many children, were killed when a bus from Belgium crashed inside a Swiss tunnel in 2012.\n\nHere’s what we know about the deadly fire:\n\nThe blaze broke out around 1:30 a.m. Thursday inside the Le Constellation bar amid the holiday celebration.\n\nTwo women told French broadcaster BFMTV they were inside when they saw a male bartender lifting a female bartender on his shoulders as she held a lit candle in a bottle. The flames spread, collapsing the wooden ceiling, they told the broadcaster.\n\nPeople frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door, causing a crowd surge, one of the women said.\n\nA young man at the scene said people smashed windows to escape the fire, some gravely injured, reported BFMTV. He said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames, likening what happened to a horror movie.\n\nThe injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theater at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, said Mathias Reynard, head of the regional government of the Valais Canton.\n\nOfficials rule out possible attack\n\nWhile officials said Thursday it was too early to determine the fire's cause, investigators have already ruled out that it could have been an attack.\n\nExperts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage, said Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, at a news conference.\n\nWork is underway to identify the victims and inform their families, according to Valais Canton police commander Frédéric Gisler.\n\nThe blaze triggered a flashover or backdraft\n\nThe Swiss officials called the blaze an “embrasement généralisé,” a French firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.\n\nVictims suffered from serious burns and smoke inhalation. Some were flown to specialist hospitals across the country.\n\nAuthorities urged people to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require the already overwhelmed medical resources.\n\nA top venue for the world's best athletes\n\nWith high-altitude ski runs rising around 3,000 meters (nearly 9,850 feet) in the heart of the Valais region’s snowy peaks and pine forests, Crans-Montana is one of the top venues on the World Cup circuit.\n\nThe resort will host the best men’s and women’s downhill racers, including Lindsey Vonn, for their final events before the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.\n\nThe town’s Crans-sur-Sierre golf club, down the street from the bar, stages the European Masters each August on a picturesque course.\n\nDazio reported from Berlin and Leicester reported from Paris. Geir Moulson in Berlin and Graham Dunbar in Geneva contributed to this report.",

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nFor industry watchers, DeepSeek's papers often provide an important early signal of the engineering choices that will shape the start-up's next major model release.\n\nIn the paper, released on Thursday, a team of 19 DeepSeek researchers said they tested mHC on models with 3 billion, 9 billion and 27 billion parameters, and found it scaled without adding significant computational burden.\n\n\"Empirical results confirm that mHC effectively ... [enables] stable large-scale training with superior scalability compared with conventional HC (hyper-connections),\" wrote the researchers, led by Zhenda Xie, Yixuan Wei and Huanqi Cao.\n\nLiang was listed as the final author.\n\nThe team added that \"crucially, through efficient infrastructure-level optimisations,\" mHC delivers these gains with \"negligible computational overhead\".\n\nThe publication also offered fresh evidence that Liang, who has kept a low profile despite DeepSeek's increasing fame, remains closely involved in core research at one of China's most closely watched AI companies.\n\nHyper-connections were first proposed by ByteDance researchers in September 2024 as a tweak to ResNet (residual networks) - a dominant deep learning architecture introduced in 2015 by Microsoft Research Asia scientists including legendary Chinese computer scientist He Kaiming.\n\nResNet enables the training of very deep neural networks by stabilising the training so that key information, or residual, is retained as the number of layers increases.\n\nThe paper was uploaded to the open-access repository arXiv by DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng himself, who has also posted DeepSeek's more prominent technical papers in recent years.

Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nIt has become integral to major large language models such as OpenAI's GPT as well as Google DeepMind's Nobel-winning AlphaFold system.\n\nHowever, ResNet has notable limitations, including difficulty ensuring that the learning signal that flows through the neural network remains strong without \"collapsing\" into a one-size-fits-all state.\n\nAccording to the DeepSeek researchers, ByteDance's HC solution successfully addressed these issues by expanding the residual stream and enhancing the complexity of the neural network, \"without altering the computational overhead of individual units.\"\n\nDeepSeek argued, however, that the earlier approach did not fully account for rising memory costs, leaving its \"practical scalability\" constrained for large-model training.\n\nInstead, they proposed an additional tweak that \"constrains\" the HC network with a specific manifold to ensure compute and cost efficiency.\n\n\"mHC will help address current limitations and potentially illuminate new pathways for the evolution of next-generation foundational architectures,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe paper was uploaded to the open-access repository arXiv by DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng himself, who has also posted DeepSeek's more prominent technical papers in recent years, including work linked to its R1 and V3 models.\n\nOther less important papers have typically been uploaded by other researchers.\n\nFlorian Brand, a PhD student at Germany's Trier University and an expert on China's AI ecosystem, said DeepSeek's papers often acted as an early signal of the technical direction behind its next generation of models.\n\nIndustry expectations are running high that DeepSeek could release its next major model in the run-up to the Spring Festival holiday in mid-February.\n\nPreviously, the company released its groundbreaking R1 model on the eve of last year's national holiday, fuelling speculation it could repeat that playbook this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

    "description": "Bitcoin price enters 2026 in a stalemate. A 1% move at key levels could reveal the winner between buyers and sellers.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin price enters 2026 stuck in the same buyer-seller fight that kept it muted through late 2025. The price is almost flat over the past 30 days, down about 0.6%, which shows how neither side has taken control.\n\nIt is still down about 7% year on year. This balance of pressure has turned into a stalemate. However, a 1% or even a 3.5% move from here could decide the next direction if the right conditions appear.\n\nBitcoin is trading inside a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. This shape shows the market trapped between lower highs and higher lows, hinting at the buyer-seller tussle. Capital flows are not helping the upside.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has trended lower since December 10. For the unversed, the CMF measures how much money flows into or out of an asset. It shows a bearish divergence now because the BTC price has trended higher between December 18 and December 31, while the CMF made lower lows. That signals continued outflows and selling pressure.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nThis negative capital flow is being partially offset by exchange outflows.\n\nExchange net position change shows coins leaving exchanges. That often hints at accumulation. On December 19, exchange outflows were about 16,563 BTC. By January 1, they rose to 38,508 BTC.\n\nThat is an increase of about 132%. This push of coins leaving exchanges helps price stability and keeps the lower trendline of the triangle protected.\n\nSmart Money Index readings confirm the lack of direction. The Smart Money Index compares how larger, informed traders position versus the broader market. The line is hugging its signal line with no clear separation. That hints that larger traders are waiting for a breakout and not betting on either direction yet.\n\nUntil the breakout happens, the triangle stays neutral.\n\nThis matches what CMF and exchange flow data are saying. Outflows signal pressure. Exchange withdrawals signal support. Together, they cancel each other and hold the BTC price still. And even the most informed traders are unsure as to which side would win.\n\nThe cost basis heat map highlights clusters where many buyers last bought. These clusters often act like support or resistance. The nearest resistance zone is around $88,082 to $88,459, where about 200,035 BTC sit.\n\nBitcoin is trading near $87,480. A daily close roughly 1% higher would put the price above that zone. That could act as the first bullish trigger and settle the upper triangle break. On the BTC price chart, the level aligning with this cluster is $88,300, which needs to break first.",

    "title": "MAGA Will Probably Be Really, Really, Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Uncomfy With This Report On How Trump's Economy Is Doing",
    "description": "I'm keeping track of Trump's economy right here. Every month. Enjoy!",
    "fullText": "(AKA the unemployment rate, cost of eggs, gas prices, inflation, the Dow Jones, whether citizens received a stimulus check, and Trump's overall approval rating.)\n\nIt wasn't exactly convincing, considering Americans are facing massive insurance hikes in 2026 because Trump and his party recently chose to allow Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire in two weeks. Likewise, our pockets are shrinking as the cost of food and living bloat.\n\nNote: Data on inflation is released a few weeks after each month has ended, so our reports will look at the previous month's numbers.\n\nGetting data on the unemployment rate between September and November has been plagued and vague due to the government shutdown this year. September's numbers were late. October's rate was altogether canceled, and November appears to have come in at 4.6% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFor someone who brags about a booming economy, the steady increase in Americans searching for work sure doesn't bode well for the president's claims.\n\nAh, the price of eggs. Another cursed number.\n\nFood indexes are also released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and so we won't be getting an October number. I can, however, report that eggs officially dropped under the $3 mark, and you can find a grade A dozen for around $2.86 on average in November.\n\nShifting from a positive to a negative, the cost of beef is still skyrocketing, and I continue to find that giving up red meat this year was one of the best financial decisions I've made.\n\nIf you're looking for a pound of beef, prices jumped to $6.50 on average in November.\n\n(And yes, the government shutdown is still acting as the Ghost of Christmas past, and we will not be getting an October average here either.)\n\nGas is going down, though! I'm sure y'all will flood the comment section with local prices wayyyyy higher than the national average, and wish you saw numbers as low as this, but according to the Energy Information Administration, a gallon of gasoline cost around $3.179 last month.\n\nInflation dropped to its lowest point in months, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2.7% figure has raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \"For the inflation report, many economists were caught off guard by the way the B.L.S. handled the distortions, which is part of why they are casting so much doubt on the numbers published today.\"\n\nThe above is fancy speak to say that the government shutdown caused \"distortions\" in the data surrounding inflation, and so it may or may not paint a prettier picture than reality.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones neither rose nor fell in November, according to Stat Muse. So, there's that.\n\nWe're approaching a full year under Trump's second presidency, and there's still no stimulus check in sight for struggling Americans. What happened to those $2,000 tariff dividend checks Trump promised on Truth Social? I haven't heard a single word of it since Nov. 9.\n\nYIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES.

YIKES.\n\nTrump's approval rating hit an all-time low for this term. Gallup reports that only 36% of Americans approve of how Trump's second presidency is going. It's looking BLEAK.\n\nIt's not uncommon for me to see comments from conservatives who claim the data presented in this report is \"fake news.\" Usually, I point to the fact that the data is retrieved from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Energy Administration, which fall under Trump's own administration. So, if the numbers are \"fake news,\" that would mean these MAGA commenters believe Trump's people are spreading fake news...\n\nI appreciate the readership, regardless. <3\n\nAlso in In the News: 27 Photos Of Donald Trump In 2025 He Probably Reaaaaaally Doesn't Want You To See\n\nAlso in In the News: \"Oh My God\": People Are Not Holding Back AT ALL After Trump Made Another White House \"Upgrade,\" And Hoo Boy, You Gotta See This One\n\nAlso in In the News: Donald Trump Hated His Time Magazine Cover...

    "description": "The Trump administration is facing a new legal complaint from a group of government employees who are affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.  The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.  “This policy is not about cost or care — it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is facing a new legal complaint from a group of government employees who are affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.\n\nThe complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.\n\nThe complaint argues that denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination and asks the personnel office to rescind the policy.\n\n“This policy is not about cost or care — it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.\n\nThe complaint, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, includes testimonies from four current federal workers at the State Department, Health and Human Services and the Postal Service who would be directly affected by the elimination of coverage.\n\nFor instance, the Postal Service employee has a daughter whose doctors recommended that she get puberty blockers and potentially hormone replacement therapy for her diagnosed gender dysphoria, which would not be covered under the new OPM policy, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint notes that the workers are making the claim on behalf of themselves and a “class of similarly situated federal employees.”\n\nThe Trump administration has taken other steps to restrict care for transgender Americans, particularly minors. In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.\n\nSenior Trump officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors. But such restrictions go against recommendations from major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin’s Jan. 1 price history highlights recurring patterns of rapid growth followed by sharp corrections.\n\nDespite major drawdowns, Bitcoin has repeatedly rebounded to new highs.\n\nAnalysts say seasonal trading patterns offer limited support for a near-term rebound in 2025.\n\nBitcoin’s (BTC) price on New Year’s Day has repeatedly marked turning points in the crypto market’s volatile history, offering a snapshot of investor sentiment as markets enter each new year.\n\nA year-by-year review of Bitcoin’s Jan. 1 price highlights how periods of rapid growth and renewed optimism have built it from a fringe experiment into the mega asset it is today.\n\nBitcoin began 2015 trading near $314, reflecting a prolonged downturn following the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange and waning interest after its first major speculative cycle.\n\nPrices recovered steadily over the next two years.\n\nThat momentum culminated at the beginning of 2018, when Bitcoin opened the year near $13,657 after a historic rally in late 2017.\n\nThe surge marked the asset’s first mainstream breakthrough but also preceded a sharp reversal.\n\nBitcoin’s price fell to about $3,843 by Jan. 1, 2019, as the market unwound what many critics had labelled a speculative bubble.\n\nHowever, the decline did not mark the end of the asset’s growth.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2021, it traded near $29,374, supported by growing institutional adoption and looser global monetary conditions.\n\nThe rally continued into early 2022, with Bitcoin opening the year near $47,686, before tightening monetary policy and a series of crypto-sector failures triggered another steep downturn.\n\nBitcoin entered 2023 trading at roughly $16,625, reflecting widespread risk aversion after high-profile exchange collapses and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nPrices rebounded strongly over the following year, rising to about $44,167 at the start of 2024.\n\nBTC began 2025 at approximately $94,419, near record highs.\n\nIn 2025, technical analysts suggest that Bitcoin’s recent weakness may persist beyond the holiday period.\n\nValdrin Tahiri, an analyst at CCN, said seasonal trading patterns offer little support for a near-term reversal.",

    "title": "I visited Amsterdam for the first time with my family — here are 4 things that surprised me most about our trip",
    "description": "Our first trip to Amsterdam as a family was great, but there are mistakes I wish we avoided and tips I wish we knew before we got to the Netherlands.",
    "fullText": "I'd long imagined Amsterdam as a picturesque city of canals, tulips, and windmills.\n\nHowever, visiting for the first time with my husband and 11-year-old twins quickly showed me a few surprising realities that coexist alongside those postcard-worthy views.\n\nFrom its frenetic bike culture to its unexpected culinary influences, the city challenged some of my assumptions even as it reinforced others.\n\nHere's what surprised me most about my first time in Amsterdam.\n\nI was already aware of Amsterdam's reputation as a cycling city — thanks to its flat, compact geography.\n\nBut until you're standing at a crosswalk with hundreds of bikes whizzing by in every direction, it's hard to really internalize just how central cycling is to daily life.\n\nThere are more bikes than residents here, and riders of all ages commute with precision and speed.\n\nI spotted the littlest kids perching on handlebars (or even riding their own bikes in the street), people texting while biking, and lots of cyclists running red lights … all while tourists like us scrambled to get out of the way.\n\nLocals aren't aggressive so much as efficient per se; bikes are treated like vehicles, with their own rules and right-of-way. We learned quickly to look both ways — twice — before stepping into a lane.\n\nIt didn't take me long to realize that my idea of renting bikes for a leisurely family ride through town was not going to be the casual thing I'd thought we might be up for.\n\nTo get around, we mostly relied on Amsterdam's trams and buses. They ran on time, were comfortable, and took us pretty much everywhere we wanted to go.\n\nBut we had a major issue on our way out of town: Since our family of four had lots of luggage for a two-week jaunt through multiple European cities, we called an Uber to get us to the train station when it was time to leave.\n\nThis turned out to be a disaster. We left with what we thought should have been plenty of time, but we got stuck in gridlock traffic for far longer than anticipated.\n\nFinally, we ended up jumping out of the unmoving car mid-ride and into a bus (with all our luggage), which we hoped would get us to the train station faster, since they have dedicated lanes.\n\nBut by then, it was too late; we ultimately missed our train. At least now I understand why so many locals skip cars entirely.\n\nAt our hotel, I asked the concierge for local recommendations for a celebratory dinner on the evening of my twins' birthday.\n\nShe explained that many traditional Dutch foods are prepared in people's homes, so there isn't as huge of a dining-out culture for this cuisine as I'd expected. So she recommended we get a traditional meal of \"rijsttafel,\" or \"rice table,\" at an Indonesian restaurant.\n\nRijsttafel is a Dutch-Indonesian feast born of the country's colonial ties to Indonesia — the Netherlands colonized Indonesia for roughly 350 years.\n\nIt's presented family-style, with tons of small dishes in the middle of the table for sampling, and served with rice — think satay, rendang, sambal (chili pastes), and vegetables.\n\nThe variety lets us sample a wide range of flavors, textures, and spices. It was incredible.\n\nAmsterdam has a strong reputation for its permissive sex and drug culture, which we didn't seek out on a family trip. However, this vibe did seep into things like naughty souvenirs and street art, which slightly raised a couple of tween eyebrows.\n\nThat said, we generally found Amsterdam to be incredibly family-friendly. The walkable, compact city is filled with cultural attractions and parks, so even with kids in tow, it didn't feel overwhelming.\n\nMy twins were able to navigate on foot, hop easily on trams, explore the sprawling Vondelpark greenspace, and sample kid-friendly treats, such as warm stroopwafels, from street vendors.\n\nAside from obvious venues for adults, we didn't come across many spots where visitors had to be a certain age to step inside, which helped our whole family feel included. Kids seemed to be welcome all over, even in restaurants and pubs where we might not expect to see them back home in the US.",

    "description": "We asked interior designers about 2026 living-room trends. Color capping, antique decor, and mirror TVs are in, and harsh overhead lighting is out.",
    "fullText": "Living rooms are often considered the heart of the home, serving as a versatile space for hosting guests, spending quality time with loved ones, and relaxing after a long day.\n\nSo, if there's any room in your house that should feel warm, inviting, and full of personal touches, it should be this one.\n\nWith that in mind, Business Insider asked five interior designers to share insight on what will be popular in living rooms this coming year, and which fads are on their way out.\n\nHere's what they predict will be in and out for living rooms in 2026.\n\nAccording to Candace Griffin, principal designer and founder of Candace Mary Interiors, color capping will be a popular living-room trend this year.\n\nUnlike color drenching, which covers an entire room's walls in a single hue, color capping uses multiple shades from the same tone to create movement, depth, and a more polished look.\n\n\"Color capping can sometimes be used to draw your eye up, to make your ceilings feel taller,\" Griffin said. \"… It serves a functional purpose, but also just gives you another opportunity to have some fun in the space.\"\n\nUltra-glam light fixtures will also lose popularity to soft, antique-style lamps in 2026, said Kara Thomas, interior designer and founder of Studio KT.\n\nThat said, the trend toward unique antiques will extend beyond lamps and sconces.\n\n\"I think the desire to fill a home with antiques and thoughtfully sourced items stems from a desire to be more unique, especially with the internet flooded with a lot of rinse-and-repeat ideas,\" Thomas said.\n\nFor that reason, she believes we will see more rustic decor, mixed metals, and vintage artwork and frames in living rooms this year.\n\nInterior designer Molly Torres Portnof of DATE Interiors said she predicts a shift toward more distinctive, intimate, and creative layouts.\n\nThis could look like incorporating a cozy reading nook or a small playroom for the kids into your living room.\n\n\"If you have the space to create separate conversation areas, you can get creative with those corners and niches,\" Griffin added. \"[It's] really just maximizing every inch of the space and not feeling like you have to be in a box, per se.\"\n\nHandmade, wooden furniture and handwoven textiles will be everywhere in 2026, according to Molly Miller, principal designer and founder of Molly Miller Interiors.\n\n\"These elements add depth and authenticity that mass-produced items simply can't match,\" she said.\n\nThese particular elements are also becoming increasingly important as people gravitate toward home spaces that feel inviting, timeless, and emotionally calming, Miller added.\n\nOftentimes, people want to put a mirror on the wall or above their fireplace, but feel like they don't have the room to fit it next to a TV.\n\nWith that in mind, Torres Portnof said she's excited about the possibility of mirror TVs taking over living-room spaces.\n\nAs the name suggests, a mirror TV looks like a sleek, framed mirror when turned off and appears like a high-definition television when turned on.\n\n\"I love the fact that it's dual-purpose, and I think others will as well,\" she said.\n\nAs more people turn toward designs that evoke warmth and comfort, designers expect soothing, earthy palettes to become everyone's go-to choice for living-room colors.\n\n\"Everything is leaning more toward earthy tones,\" said Thomas. In particular, she sees burgundy, deep browns, olive greens, and darker blues taking over living rooms this year and beyond.\n\nDanielle Chiprut, interior designer and founder of Danielle Rose Design Co., believes that bland, cold-feeling spaces are becoming outdated.\n\nInstead, she predicts a growing shift toward heavily textured living-room designs with warmer colors, patterned sofas, and personalized elements.\n\n\"We're moving away from that minimalist, modern design and into a more layered, cozy [layout],\" Chiprut said.\n\nFurthermore, as living rooms become less sterile and showroom-like, Griffin is also seeing a general pull toward spaces that feel truly \"lived in.\"\n\n\"The real way to achieve that is by taking your time and incorporating the things that you like and that are important to you,\" she added.\n\nFor example, when it comes to artwork, she recommends building a collection over time and avoiding mass-produced pieces.",

    "description": "Afters years of talk, governments in Australia, France, and more are taking action to ban social-media for kids. Some warn of unintended effects.",
    "fullText": "After years of discussion, 2026 is shaping up to be the year when governments around the world take action on kids using social media.\n\nAustralia, France, Denmark, and Norway are advancing or planning social-media bans for young people under a certain age. In the US, a patchwork of state-based efforts is likely to face tougher prospects.\n\nThe changes come as concerns mount over the toll that platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat can take on young people's mental health.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, in a New Year's Eve speech, reiterated his support for banning social media for children and young teens — setting the tone for what could be a landmark year for such efforts worldwide.\n\n\"We will protect our children and teenagers from social media and screens,\" he said.\n\nWorld leaders have talked for years about restricting children's access to social media. Now, that talk is crystallizing into action. Australia became the first major nation to impose a social-media ban for children under 16. Its law took effect in December.\n\nMacron wants France to follow Australia's example. Bills in the works would restrict access for children under 15 starting next fall, timed to coincide with the start of the new academic year.\n\nThe Malaysian government has said it intends to implement a similar ban this year. Denmark is also planning a ban for children under 15, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced in October, warning that \"never before have so many children and young people suffered from anxiety and depression.\" Norway, too, is considering similar measures, though its prime minister acknowledged it would be a challenge to enforce.\n\nIn India, high court judges suggested in December that the country consider legislation modeled on Australia's approach.\n\nSocial media executives have criticized bans on their products, touting their own safeguards, questioning the feasibility of such measures, and warning of unintended consequences.\n\nAs for the Australian law, Google and Meta had both called for a delay in its implementation. They said the government should rely on an age-verification system, which had been under trial before the new law took effect.\n\n\"We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them,\" a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider last year in response to EU discussion on young people and social media.\n\nElon Musk, owner of X, criticized Australia's legislation, calling it \"a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\" TikTok expressed \"significant concerns\" with the legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, a nationwide effort in the US — the birthplace of the world's largest social media companies — faces an uphill battle.\n\nWhile lawmakers in Congress have floated proposals to restrict young people's access, none have passed. Instead, the push has largely shifted to the states, where a patchwork of age-verification rules, parental-consent laws, and time limits is advancing, often amid legal challenges.\n\nVirginia is set to impose a one-hour daily limit on social-media use for children under 16 unless parents opt out, a law that is scheduled to take effect this year but is already facing legal challenges. Nebraska recently passed legislation requiring parental consent for minors to open social-media accounts. Other states, including Utah and Florida, have advanced age-verification or parental-consent laws that have been delayed or blocked in court.\n\nSome states are targeting smartphones, rather than just social media, imposing \"bell-to-bell\" bans on cellphones at public schools.\n\nAttorneys general from 14 states sued TikTok in October, saying the app is addictive and profits from damaging the mental health of children. TikTok has disputed that its products harm kids, defending its own internal safeguards.\n\nWhile momentum is gathering for efforts to protect children from social media, some industry watchers have cautioned that such efforts aren't a magic fix and could have unexpected knock-on effects.\n\n\"While UNICEF welcomes the growing commitment to children's online safety, social media bans come with their own risks, and they may even backfire,\" UNICEF, the United Nations agency focused on children, said in a December statement, noting that some marginalized children rely on social media and that others may find workarounds or flock to darker corners of the internet.",

    "title": "What it's like visiting the island of St. Barts — a beloved party spot for billionaires and their superyachts",
    "description": "St. Barthelemy, or St. Barts, is a French-speaking Caribbean island with beaches and high-end shops where billionaires like Jeff Bezos vacation.",
    "fullText": "Located in the French West Indies, the small island runs about 11 miles long and 2.5 miles wide.\n\nIt's typically warm and sunny most of the year, with temperatures often in the 70s, 80s, or low 90s, and peak tourist season starts in late fall and lasts through the spring.\n\nAs a French territory, the official language of St. Barts is French, though English is also widely spoken.\n\nThe exclusive-feeling island is home to more than a dozen beaches, where visitors can soak up the sun on smooth, sandy shores and in crystal-clear water.\n\n\"I always say if you want to have your toes in the sand and eat a croissant that feels like you're in Paris, St. Barts is the place for you,\" Elisabeth Brown, the membership director at the luxury concierge service Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider's Madeline Berg.\n\nSurrounded by shallow coral reefs, St. Barts has some top-tier snorkeling spots, such as Grand Cul-de-Sac — home to sea turtles and a range of tropical fish.\n\nLocal natural sights also include mountains and hills formed from volcanic eruptions. That said, there are no active volcanoes on St. Barts.\n\nJeff Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez Bezos, were photographed in St. Barts this week — and the Amazon founder has been spotted in St. Barts on multiple occasions over the years.\n\nNo matter the time of year, though, the island regularly welcomes the wealthy.\n\nCelebrities like Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, and Leonardo DiCaprio have visited in the past, and influential banking families, like the Rothschilds, have famously purchased property there.\n\nIn addition to Bezos' vessel, massive yachts owned by Playrix founder Dmitry Bukhman, Dallas Mavericks owner Miriam Adelson, and entertainment mogul David Geffen also parked in St. Barts during the recent holiday.\n\nWhile the yachts are primarily used for transportation to the island, they're also attractions in and of themselves, featuring amenities such as jacuzzis and movie theaters.\n\nTravelers without private yachts can still reach the island by flying into an airport on a larger Caribbean island, like San Juan. From there, they could take a ferry or private boat to St Barts.\n\nVisitors have several options for accommodations, ranging from villa rentals starting at over $900 a night to luxurious hotels for an even higher price.\n\nThe Eden Rock hotel is just one example. It overlooks St. Jean Bay — home to one of the most popular beaches on St. Barts — and is home to fine-dining restaurants and holistic spas.\n\nDuring holiday seasons like New Year's, a single-night stay at its largest villa can cost upward of €13,000, or about $15,200.\n\nThere's also the Rosewood Le Guanahani resort, located on a private peninsula that's home to two secluded beaches, giving travelers the ultimate getaway far from crowds.\n\nSuch privacy comes at a price, as even its most basic room can run guests thousands of dollars a night.\n\nWith billionaire travelers always on-site, the island's retail scene largely caters to shoppers who can drop thousands at any given moment.\n\nSome of the designer brands that have boutiques on St. Barts include Hermès, Cartier, Dior, and Louis Vuitton.\n\nThe island's also home to luxury retailers like Patek Phillipe, which sells one-of-a-kind timepieces you can't find anywhere else. Some retail for five, six, and even seven figures.\n\nA trip to St. Barts isn't all about relaxation, though. There are plenty of places to party and experience live music.\n\nOne of the most popular spots for this on the island is Nikki Beach, an upscale restaurant and beach club. In past years, big-name musicians like Kygo and Mariah Carey have even performed at its New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nIt's also a go-to for people looking to relax poolside with a drink in hand — though keep in mind that even just renting a lounge chair may cost you over $100.",

    "title": "AI boom threatens to push smartphone, PC prices higher in 2026",
    "description": "AI data centers are soaking up key components, raising the risk of higher smartphone and PC prices for consumers in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Your smartphone's price might increase in 2026 — and you'll have AI to thank for that.\n\nAccording to a December 2025 report from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC), the manufacturing of Random Access Memory (RAM), used to store data in devices such as computers and phones, is being reallocated to support AI data centers, rather than being incorporated into phones and PCs.\n\nJust as your smartphone runs faster with more memory available, so do AI data centers. As more companies rely on AI tools, the importance of reliable processing power increases, leading to the increased usage of more RAM.\n\nIDC expects DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) supply growth to be below historical norms in 2026 at 16% year-on-year.\n\nAs the hunt for affordable RAM becomes increasingly challenging for smartphone manufacturers like Apple, Google, and Samsung, their costs are likely to rise, which could impact the prices they charge consumers.\n\n\"In the case of the upcoming memory crisis, this is something that will hit the market hard,\" IDC senior research director Nabila Popal told CNET in December. \"Those vendors will have almost no choice but to pass the increased cost to consumers.\"\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint also expects a slower year for all phone manufacturers. The firm projects global smartphone shipments to decrease 2.1% in 2026.\n\nThe firm's research suggests that the price for memory could increase 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as a device's memory can represent anywhere from 10% to 20% of the total bill of materials.\n\nLarger manufacturers with a broader range of products offered, in terms of price, should fare better than others, according to Counterpoint senior analyst Yang Wang, while lower-end markets will likely be hit the hardest.\n\n\"Apple and Samsung are best positioned to weather the next few quarters,\" Wang said. \"But it will be tough for others that don't have as much wiggle room to manage market share versus profit margins.\n\nEven still, Counterpoint predicts that average selling prices will increase by 6.9%. For people looking to buy the iPhone 17 Max base model, that could mean eventually paying closer to $1,281, up from the $1,199 price tag announced in 2025.",

And it remains to be seen if they'll want to play ball.\n\nBut Mamdani, who was read an oath of office by Sen. Bernie Sanders, made it clear his administration intends to \"govern expansively and audaciously.\"\n\nHere are some key quotes from Mamdani's speech on his plan to reshape the city, which he said he would make affordable for all:\n\nThose hoping Mamdani might moderate his views upon taking office may have received a wake-up call in his New Year's Day speech.\n\nThe new mayor didn't shirk from his socialist identity upon taking office, vowing to draw the city together by replacing \"the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism.\"\n\nChants of \"tax the rich\" rang out as Sanders spoke.\n\nMamandi said he planned to ensure the wealthiest would have to share the power under his administration.\n\nMamdani's speech criticized corporations and the government alike, sometimes in the same breath.\n\nHe pledged to deliver \"abundance,\" a lightning-rod word on the political left associated with the movement and book by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, which critiques liberal policies that fail to yield results and promote growth.\n\nMamdani vowed to \"reform a long broken property tax system,\" to crack down on \"the bad landlords who mistreat their tenants,\" and to \"free small business owners from the shackles of bloated bureaucracy.\"\n\nHe also reiterated the hallmarks of his campaign promises that enamored so many of his voters, reiterating his vows to deliver universal childcare, freeze the rent, and make \"buses fast and free.\"\n\n\"For too long in our city, freedom has belonged only to those who can afford to buy it,\" Mamdani said. \"Our City Hall will change that.\"",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nRobin Roefs (Sunderland): I think he has arguably been the signing of the season. Unbelievable the way he keeps performing to that same level and standard. He kept Sunderland in it against Manchester City with three or four great saves. The way that he has been playing and that backline has been playing, I could have just put that whole backline in. They were excellent and I thought he epitomised that.\n\nTrai Hume (Sunderland): We talk about Granit Xhaka, we talk about Roefs and we have spoken about individuals like Dan Ballard and the like but I think Hume has been their best performer throughout the whole course of it. Nobody is really talking about it.\n\nJaka Bijol (Leeds): At Anfield, everyone would have expected Liverpool to really, really do a job on this team here and make sure that they were ready to go. Unfortunately, Leeds are flying high. They defended resolutely and rode their luck, there was a massive chance for Hugo Ekitike to score and he probably should have but Leeds are in a good vein of form and Bijol has been an unsung hero.\n\nNathan Collins (Brentford): The game against Spurs was poor and the abilities and the attacking threat was poor. It was a defensive unit for both but I thought Nathan Collins was arguably the best defender on the pitch. Brentford continue their opportunity to stay in the league and that is going to be based on how defensively solid they are.\n\nMartin Zubimendi (Arsenal): Arsenal signed Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke and all of these other players that people were looking at. Probably their best bit of business was getting Zubimendi in early doors. He dictates the play, he's chipping in with a few goals as well now but he's really important to the way that they conduct themselves.\n\nJames Garner (Everton): He has played right-back, left-back, centre midfield, right midfield, you name it. He will play anywhere that Everton ask him to play. He does a job, not only is he a solid pro and a good kid but he never complains. When he's on the bench he doesn't complain, when he's playing he doesn't demand contracts and wages and things of that nature. A goal and an assist for him obviously helped Everton get a wonderful 2-0 victory at Nottingham Forest and he was a huge part of that.\n\nJoelinton (Newcastle): Is there a more dominant midfielder in the Premier League? I'll wait. 6ft 4in, can run all over you, can fight with you but also can do what he did against Burnley and score a goal after two minutes that was worthy of winning any game.\n\nDavid Brooks (Bournemouth): Brooks was the best player on the pitch for me against Chelsea by a country mile. He scored but it was just the way he took Bournemouth up the pitch. There are a lot of eyes on Antoine Semenyo and that he is probably leaving but I just thought that Brooks was fantastic in the way that he carries the ball and he will be the person who carries Bournemouth, not only to safety but to whatever position they end up in this season, it will be on his shoulders.\n\nLeandro Trossard (Arsenal): It's amazing to think that they were going to let him go. There was talk at the start of the season that he was going to be the one to come under the PSR rules. For me, he could be Arsenal's unsung hero of the year. He's now solved that left-sided problem which was an area with Gabriel Martinelli, then they brought Noni Madueke in, they tried Eberechi Eze out there. He's the starting left-sided player, it's just a given. Another goal, an emphatic goal but his work-rate and energy for the team is what's most impressive for me.\n\nYoane Wissa (Newcastle): First goal in two games. He's had a tough start since he got in to Newcastle after being injured but as a spark, he has a willingness to work for his team and an infectious personality that makes everybody else run if he is running. He's always smiling so that's why he gets in the team.\n\nJarrod Bowen (West Ham): When people talk about Bruno Fernandes, the first thing they say is where would Manchester United be without him? Where would West Ham be without Jarrod Bowen over the past five years? Honestly, the guy just keeps performing, takes the brunt of it as the captain and the face of West Ham. He knows what comes with that and the pressures that come with that but he keeps delivering and performing. Another goal for him in the draw with Brighton. If West Ham are to be safe this season, they'll rely on him heavily.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): Unbelievable result. Everyone looking at Arsenal coming up against an Aston Villa team that is in form and flying and looking at it as if they were going to struggle due to Declan Rice being out an a few others. It felt like this was a moment where Arsenal could potentially struggle. They didn't, Arteta found a way to win. It wasn't as easy as the scoreline suggested when you look at the first half chances for Villa. However, it was a massive win and a massive statement, especially when you look at Man City dropping a couple of points away at high-flying Sunderland.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "fullText": "Fulham manager Marco Silva has called for a review of the rules around players needing treatment for head injuries, after his side conceded a goal when temporarily reduced to 10 men in their 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace.\n\nReferee Tony Harrington asked Jorge Cuenca to leave the pitch for treatment after the Fulham defender appeared to put his hands to his face after being caught by a stray arm of Palace's Justin Devenny.\n\nCuenca was unhappy with the referee's decision, but walked off the pitch before play restarted.\n\nOliver Glasner's side then took the lead through a header from Jean-Philippe Mateta just a few seconds later, while Cuenca was waiting on the touchline.\n\nPremier League rules were changed before the 2024-25 season and state that should a player need to leave the field for treatment on a suspected head injury, he must remain off for a minimum of 30 seconds after play has restarted.\n\n\"We conceded a goal when the game was completely under control, and I really believe that at that moment we should not have been playing with 10 men,\" said Silva.\n\n\"Football is to be played 11 against 11. We cannot be always calling the medical stuff when it's not necessary to do it.\n\n\"I told the official because it's happening too often. I think they should review that they should analyse that.\"",

    "fullText": "As the full-time whistle went at Anfield, a goalless draw against Leeds United prompted some boos from sections of the home support.\n\nIt was the first time Liverpool had drawn 0-0 under Arne Slot, and the first result of that scoreline in 117 matches in all competitions, since December 2023 against Manchester United.\n\nLiverpool had not lost and Slot's side had extended their unbeaten run to eight games. But after a largely dull display, it showed a fanbase sharing their frustrations.\n\nFar too often this season, Liverpool have been a tough football team to watch.\n\nIt is not an overstatement to say that the Anfield crowd has been spoiled over the past decade from the Jurgen Klopp era to Slot winning the title in his first year at the club.\n\nThe standards are immensely high and rightly so for a club of this magnitude, but against a Leeds side who got promoted to the Premier League last season, Liverpool looked one-dimensional and lacked the quality to break through the visitors and their 5-4-1 setup.\n\nBar Jeremie Frimpong, who had the pace to move past some of the Leeds players with ease but perhaps lacked that final delivery, there were few moments which got the fans off their seats.\n\nIt was hardly the start to the New Year that Liverpool, Slot or the Anfield faithful would have desired.\n\nOne BBC Sport reader summed up the feelings of the fanbase in our live text.\n\n\"Liverpool still look as though there's a piece missing,\" said Jan from Rye.\n\n\"Heavy metal football this is not - it's not even aluminium foil football.\"",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola questioned whether it was only a two-horse Premier League title race, but his Manchester City side can ill-afford many slip-ups in their quest to hunt down leaders Arsenal.\n\nMikel Arteta's Gunners have struck the latest blow in this cat and mouse chase, four points clear at the summit following City's frustrating goalless draw at Sunderland on Thursday night.\n\nCity dropped points as the temperature at the Stadium of Light almost hit freezing on the first day of 2026.\n\nAnd Arsenal will need to maintain their cool if they are to claim their first top-flight crown in over two decades.\n\nCity had 67% possession and 14 shots in the North East, but were unable to break down a stubborn Sunderland defence who claimed a well-earned point.\n\n\"Two different halves,\" said City captain Bernardo Silva after the game. \"In the first half we didn't play that well. We didn't control the counter as well as we should.\n\n\"We attacked a bit too quick - we didn't move them to find spaces. Second half we had a lot more chances and today was one of those days we couldn't finish them.\n\n\"We are not happy because we wanted better than this.\"\n\nAs goalless draws go, this was an thoroughly entertaining one with both teams having chances to claim all three points.\n\nThe home fans grew in confidence as the match wore on but City could not find the key to unlock the defence as Sunderland maintained their impressive unbeaten record at home this season.\n\n\"If you look at Sunderland's home record I think it's a point well-earned,\" former Manchester City defender Steph Houghton said on BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"They [City] will overall be disappointed because of the chances they created but if you look at the likes of Arsenal and Aston Villa, to go there and get a point, we are half way through the season, there is a long, long way to go.\"\n\nJust like Arsenal in November, City could not beat the Black Cats.\n\nAnd Sunderland boss Regis le Bris was understandably delighted by the result, saying: \"I'm enjoying [it]. I think we showed strong character against probably one of the best teams in Europe at the minute.\n\n\"It was important to defend well. I think we were bold because we tried to be aggressive and high up the pitch. I think we disturbed their routine, maybe their flow and it was really important.\n\n\"We created a few chances as well, so it was a good game.\"",
