    "description": "NFL Films was watching when Tyler Shough and Cam Ward dueled in Week 17. Here's a look at both rookie quarterbacks, who were Mic'd Up on game day.",
    "fullText": "This year's two best rookie competed head to head last week, and they didn't disappoint. New Orleans Saints passer Tyler Shough and Tennessee Titans first overall pick Cam Ward were featured in a Mic'd Up clip from NFL Films to give us a look at each rookie's day at the office. It's clear they both have a strong presence, but you can see why guys are rallying around Shough after the Saints had a rough start to the season.\n\n\"Do your job all day,\" Shough said in the huddle, \"Great feet, great eyes, great technique. Make a play.\"\n\nIt's also clear that Shough has developed great chemistry with his leading wide receiver Chris Olave. He approached Olave on the bench late in regulation to tell him, \"We got to throw the ball to win the game. Throw the ball to win the game so whatever it takes bro.\" After connecting with Olave on a touchdown pass, the pair celebrated all the way back to the bench.\n\n\"Oh my God. Oh my God,\" Shough gasped, leaping to chest-bump Olave. \"I told you I'm gonna get you.\"\n\nShough vs Ward Mic'd Up 🔊\n\nJust 2 rising rookies putting on a clinic@Saints | @Titans | @InsideTheNFL pic.twitter.com/j6bm1njj8t\n\n— NFL Films (@NFLFilms) December 31, 2025\n\nIt's a really cool look at how Shough conducts himself on game days. And from the loud reactions of his offensive linemen and other teammates after big plays, his positive energy is infectious. Win or lose in Week 18's season finale with the Atlanta Falcons, it sure looks like the Saints have found their guy.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: NFL Films features Saints rookie Tyler Shough, Titans QB Cam Ward",

    "description": "The 48th edition of the world's biggest cross-country rally is nearly upon us. Here’s a look at the main contenders for victory in Dakar",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Dakar Rally is shaping up to deliver one of the most closely fought battles in recent years. Ford and Dacia arrive in Saudi Arabia determined to apply the lessons they learned on their debut last year with the aim of ending Toyota’s dominance in the world’s most prestigious rally-raid. Toyota isn’t standing still either, and has introduced an all-new car to maintain its position at the front.\n\nThe rally itself features several changes, with both the route and the format having been altered by organiser ASO to add a fresh challenge.\n\nFollowing the ceremonial start and Prologue on 3 January, competitors will tackle nearly 8,000km across two weeks, crossing some of the most unforgiving terrain in the Middle East.\n\nHere’s a list of drivers considered to be the favourites for top honours in the Ultimate category:\n\nOne of the prime contenders for the 2026 Dakar Rally is reigning champion Yazeed Al-Rajhi. The Saudi billionaire had always been rapid in cross-country rallying, with Dakar’s move to his home country in 2020 cementing his position as a frontrunner. But last year he made the biggest strides, combining his raw pace with improved maturity to secure a maiden win against factory competition. Back at the wheel of a Toyota and supported by the highly experienced Overdrive customer team, he has all the ingredients required to defend his crown.\n\nThat said, the 44-year-old’s build-up to this year’s event has been far from ideal. A heavy crash at Baja Aragon in April left him with fractured vertebrae, forcing a lengthy spell on the sidelines. He returned to competition in Portugal with a subdued 22nd-place finish before his preparations suffered another setback when he retired from Rally Morocco.\n\nToyota’s charge in Dakar will be spearheaded by Henk Lategan. At 31 years of age, he is one of the younger drivers in the field, but with four Dakar appearances already under his belt, he appears ready to finally seal the crown. The South African proved in 2025 that he is capable of fighting for the overall victory, as he went toe-to-toe with the more experienced Al-Rajhi and claimed two individual stage wins along the way. Missing out on the top spot by just under four minutes will have only sharpened his determination to go one better this time around.\n\nToyota has a new weapon in Dakar this year in the form of the GR DKR Hilux, which features a lighter tubular chassis and reinforced transmission. The Japanese manufacturer has won Dakar three times in the last four years, and the updated model based on the Hilux pick-up will help stave off competition from newer rivals.\n\nIf there is one driver the Dakar field can never afford to underestimate, it is Nasser Al-Attiyah. The Qatari has been a relentless winning force over the past decade and arrives in 2026 determined to reclaim the crown after two comparatively difficult campaigns in 2024 and 2025. While Stephane Peterhansel’s record of eight outright victories in cars remains some distance away, Al-Attiyah could enhance his legacy by winning the rally with a fourth different manufacturer after his previous triumphs with Volkswagen, Mini and Toyota. Further, he is just one stage win away from leapfrogging both Peterhansel and Ari Vatanen to become the most successful Dakar driver in that metric.\n\nAl-Attiyah will also be able to benefit from an improved Dacia Sandrider, which won in both Abu Dhabi and Morocco last year after a rather underwhelming debut in Dakar at the start of the 2025 season.\n\nCarlos Sainz Sr. shows no signs of slowing as he prepares for his 19th Dakar Rally start at the age of 63. Sainz became the oldest driver to win the world’s most prestigious cross-country rally when he won the 2024 edition at the wheel of the Audi RS Q e-tron. His 2025 outing was cut short by a crash on Stage 2, but he is back this year to gun for a fifth overall victory.\n\nWinning Dakar with Ford would bring his career a full circle, having made his WRC debut back in 1987 at the wheel of a Cosworth-powered Sierra. Sainz also never managed to win a WRC title with the American marque (his 1990 and ‘92 championships were won with Toyota), so a Dakar triumph with Raptor would be one of the most satisfying achievements of his illustrious career.\n\nRally legend Sebastien Loeb arrives at Dakar with renewed momentum after closing out the 2025 World Rally-Raid Championship with three consecutive podiums, including a victory in the season-ending Morocco Rally. That should give him some encouragement after his most recent Dakar outing ended early due to car damage. Loeb will also have a new co-driver in the form of Al-Attiyah’s former navigator Edouard Boulanger. After a run of misfortune earlier in 2025, Loeb felt a reset was required, leading to a split with Fabian Lurquin, who has moved across to partner Al-Attiyah in a direct swap between the pair.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Dacia can build on its recent success and take on Toyota on the biggest stage, but a maiden Dakar victory for Loeb would be huge for his career, especially after Sebastien Ogier drew level with him on nine World Rally Championship titles in 2025.\n\nMattias Ekstrom’s recent Dakar form has been so convincing that he is now viewed less as a two-time DTM champion and more as a genuine rally-raid specialist. The Swede has shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new disciplines, a trait underlined in 2022 when he beat his more experienced Audi team-mates to finish ninth overall on debut.\n\nThat adaptability was again on display in 2025 when, after ending a decades-long association with Audi, he guided the factory Ford team to the podium, finishing behind only the dominant Toyotas of Al-Rajhi and Lategan.\n\nHow Ekstrom builds on that impressive performance will be one of the key storylines in 2026, particularly if Ford can produce a package capable of taking the Hilux head-on in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBeyond the established leading sextet, several other drivers on the entry list are capable of springing a surprise in 2026. Toyota driver Seth Quintero, for instance, will be a much more potent force in his third outing in the Ultimate category. Also stepping into a bigger role is two-time bike champion Toby Price, whose impressive Dakar debut in the car category with Overdrive last year earned him a promotion to Toyota’s factory line-up.\n\nAnother driver to watch out for is Lucas Moraes, who won the 2025 W2RC title with Toyota and has since joined an expanded four-car Dacia operation alongside Al-Attiyah, Loeb and Cristina Gutierrez.\n\nFord’s young gun Mitch Guthrie complemented Ekstrom well in 2025 and looks well placed to challenge for individual stage wins this year. His team-mate Nani Roma, a Dakar winner on both two and four wheels, should also never be discounted.\n\nOutside of Toyota, Ford and Dacia, two smaller manufacturers could regularly mix in the top 10 this year: Century and Mini. At Century, Matthieu Serradori and Brian Baragwanath have a history of punching above their team’s weight, while Mini also fields proven talents like Guillaume de Mevius and Lionel Baud.\n\nFinally, ‘Mr Dakar’ Peterhansel will also line up at the start in Yanbu on 3 January after missing the event in 2025, competing for Land Rover’s Defender brand in the Stock class.\n\nDakar 2026: Full route, schedule and marathon stage details\n\nRed Bull co-owner Mark Mateschitz to enter Dakar Rally under an alias\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Wales head coach Craig Bellamy is attracting interest from clubs – but Football Association of Wales (FAW) chief executive Noel Mooney hopes the man he describes as a \"genius\" will stay until Euro 2028.\n\nAfter being linked with the Celtic job following Brendan Rodgers' departure in October, Bellamy said he was \"fully committed\" to Wales.\n\nThe 46-year-old signed a four-year contract when he was appointed Wales boss in July 2024 and has impressed in his first senior managerial role.\n\nUnder Bellamy, Wales have earned promotion to the Nations League top flight and, if they win their World Cup play-off semi-final and final in March, they will qualify for next summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBellamy has also introduced a bold and attacking new style of play, which has caught the attention of club sides – if not a formal approach, according to Mooney.\n\n\"No [approach] but there's interest around Craig. Wherever I go you hear that because of the way he plays football,\" Mooney told BBC Sport Wales.\n\n\"If I was the CEO of a football club and I wanted to play beautiful, expansive football, I'd be looking at him to be frank because he is just such a good coach and he's got a backroom team around him that's fabulous as well.\n\n\"It's natural he's going to create interest in the future. We're completely prepared for that.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool and Manchester City forward Bellamy earned 78 caps for Wales and scored 19 goals but never represented his country at a major tournament.\n\nThat is a major factor in his burning desire to take Wales to the 2026 World Cup, and he has said that managing the national team at Euro 2028 on home soil is a \"massive\" incentive.\n\nWales will co-host Euro 2028 alongside England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, with Cardiff's Principality Stadium staging the opening fixture.\n\n\"I was with him at the rugby when Wales played the All Blacks [in November] and we're just looking around the stadium together, thinking when we kick off Euro 2028 in this stadium as a full house, that'll be another chapter for Welsh football,\" said Mooney.\n\n\"So as part of the legacy that he wants to leave for Welsh football, we would love him to stay to Euro 2028 and to lead the team.\n\n\"He's really enthusiastic about that. We live in the real world as well. If someone comes on and offers him, I don't know, the Real Madrid job or Barcelona job or the Liverpool job, whatever it is, then naturally that's interesting for anybody.\n\n\"I mean he's competitive, he's got to the very top of the game on the pitch, naturally off the pitch, he's going to want to get to the very top.\n\n\"If he plays football like we did against North Macedonia [who Wales beat 7-1 in November] then any club out there that wants to play good football and wants a brilliant young coach, I'd be surprised if he's not on their radar.\"\n\nCeltic job 'not on my radar' - Wales boss Bellamy\n\nEuro 2028 bid a 'massive' motivation for Bellamy",

    "fullText": "Good morning Gang Green Nation! The New York Jets will be on the road to face the Buffalo Bills in the last game of the regular season on Sunday. Josh Allen has not been practicing this week and is not expected to play on Sunday. For tank commanders that may cause some concern. Certainly the Jets’ chances of an upset improve with Allen out. However, the Bills still have a substantial edge at quarterback with Mitchell Trubisky under center compared to the Jets with Brady Cook under center.

    "description": "The Japanese righty signed with the Astros, taking another SP candidate off the board for the Birds.",
    "fullText": "In the Orioles’ pursuit of a big-name starting pitcher, one major candidate just came off the board. Nippon Professional Baseball standout Tatsuya Imai reportedly will sign with the Houston Astros on a three-year, $54 million contract that includes opt-outs after every season.\n\nIt’s one of the most surprising free agent deals of the offseason, not only because it’s the Astros — a team that has little history in the Japanese market, with only one previous signing from the country — but also because Imai ended up with a contract worth a fraction of what some analysts predicted. The Athletic projected that the right-hander would land an eight-year, $190 million deal, while MLB Trade Rumors pegged him for six years and $150 million. But the 27-year-old — whose posting period was set to expire today — apparently didn’t get the offers he’d hoped for. Now he’ll hope to prove himself in his debut season in the U.S. and perhaps opt out and cash in a bigger payday next winter.\n\nMy first thought is that the Orioles easily could have topped the Astros’ offer if they wanted to. But so could a lot of other teams. And the fact that nobody did so (as far as we know) indicates that MLB front offices just aren’t sold on Imai’s chances of transferring his NPB success to the majors. Imai can hit 99 mph on his fastball but has faced some concerns about his secondary pitches and his control, with some scouts seeing him as more of a back-end starter type rather than an ace.\n\nThe Athletic’s Keith Law is one of the low guys on the totem pole on Imai, ranking him only 31st on his top 50 free agent list, behind such starting pitchers as Zac Gallen, Justin Verlander, and Chris Bassitt — and Zach Eflin, whom the O’s have already re-signed. Law writes that Imai is “probably a mid-rotation starter” who has “the downside of a guy who’s going to allow too much hard contact on the heater to stay a starter.”\n\nSo, yes, there are some risks with Imai. But I would’ve been happy to overlook those risks if the Orioles had been the ones to sign him. It would’ve been the Birds’ boldest excursion into the Far East market yet, and certainly would’ve boosted the depth of the rotation, even if Imai isn’t a #1 or #2 type of starter. The O’s, though, seem to have decided that Imai wasn’t the right pitcher to target, or maybe he wasn’t interested in coming to Baltimore.\n\nThe Orioles will need to look elsewhere for a rotation upgrade. The Astros’ signing of Imai could close the book on their chances of re-signing their longtime ace Framber Valdez, and perhaps the O’s are an intriguing fit for him, especially considering Mike Elias’s previous ties to Valdez during his Houston tenure. Ranger Suárez remains on the market, as do some of the mid-tier guys like Gallen and Bassitt.\n\nIt just feels like the O’s are still one arm away from a complete offseason. And now we know that arm won’t be Imai’s.\n\nOrioles free agent targets: Comparing Framber Valdez vs. Ranger Suárez – The Baltimore Sun\n\nMatt Weyrich gives the tale of tape between Valdez and Suárez. Ah, I can’t decide. Might as well just sign them both.\n\nShould Orioles bring back Danny Coulombe? | MAILBAG – BaltimoreBaseball.com\n\nThe Orioles’ bizarre decision to decline Coulombe’s option was one of their many blunders last offseason. I’d be happy to bring him back, but the O’s seem to have decided they’re not interested for whatever reason.\n\nStarting the New Year on an optimistic note – Steve Melewski\n\nMelewski offers some reasons to be excited already about the 2026 Orioles. I’ll admit the team does look good on paper, but I’m still too scarred by 2025 to dare to be truly optimistic.\n\n1 prediction for every club in ’26 – MLB.com\n\nOrioles beat writer Jake Rill predicts the O’s will return to the postseason this year. It’s Optimism City in Birdland these days, apparently.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! And happy 28th birthday to Kyle Stowers, whom the O’s dealt in the Trevor Rogers trade in 2024. In his first season with everyday playing time, Stowers broke out as an NL All-Star for the Marlins last year, hitting 25 homers and OPS’ing .912 in 117 games. Congrats to Kyle on his success, and considering the season that Rogers just had for the Orioles, I’d say that trade has worked out well for both sides.\n\nOther ex-Orioles born on Jan. 2 include two right-handers named Garrett — Reed Garrett (33) and Maryland native Garrett Stephenson (54) — and outfielder Royle Stillman (75).\n\nOn this date in 2019, the Orioles hired Koby Perez as their senior director of international scouting, their first hire for that position under new general manager Mike Elias. Seven years later, Perez now has the title of vice president of international scouting and operations, and has helped the O’s set up an international talent pipeline that developed Samuel Basallo, among others.",

    "description": "The marathon is over. Sunday marks the end of the NFL regular season. In recent years, Week 18 has signaled the end for the Chicago Bears. Not so this year. For the first time since 2020, the Bears are headed to the postseason.",
    "fullText": "The marathon is over. Sunday marks the end of the NFL regular season.\n\nIn recent years, Week 18 has signaled the end for the Chicago Bears. Not so this year. For the first time since 2020, the Bears are headed to the postseason. They have bigger goals on the horizon, starting with next week’s wild-card round of the playoffs.\n\nBut first, they have a matchup with the Detroit Lions. Sunday’s game has playoff implications. The simplest result is this: Win Sunday and they lock up the No. 2 seed in the NFC and a matchup with the No. 7 Green Bay Packers. A loss complicates matters a little, but the Bears are at least guaranteed a home game as NFC North champions.\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson already has declared his team is “playing to win.” Lions coach Dan Campbell said his squad will be competing, despite the fact they have nothing left to play for.\n\nThe Bears (11-5) square off against the Lions (8-8) on Sunday at Soldier Field (3:25 p.m., Fox-32). Here are five things to watch ahead of Week 18 — plus the Tribune’s predictions for the game.\n\nThe NFL season is a brutal, physical journey from the time training camp starts in July until the playoffs in January.\n\n“This is a race,” Johnson said on the day training camp began in July. The Bears are nearly at the end of the race now, and it has been a marathon more than a sprint.\n\nJust think about where the Bears and the Lions were nearly four months ago. In Week 2, the Lions cruised to a 52-21 win over the Bears at Ford Field. The Bears fell to 0-2, while the Lions looked like the team that won 15 games a year ago.\n\n“It’s early in the season and you’re still getting to know your team a little bit,” Johnson said this week as he reflected on that game. “Being in that locker room after that game and how that felt — you don’t always remember exactly what was said or anything like that, but you always remember how you felt in those moments.”\n\nMuch has changed in the 15 weeks since then. The Bears are gearing up for a playoff run, and the Lions will be watching the postseason from home. Things change rapidly in the NFL. After that loss in Detroit, the Bears won their next four games and nine of 10.\n\nThe Lions, on the other hand, started the season 7-4 and in a favorable position before losing four of the next five. A Christmas Day loss in Minnesota eliminated the Lions from postseason contention.\n\nCampbell suggested the Lions will play their starters, but he left some gray area with regard to players battling injury, which includes top receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and tackle Penei Sewell.\n\n“I think if it’s — we’re sitting there borderline, and the player, it could be hard (to play) or we think they’re setting themselves up for a long-term risk, then no, it’s not worth it,” Campbell told members of the Detroit media.\n\nWilliams needs 109 passing yards to break the Bears’ single-season record. Erik Kramer set the mark with 3,838 yards in 1995. Jay Cutler came close to topping it with 3,812 yards in 2014, but the record has stood for 30 years.\n\nChicago Bears QB Caleb Williams on 4,000 yards: ‘I was brought here for those types of things’\n\nWilliams has surpassed 109 passing yards in every game this season. Also in play is a 4,000-yard season, something no Bears quarterback has done. Ever. With 3,730 yards this season, Williams needs 270 to reach the milestone.\n\nThe primary goal remains to win the game. But Williams said this week that he believes he’s in Chicago to rewrite the record books at the quarterback position.\n\n“In 100 or however many years, it has never been done,” Williams said. “So it symbolizes something.”\n\nWilliams has played some of his best football over the last three games. In wins against the Cleveland Browns and Packers and a road loss to the San Francisco 49ers, he has averaged 274 passing yards with six touchdown passes and zero interceptions.\n\n“I’m playing better than I have,” Williams said. “These last three games, but even going back to some of the other games, some of the stats may not show it, but I feel that I’m playing better. I said it’s going to start showing here soon, and that’s a small sample of that. I’ve got to keep growing, keep getting better.”\n\nAbout that Week 2 beatdown in Detroit …\n\nThat’s exactly the type of game that the old Bears would’ve let bleed into the next week. A year ago, this same franchise lost on a brutal Hail Mary at Washington and went on to lose 10 consecutive games. Losing became inevitable.\n\nWhile the early-season loss in Detroit might have felt like a “here we go again” moment, Johnson has never let his team think too much about any one game.\n\n“That can kind of go one or two ways after that, right?” linebacker T.J. Edwards said. “And I think that shows where we’re at right now … having that belief in one another. It’s rare to have in a team where everyone is on the same page and everyone is understanding what we’re trying to get done. When those things are going wrong, it allows us to come together and make sure that it doesn’t stay that way.”\n\nColumn: Chicago Bears are ‘moving on to Detroit’ — but they won’t go far in playoffs if defense doesn’t improve\n\nIt’s a pertinent message this week, when the Bears are looking to brush off Sunday night’s loss in San Francisco. The Bears have built all sorts of momentum this season. They’ve been, all things considered, relatively healthy. Although the defense struggled against the 49ers, the team has played well overall during the toughest part of the schedule down the stretch.\n\n“It kind of just goes with Ben’s messaging every week,” Edwards said. “He’s been the same. He’s been consistent. So it’s easy for us to kind of follow. But it’s a week-to-week league, right? So after big wins, celebrate for a second and then you’ve got to get back to work, and after big losses it’s no different because there’s another one coming up.”\n\nThe Bears want to head into the postseason on a positive note. A win against the Lions would do that.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Commanders will also kick off at 3:25 p.m. If the Bears lose Sunday and the Eagles win, the Eagles would jump the Bears for the No. 2 seed, dropping the Bears to No. 3.\n\nThe No. 2 seed will play the Packers, who are locked in at No. 7. The No. 3 seed will play someone from the NFC West, either the 49ers or Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe Bears probably would rather take their chances against the Packers, a team they’ve played close twice already, winning once in dramatic fashion. The No. 2 seed also would play at home in the divisional round if it wins its first playoff game.\n\nReports out of Philadelphia have suggested the Eagles might sit their starters Sunday. That will be a situation to monitor. The Commanders, though, could start third-string quarterback Josh Johnson, so anything could happen even if the Eagles rest up for the playoffs.\n\nJohnson has said the Bears are playing to win, but might that change if the Eagles are down by two touchdowns at halftime?\n\nOdunze has missed four games with a foot injury. The Bears receiver hasn’t played since Nov. 28 in Philadelphia. Odunze has not participated in practice this week.\n\n“We’ll see how this week goes,” Johnson said when asked about Odunze.\n\nRookie receiver Luther Burden III suffered a quad injury on the last play against the 49ers but has been back on the practice field this week. That’s a good sign for the Bears.\n\nIn Detroit, a number of key starters have been on the injury report, including linebacker Alex Anzalone (concussion), defensive tackle Alim McNeill (abdomen), Sewell (ankle), St. Brown (knee/ankle) and left tackle Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness).\n\nBoth teams will release one more injury report Friday.\n\nThe Bears are looking to tighten things up defensively after a woeful showing in San Francisco and along come the Lions, who have some key injury concerns on offense involving wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and left tackle Taylor Decker, among others. Injuries also have rocked the Lions secondary, and opposing quarterbacks, with the exception of Minnesota Vikings undrafted rookie Max Brosmer last week, have lit up the Lions of late. The Bears have plenty of motivation with the No. 2 seed in the NFC there for the taking, even with reports that the Eagles, also in contention for that seed, are expected to rest key players for their finale against the Commanders.\n\nWeek 18 is weird. But I’m going to take Johnson’s word when he says the Bears are playing to win. I’m not convinced the Lions truly are, no matter what they say. They have nothing to play for. Beyond Week 18 weirdness, though, the Bears have shown in the second half of the season that they’re the better team. I think they cap off a remarkable turnaround with win No. 12.\n\nThe Lions are fizzling to a disappointing finish. The Bears have several incentives in this rematch: Secure the No. 2 seed, redeem the loss of a winnable game against the 49ers and avenge Week 2’s blowout loss in which the Lions ran up the score (don’t let anyone convince you otherwise). The Bears need to sharpen all phases heading into the playoffs, and the injury-riddled Lions look like sacrificial lambs.",

    "fullText": "Dolphins predicted to replace Tua Tagovailoa with $180 million Pro Bowl quarterback originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins will wrap up their 2025 season on Sunday when they take on the New England Patriots in Week 18. Miami has had quite the eventful season for more bad reasons than good, which sets up a very interesting offseason for Miami.\n\nThe Dolphins fired general manager Chris Grier in the middle of the season, and head coach Mike McDaniel benched Tua Tagovailoa after the team's Week 15 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, which all but ends his tenure in Miami. If that is the case, Miami will need a new starter at quarterback, which they could address in the NFL Draft or with a signing/trade. Kristopher Knox of Bleacher Report weighs in on the matter and says Kirk Cousins to Miami would make sense.\n\n\"Regardless of McDaniels' fate, it feels like Miami is out on Tua Tagovailoa, who was benched for Ewers for performance reasons,\" Knox writes. \"Offloading Tagovailoa's contract this coming offseason won't be easy, as it will contain $56.4 million in dead money, but if the Dolphins can do it, they may need a veteran QB to at least push Ewers. Cousins could do exactly that, and he could feel good enough about his chances of beating out the Texas product that he'd sign off on a trade to South Beach. It's also worth noting that McDaniel was on the Washington Commanders' staff during Cousins' first two seasons in the NFL.\"\n\nCousins has started seven games in 2025 after Michael Penix went down with a torn ACL. The four-time Pro Bowler was signed by Atlanta in 2024 to a $180 million deal and was benched at the tail end of the 2024 season. If given the right offense, we've seen what Cousins is capable of. With Jaylen Waddle and De'Von Achane as proven commodities, Miami could do a lot worse than signing Cousins once he is released, which is heavily expected.\n\nDolphins seek help from ESPN broadcaster in general manager search\n\nDolphins seek help from ESPN broadcaster in general manager search\n\nGiants reportedly targeting former Coach of the Year as their next head coach\n\nBlockbuster trade proposal sends $106 million star to Buffalo Bills\n\nBears projected to steal AFC running back with $34 million contract",

    "fullText": "Kings’ Doug Christie finds silver lining from loss to Celtics appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Sacramento Kings may have the bleakest outlook of any team in the NBA; even their peers at the bottom of the standings have slivers of hope to hold on to. Meanwhile, the Kings have a roster that doesn’t make sense all while having logjams at nearly every position and having injury problems afflicting a few of their key players. To start off the new calendar year, Sacramento lost once more, suffering their third consecutive defeat in a 120-106 loss to the Boston Celtics.\n\nTry as the Kings might, this roster is simply a hodgepodge that they have to move on from to truly begin their rebuild. Even some of the decisions that head coach Doug Christie has been making have been head-scratching, such as de-prioritizing Keon Ellis and Nique Clifford as well as relegating big-money free-agent signing Dennis Schroder to a bench role.\n\nBut if it’s any consolation, the Kings head coach is recognizing better effort from his team as they look towards starting off 2026 on a better note than they did on Thursday.\n\n“The compete level and the standard that we’re looking for was much, much better,” Christie said, per Brenden Nunes of Sactown Sports 1140.\n\nThere is going to be not much rest for these weary Kings as they face the Phoenix Suns on the road later tonight at 9:00 PM E.T.\n\nThe Kings are in a bit of a transition period at the moment, but it’s clear that eventually, they will have to blow up this roster. They’re going to have to embrace the youth movement at some point and perhaps build around Domantas Sabonis, the star they chose to keep instead of De’Aaron Fox.\n\nIt will be up to the Kings’ ownership, however, if they will permit the team’s need to start over. But for the team’s sake, they will have to do so.",

    "fullText": "Nets’ Jordi Fernandez calls for Cam Thomas to do more outside of scoring appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Brooklyn Nets were down a few key guys on New Year’s Day, so it wasn’t a surprise to see them suffer a blowout defeat to the Houston Rockets, a 120-96 loss to begin the new calendar year. Their starting lineup sans Michael Porter Jr. just couldn’t get anything going on offense, which should not have come as a surprise to anyone as well considering that Cam Thomas was left on the bench to start off proceedings.\n\nThomas, in his 23 minutes off the bench, still ended up leading the team in scoring with 21 on 8-13 shooting. He is clearly the best shot creator on the Nets roster, and the 24-year-old guard doesn’t seem to be relishing his reduced role on the team. But the Nets’ demands of him are crystal clear; head coach Jordi Fernandez simply wants Thomas to be a more impactful overall player instead of just filling up one column of the box score.\n\n“Good scoring punch with the minutes that he’s playing… Obviously, his superpower is his scoring, but once again, I need better defense, I need better playmaking,” Fernandez said of Thomas in his postgame presser, via ClutchPoints Nets beat reporter Erik Slater.\n\nJordi Fernandez on Cam Thomas' performance tonight:\n\n“Good scoring punch with the minutes that he’s playing… Obviously, his superpower is his scoring, but once again, I need better defense, I need better playmaking.” pic.twitter.com/OAeW5wXY1z\n\n— Erik Slater (@erikslater_) January 2, 2026\n\nFor all of the demands anyone can ask of Thomas, it may just be easier to accept that this is the kind of player he is: a microwave scorer who can provide instant offense for a team that needs some scoring help. Thomas certainly has the makings of someone who can be a winning player, but the Nets aren’t exactly willing to give it time to see whether or not he can be part of the next winning team in Brooklyn.\n\nAnd with Thomas refusing to commit his future to the Nets franchise, instead choosing to accept the qualifying offer which has him on course to enter unrestricted free agency at year’s end, Brooklyn has no reason to prioritize him anyway.",

    "title": "Should Romero have been sent off against Brentford?",
    "description": "Should Tottenham's Cristian Romero have been sent off for bringing down Brentford's Igor Thiago when the striker was through on goal?",
    "fullText": "Keith Andrews was far from happy after Tottenham defender Cristian Romero escaped a red card in the 0-0 draw on New Year's Day.\n\nThe Brentford manager was adamant Romero should have been sent off for bringing down Igor Thiago when the striker was running through on goal.\n\nRomero did not even concede a free-kick let alone be shown a card.\n\nAndrew said in his post-match news conference that it was \"a blatant red card\" because \"Thiago was stopped from getting to the ball\".\n\nYou can see Andrews' point. Romero made a wild swing at the ball to try to intercept a pass. In doing so, Thiago was brought down.\n\nWhen play has continued the video assistant referee (VAR), Alex Chilowicz, has two things to consider. Firstly, was the foul itself a clear and obvious error and then was it definitely a denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO).\n\nThe VAR cannot intervene purely on the free-kick, it has to be both a foul and a red card.\n\nRomero brought his left leg across the Brentford player, creating a barrier and halting his progress.\n\nIt is hard to argue against a foul so why did the on-field officials not give it?\n\nFrom their perspective it could have looked like Romero hooked the ball because he came away in possession. But this was a result of momentum rather than an executed challenge.\n\nThat leaves the VAR to consider DOGSO.\n\nWhen assessing DOGSO referees are told to imagine the scenario without the defender at the point of the foul.\n\nThe ball was in front of Thiago, there was no other defender in close proximity and play was a few yards outside the area.\n\nThiago would surely have collected the ball, run forward a few yards and taken a shot.\n\nThat Romero came away with the ball has probably given the VAR some doubts that Thiago would take control. It gave the perception that play would not have continued forward.\n\nHowever, this happens after the foul and the ball only stopped because Romero landed on it. A DOGSO red card appears to be the more logical outcome.\n\nWhile the ball did touch Romero's arm it was accidental and would not be considered handball.\n\nIt could have been Romero's third red card in under a month.\n\nAndrews was annoyed that Romero was not sent off when the two teams met on 6 December. Again the Argentine defender had made a challenge on Thiago.\n\nIt was a scissors-style tackle which Andrews felt was a \"very easy one\" for the officials.\n\nThe Premier League's Key Match Incidents Panel voted 3-2 that Romero should have been sent off by referee Rob Jones. But it was a 4-1 vote that the VAR, Tim Wood, was right not to intervene and advise a red card.\n\nRomero was sent off for two yellow cards against Liverpool on 20 December.\n\nOn one side of the argument is that players go to ground too easily trying to get decisions. The other is that if you do not go down you won't get a foul.\n\nHugo Ekitike broke through into the area under pressure from Leeds defender Jaka Bijol in New Year's Day's 0-0 draw.\n\nBijol had arms around the Liverpool striker, who stayed on his feet and tried to get a shot away. Ekitike was crowded out and did not manage a shot.\n\n\"I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that one of my players stay on their feet,\" Liverpool boss Arne Slot said.\n\n\"It's just a team who we are and unfortunately it's not recognised. The questions is, should we change or not? I don't think we should.\n\n\"If he goes down it probably would have been a red card and a penalty and that would have increased our chances of winning.\"\n\nBijol was saved from a VAR review because he was not holding the Germany international in a conventional sense. That means by tugging the shirt or dragging the opponent back.\n\nA VAR, in this case Darren England, always has to assess impact. That is far more difficult if a player does not go down. So by its very nature a player who stays up is less likely to get a decision.\n\nIf Ekitike had gone down, proving that he had been impacted, it may well have been a penalty and a red card for DOGSO.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "According to a report from AS, Real Madrid scouts will closely monitor Kees Smit over the next six months before the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIt is known that the AZ Alkmaar youngster is being followed as part of Madrid’s wider plan to identify a midfield orchestrator capable of leading the team into the next cycle.\n\nAs mentioned many times in the past, Real Madrid are preparing to reinforce their midfield in the summer of 2026.\n\nWith that objective in mind, Smit has emerged as a profile that fits many of the club’s requirements.\n\nOver recent weeks, his name has gathered serious traction among scouts, not just in Spain but across Europe.\n\nCompetition for Smit’s signature is expected to be fierce.\n\nSeveral top clubs are aware of his rapid development, but Real Madrid believe their sporting project and global pull could be decisive if they choose to make a concrete move.\n\nThe club see him as a player who is young enough to grow, yet already mature enough to handle responsibility at the highest level.\n\nReal Madrid will keep an eye on Kees Smit. (Photo by Richard Pelham/Getty Images)\n\nAt just 19 years old, Smit has already taken important steps forward in his career. He has made his debut for the Dutch national team under Ronald Koeman, who is counting on him as part of his plans heading into the World Cup.\n\nKoeman’s faith has been telling, and comparisons to Pedri only underline the type of midfielder Smit is becoming.\n\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid’s interest is not new. Club scouts were first drawn to Smit during a Youth League match in the 2022–23 season, when AZ Alkmaar convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0.\n\nThat performance sparked sustained monitoring of his progress, and since then, his development has only reinforced the initial impressions.\n\nFrom now until the end of the season, the evaluation process will intensify. Madrid intend to observe him continuously, analysing not only his performances but also his consistency, personality, and response to pressure.\n\nHowever, under contract until 2028, AZ Alkmaar currently value him at around €60 million.\n\nIt is already a hefty figure for a player who turns 20 on January 21, but one that could climb even higher with strong international exposure.",

    "fullText": "Barring a 488-yard performance from RJ Harvey on Sunday, the Denver Broncos are on the verge of a sixth-straight season without a 1,000-yard rusher, the third-longest active streak in the NFL.\n\nHarvey has 863 yards from scrimmage and 12 total touchdowns this season, but his rushing total stands at 512 yards. Going up against L.A.'s top-ten run defense, Harvey is unlikely to hit 1,000 rushing yards as a rookie.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins was well on his way to 1,000 with 772 yards through 10 games until he suffered a foot injury. Before that injury, Dobbins was on pace for a 1,312-yard season in 2025.\n\nDenver's leading rushers over the past six years were Dobbins (772), Javonte Williams (513), Williams (774), Latavius Murray (703), Melvin Gordon (918) and Gordon (986). The team's last 1,000-yard rusher was Phillip Lindsay, who totaled 1,011 yards on the ground in 2019.\n\nDobbins is currently scheduled to become a free agent in 2026. If he re-signs, Dobbins would get an opportunity to hit 1,000 yards next season. Otherwise, Harvey would be in line to take over RB1 duties.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Broncos have another season without 1,000-yard rusher",

He spent two seasons with the Yellow Jackets recording over 700 yards in both seasons. This year with the Tigers he finished with 534 yards receiving on 57 receptions and three touchdowns. Singleton career totals were 2,002 yards receiving on 162 receptions and 12 receiving touchdowns.\n\nHugh Freeze's offense never seemed to fully unlock Singleton's potential at Auburn. The junior wide receiver had his lowest receiving and total yards at Auburn. Singleton did see a uptick after the Freeze firing and offensive coordinator Derrick Nix took over play calling. Against Vanderbilt, he hauled in 11 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown\n\nPreseason CBS Sports ranked him a top-10 receiver in the 2026 draft. Singleton's draft stock could rise in the coming months at the NFL Combine with a chance to showcase his speed and route running ability.\n\nContact/Follow us @TheAuburnWire on  X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Auburn news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "There are only a few more games before the college football season ends, and one of them will feature the Oregon Ducks. They advanced to the College Football Playoff Semifinals today and will take on a team they’ve already lost to this season, the Indiana Hoosiers.\n\nBoth of these teams won their games in convincing fashion and when they met earlier in the season, the Ducks lost by 10 points in a game that was closer than the final score indicated. Much like the Texas Tech Red Raiders, who Oregon just mopped the floor with, the Ducks and the Hoosiers have a ton of similarities that lead you to believe it will be a tightly-contested game.\n\nThis is reflected in the betting odds for the game, with FanDuel Sportsbook currently setting the spread at plus-3 1/2 for the Ducks, just their second time being an underdog this season. The moneyline odds opened up at plus-158 for Oregon and minus-192 for Indiana, with the point total set at 47 1/2.\n\nOne of the best games we’ve seen this season was the Ducks and the Hoosiers, and now they will meet again in the playoffs as arguably the two best teams in the nation, regardless of seeding. These lines are sure to move between now and next Friday, but for now, bettors are expecting this to be close, low-scoring game.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Oregon Ducks open as slight underdogs vs. Indiana in CFP Semifinals",

    "fullText": "The transfer portal is open, and Texas A&M head coach Mike Elko will have plenty to consider on both sides of the ball, which will include adding another wide receiver after KC Concepcion announced his intention to enter the 2026 NFL Draft, a decision that was not surprising given his elite performance during the 2025 season.\n\nWhile Concepcion's playmaking ability will be missed, the Aggies need to find a true X receiver with the height, length, and catch radius to shore up the red zone offense, allowing starting quarterback Marcel Reed to continue improving as a pocket passer, and provide more confidence with another playmaker to utilize through the air.\n\nThis week, the news that Auburn star wide receiver Cam Coleman planned to enter the transfer portal was shocking to say the least. While the Aggies have been directly connected to the standout pass catcher, several intriguing names have entered the portal, including Texas wide receiver Parker Livingstone and Rutgers wideout Ian Strong, who both fit that X receiver mold.\n\nLivingstone's departure was surprising after finishing his redshirt freshman season with 516 yards and six receiving touchdowns. At the same time, his close friendship with starting quarterback Arch Manning helped create one of the better connections. Does this mean the Longhorns are freeing up space to pursue Cam Coleman? Possibly, but nothing has been reported.\n\nIan Strong is another solid option, standing at 6'3\", and totaled 95 receptions for 1,438 yards and 10 touchdowns during his last two seasons at Rutgers. Aggie fans will remember wide receiver Caleb Chapman, who, despite his injury issues, was one of the more reliable deep threats because of his stature and long-strider speed, which has been missing from the A&M passing attack since Noah Thomas transferred to Georgia.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M has two more intriguing transfer wide receivers to consider",

    "description": "During Thursday's press conference, Kansas City Chiefs coordinator Matt Nagy evaluated the offense heading into the season finale | @EdEastonJr",
    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy spoke with reporters during his recent press conference, discussing the expectations for the offense heading into Week 18 and looking ahead to next season.\n\n\"The biggest thing for us that we've been really focusing on, and this is not just offense but as a team, is win. Do everything we can to win,\" said Nagy, \"As an offense, our part of it is making sure that we understand that this part of the season, going into the final game, it's been a while since we've been in this territory, mentally as you go through the week of the prep stuff and then different players in different positions playing, that sort of thing. So, no matter who it is, the one common denominator is we have the same schedule throughout the week, with the practices, the same mindset for us of going in and trying to do everything we can to play well and win.\"\n\nThe Chiefs' offense has struggled with consistency and big plays all season, even when Patrick Mahomes was healthy. Nagy believes in the team's future as he tries to piece together what went wrong in 2025.\n\n\"Big picture offensively for us is I think all of us understanding that the season didn't go as we wanted to in the end. There were parts of the year in the middle of the season where we felt like – and I think I brought this up to you before, we really felt like we were at a peak level offensively,\" said Nagy, \"Unfortunately, it didn't last all the way through the year. Now here we are at the end of the year playing in this game that is important to us to finish strong, and it's our job to do that, to coach strong players to play strong, and then in the end, win. I think the last several games didn't go how we wanted, but we want to finish on a high note.\"\n\nKansas City's lone touchdown in Week 17 was led by quarterback Chris Oladokun, who completed 13-of-22 passes for 66 yards and a touchdown. He connected with running back Brashard Smith for a 5-yard score early in the second quarter.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs OC Matt Nagy evaluates offense heading into the season finale",

He’ll end his career with 11 tackles and a forced fumble.\n\nMukam saw the field plenty this fall, and does have plenty of potential to be a difference maker, but it won’t happen with Notre Dame.

    "description": "Can Jordan Magee replace Bobby Wagner in the middle of the Commanders' defense in 2026? That's a key offseason question.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders have plenty of holes to fill this upcoming offseason. While Washington needs to add another starting receiver, perhaps a tight end, and a running back, the Commanders have their quarterback and an offensive line to build around.\n\nIt's another story on defense. Washington needs plenty of help. Fortunately, the Commanders have the cap space to be active in free agency and a top-seven pick in the 2026 NFL draft to help improve the defense.\n\nOne question GM Adam Peters and head coach Dan Quinn must resolve before the offseason begins is how many young defenders can step into a starting role next season? One name comes to mind: linebacker Jordan Magee.\n\nThe second-year linebacker from Temple has seen increased snaps on defense this season. Magee has played in every game for Washington this season, making seven starts. With the Commanders using Frankie Luvu more as a pass rusher, Magee has played alongside Bobby Wagner at linebacker. Magee has flashed numerous times in 2025, as his speed is something Washington lacks on defense.\n\nWhen the Commanders selected Magee in the 2024 NFL draft, they reportedly liked him as the heir apparent to the future Hall of Famer Wagner. Unfortunately, Magee hasn't had any snaps at Mike linebacker to see if he could handle that role full-time in 2026.\n\nHead coach Dan Quinn was asked about Magee is ready for that responsibility.\n\nThe part that you want to do is like, how do you train somebody into that space?\" Quinn said this week. \"And some of it is, in practice, you have a number of them that can have it on, so they're hearing my communication. So, what we would never want is on the first time you heard it, like, 'Oh, that's what Dan sounds like, or that's what it sounds like.' And so, you go through that process in the practice. So, when he takes his reps in the practice, when if he was with the second or the third group, it's the same exact process that I would do with Wags, 'Hey, this down in distance, remind this player alert for this.' So, there's a little bit of directing that comes of it.\"\n\nWith Washington long out of contention, fans have wanted to see Magee replace Wagner. That's not the right decision. Wagner remains one of the Commanders' top defensive players, despite his struggles in coverage. The ideal scenario would be limiting his snaps. It would not only help keep Wagner fresh, but also give the staff an evaluation of how Magee handles playing inside.\n\nQuinn offered even more details on Magee playing inside.\n\n\"Think if you were a quarterback in the huddle and you want to give one more reminder before you broke out to somebody, you would tell them that that's sometimes what I'm telling that person to do into that spot and then going in, you want to find out did they do it in college and signals and now it'll be different I suppose because that's been an additional thing that they're doing that we haven't done before,\" he said. \"But just the leading part of it, I think that's the big thing, the vocal part of it. Doesn't mean you have to be loud and rah rah, but you have to be somebody that can take command, that can give information quickly. And not all linebackers can do that.\"\n\nThat's a thorough answer. Was Quinn telling us something about Magee without actually saying it? It's clear he likes him. The Commanders see Magee as a part of their future, but that doesn't necessarily mean playing inside.\n\nWagner is 35 and a free agent at season's end. With so many holes to fix on defense, don't count on the Commanders handing the position to Magee full-time in 2026 without knowing if he's ready for it. Whose fault is that?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Can Jordan Magee replace Bobby Wagner in 2026?",

    "description": "The Philadelphia 76ers discuss the defensive effort from the guards following their win over the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "The Philadelphia 76ers were able to even up their road trip at 2-2 with a 123-108 win over the Dallas Mavericks on New Year's Day. The Sixers are now in position for a 3-2 road trip if they can finish it with a win over the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.\n\nOne aspect from the win over the Mavericks that has to be pointed out is the defensive effort by Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe. While Edgecombe had the billing of being a defender entering the draft, it has been the opposite for Maxey as he has had to work hard to be a more than solid defender for Philadelphia at this stage.\n\nMaxey had two blocks and two steals against the Mavericks while Edgecombe had four steals and a rude block in the fourth quarter to seal it for Philadelphia. After the win, coach Nick Nurse revealed he and his staff have been working with both to get some pick 6 type of opportunities on the defensive end.\n\n\"Again, those guys are both lightning quick, and we're trying to work on some things where they can create some turnovers or some pick six--those are huge,\" Nurse told reporters. \"Even Q (Quentin Grimes) has such a burst into some passing lanes, and you get one or two of those a game that gives you a free layup at the other end.\"\n\nThe Sixers have to get creative with Maxey on the defensive end of the floor to make up for some limitations here and there. While credit has to go to Maxey for the constant work he has put in to become the defender he is right now, the Sixers have still needed to get creative with their backcourt pairing.\n\n\"We try to be aggressive with guys that are making spin moves and things like that,\" Nurse finished. \"You see us chasing those guys down. We get hurt by it, sometimes a little over-aggressive, but for the most part, we created some turnovers, and that turned into some easy offense.\"\n\nIf Maxey and Edgecombe continue to take steps in the defensive department of their game, then that enhances what they can do on the offensive end. The two combined for 57 points while also causing problems for Dallas on the defensive end. That's something the Sixers will hope can continue to grow as time moves on.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers discuss defensive effort from guards after win over Mavericks",

    "fullText": "Lazio are already moving to reshape their attack following Valentin Castellanos’ departure, with Andrea Pinamonti emerging as a leading candidate to fill the void.\n\nCastellanos’ exit has now been finalised, with the Argentine set to join West Ham United in a deal worth around €30 million including bonuses.\n\nThe striker has signed a long-term contract running until 2030, bringing an end to a spell in Rome that had become increasingly strained under Maurizio Sarri. Castellanos opted to remain in Europe and test himself in the Premier League, turning down an alternative offer from Flamengo.\n\nROME, ITALY – AUGUST 31: Valentin Castellanos of Lazio celebrates scoring his team’s third goal during the Serie A match between SS Lazio and Hellas Verona FC at Stadio Olimpico on August 31, 2025 in Rome, Italy. (Photo by Paolo Bruno/Getty Images)\n\nWith the sale essentially completed, Lazio’s focus has shifted immediately to reinforcements.\n\nSarri has made it clear that a new centre-forward is required, and according to Tuttosport, Andrea Pinamonti of Sassuolo is now one of the main profiles under consideration.\n\nThe trail leading to Giacomo Raspadori has cooled, with the Italy international now expected to head to Roma.\n\nVERONA, ITALY – OCTOBER 03: Andrea Pinamonti of Sassuolo celebrates scoring his team’s first goal during the Serie A match between Hellas Verona FC and US Sassuolo Calcio at Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi on October 03, 2025 in Verona, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\nLazio’s January plans are not limited to the No.9 role. Sarri has also requested an attacking winger, with sporting director Angelo Fabiani continuing talks for Daniel Maldini. Meanwhile, the coach’s preferred option remains Lorenzo Insigne, who has already given his approval to a short-term deal with an option through 2027 and is waiting for a call from Formello.\n\nFurther changes could follow. Nuno Tavares is edging toward an exit, with Al Ittihad his likely destination. Should that move be completed, Lazio are expected to target Alfonso Pedraza as a replacement on the left flank.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool took the decison to offload several midfield talents last summer.\n\nWe saw outgoing deals concluded for James McConnell and Harvey Elliott - who left on loan - while Tyler Morton was sold to Lyon.\n\nAnother player who was loaned out is Luca Stephenson. The 22-year-old had spent the previous campaign with Dundee United in Scotland - impressing as their young player of the year.\n\nDefying predictions that he had no future at Anfield, the young Englishman ended up signing a new contract last summer and was also brought into the side for preseason.\n\nStephenson then concluded another loan move to Dundee United - where has once again been excellent. Indeed with Elliott, McConnell and others struggling, there is little doubt that Stephenson is the best Liverpool performer out on loan this term.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nHis form has led to speculation that Liverpool may well seek to cash in next summer. A new report in the Athletic now claims that several Championship clubs are sniffing around Stephenson with a view to concluding a deal in 2026.\n\n“Stephenson is Liverpool’s best-performing loan player and is growing in value during a second season in Scotland,” the report reads.\n\n“Liverpool extended the 22-year-old right-back’s contract by a further 12 months before he rejoined Dundee United and he’s transformed from the young player of the season to the best player of the season so far.\n\n“Stephenson is expected to see out the campaign at Tannadice but is attracting interest from Championship clubs and is expected to leave Liverpool on a permanent deal in the summer.”\n\nStephenson signed for the Reds’ academy from Sunderland back in 2018 - inking a first professional deal back in 2020. This season he has been in very good form for the Tangerines - giving Liverpool a chance to receive a cash boost for his services next summer.",

    "fullText": "Everton will host Brentford at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Sunday for their first match of the new year.\n\nThe Toffees ended 2025 eighth in the league standings with a 2-0 victory over Nottingham Forest away from home. The game at City Ground was a real test of the Blues’ squad depth, who were missing several key players and hadn’t won or scored a goal in the preceding three matches.\n\nHowever, the likes of James Garner, James Tarkowski, Jake O’Brien and Tim Iroegbunam stepped up to secure an impressive win and ensure the side’s return to the top half of the table.\n\nFollowing a run of difficult games against Chelsea and Arsenal, the Blues will aim to build momentum with home games against Brentford and bottom-placed Wolves in their pursuit of European football.\n\nEverton are unbeaten in their last six meetings with Brentford, but having lost their first league game in seven of the last eight calendar years, they cannot take a positive result for granted.\n\nBrentford are just below David Moyes’ side in the league table and registered a goalless draw with Tottenham Hotspur on New Year’s Day. The Bees have not faced defeat in their last four matches; however, their form on the road remains poor. Only Wolves have lost more top-flight away games than Brentford’s seven losses on the road this season.\n\nKeith Andrews’ side have a more productive attack than the Toffees, spearheaded by Igor Thiago, who has scored 11 league goals this season. However, their backline is not as solid, and have conceded 26 goals so far, with only Manchester United having a poorer defensive record of any team in the top half of the table.\n\nThe Bees have also failed to score a goal in each of their last three away assignments against the Toffees.\n\nEverton have recalled Harrison Armstrong from his loan spell at Preston North End. The teenage midfielder is expected to provide some respite to a desperate injury crisis plaguing the squad at the moment.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Seamus Coleman remain sidelined with long-term hamstring injuries, while Michael Keane and Charly Alcaraz are also doubtful for this clash, after failing to make the squad for the trip to City Ground.\n\nDavid Moyes, however, refused to elaborate on the severity of their injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, Idrissa Gana Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye are with the Senegal national team and will face Sudan in the round of 16 of the Africa Cup of Nations this weekend.\n\nNathan Patterson made his first start for the Blues this season against Nottingham Forest and could retain his place in the XI if Keane is ruled out for the weekend. Jack Grealish is likely available to start after coming off the bench against Forest following a spell of illness that caused him to miss the goalless draw with Burnley.\n\nEverton’s predicted starting XI: Jordan Pickford (GK), Nathan Patterson, James Tarkowski, Jake O’Brien, Vitalii Mykolenko, Tim Iroegbunam, James Garner, Dwight McNeil, Tyler Dibling, Thierno Barry, Jack Grealish\n\nEverton will host Brentford at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Sunday, January 4. Kick-off for the first game of 2026 is scheduled at 3:00 pm UK time.\n\nThe Premier League contest between Everton and Brentford will be telecast on Sky Sports for viewers in the UK. Meanwhile, the game will also be available for live streaming on Sky Go and on the Sky Sports app.",

Marcelo Mayer can slot in at second or third, making either player a fit for the lineup. Bichette’s future may be tied directly to what happens with Bregman, as the Blue Jays and Red Sox are in on both players. Toronto – the only club that won’t have to give up Draft picks to sign Bichette – could bring him back for second base, where he played during the World Series, shifting Andrés Giménez to shortstop.\"\n\nMORE: Team USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nIt'd be fascinating if these teams ended up just swapping star infielders.\n\nThey could also end up each retaining their own guy.\n\nThe real bummer for one side will be if one of the Red Sox or Blue Jays gets the guy they want, but then the other one departs outside the AL East. That could shift the balance of power in the division in a big way.\n\nFor now, baseball waits to see what Bregman and Bichette do.\n\nThe Red Sox may be the fulcrum that decides what both guys end up choosing.\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nReds have a promising prospect named Ichiro Cano\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nHow Aroldis Chapman is able to pitch for Great Britain in the WBC\n\nAlex Bregman has a key free agent preference\n\nYankees' pitcher leaving MLB to sign in Japan",

    "fullText": "2026 is set to be a complete success! This motto sums up all New Year's resolutions. However, the following five football stars, for whom 2025 was not a good year, likely share this wish.\n\nThe German number one had no luck at first and then real misfortune over the past twelve months. The native of Gladbach had to endure a grueling rehab until April due to a severe patellar tendon injury. At the same time, rumors intensified that Barça was planning to move forward without their current captain from the coming summer.\n\n📸 Alex Caparros - 2025 Getty Images\n\nAnd so it happened. Joan Garcia was signed from Espanyol and declared the first-choice keeper. To make matters worse, ter Stegen had to vacate his position without a fight because recurring back problems necessitated another surgery. For the World Cup starting spot, national coach Julian Nagelsmann set a clear condition for the recovering player: regular playing time at the highest possible level. Ter Stegen aims to gather this during his loan at Girona until summer, to then fly to North America with momentum.\n\nFor Marc-André ter Stegen's long-time teammate, nothing was working lately. However, it wasn't his body that was failing, like with the German keeper, but his mind. Hansi Flick revealed, after a failed Champions League performance at the end of November, that his protégé was experiencing mental health issues.\n\n📸 ADRIAN DENNIS - AFP or licensors\n\nHis employer, FC Barcelona, reacted immediately and granted the defender indefinite leave in the middle of the season. On travels and surrounded by friends and family, Araujo apparently quickly recharged his mental batteries. Because shortly before the turn of the year, Barça's vice-captain returned to training. Hopefully, he can play more freely again in 2026.\n\nDuring the Club World Cup last summer, the Munich-based player suffered a fibula fracture that was painful to watch. A months-long break followed, but just in time for the start of the World Cup year, the comeback of the gifted dribbler is within reach.\n\n\"This will be a positive story for us in 2026. For now, it was great for his feeling, and from next year we can expect a lot from Jamal,\" promised Bayern coach Vincent Kompany in a media round before the turn of the year. Musiala himself will surely wish for this too!\n\nYep, he's still around. The Brazilian maestro is currently sidelined by an injury, but his situation is far more precarious than Musiala's. So why is he still listed here? Because despite the worst prospects, the Brazilian is firmly convinced that he will make a breakthrough in the new year.\n\n📸 MIGUEL SCHINCARIOL - AFP or licensors\n\nThe 33-year-old underwent knee surgery again in December, and whether he will be fit in time for the World Cup is highly questionable. And even if he is: due to ongoing injury problems, his last international match dates back to October 2023. Nevertheless, he announced something big on 'X': \"If we reach the [World Cup] final... I promise I will score a goal.\" We are intrigued!\n\nThe City debut season of the former Frankfurt player was actually decent. Marmoush managed nine scorer points in 16 Premier League appearances. However, a crucial missed shot cast a dark shadow. In the FA Cup final, the Egyptian missed a penalty, leading to Crystal Palace's 1-0 victory.\n\nWhether Marmoush fell out of favor with Pep Guardiola because of this is not documented. The fact is, the 26-year-old has so far mostly only had short appearances this season and remains without a personal goal at the club level. In the new year, things can almost only get better, perhaps directly with a title win at the Africa Cup?\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Keybindings, popup tools, and workflows for a terminal-centric setup",
    "fullText": "Keybindings, popup tools, and workflows for a terminal-centric setup\n\nI have been using tmux for a long time, and it's become essential to my\nterminal-centric workflow. For many, tmux is merely a screen replacement to be\nused on remote servers, but for me it's closer to a tiling window manager for\nthe terminal. Briefly, what I think makes tmux so useful:\n\nI work on many projects at a time, and recently, with many AI agents at a\ntime. tmux allows isolating each project inside its own session, and within\na project, each task or branch in its own window. Switching between them is\na keypress away.\n\nIt's programmable. It can be scripted and extended to fit one's workflow. For\nexample, I have a tool that allows opening recent directories (based on\nzoxide) into a new tmux session with sensible window layout based on the\nproject.\n\nIt's composable. One of my favorite tmux features is display-popup, which\nopens a floating terminal that can run anything. Combine it with fzf and you\nhave a file picker. Small tools are wired together into\nsomething IDE-like.\n\nNow, let me walk through the setup. I'll try to cover the most relevant parts.\nInstallation instructions for tmux can be found\nelsewhere.\n\nJust briefly about terminal choice. tmux itself is fairly terminal-agnostic, but\nsome keybindings I prefer require terminal-level configuration.\n\nI currently use Alacritty. It's GPU-accelerated and fast, though most terminal\nemulators are these days. I used iTerm2 for the longest time, but switched a few\nyears ago. Main advantage of Alacritty over iTerm2 is being able to configure\nevery aspect through a single TOML file, which is auto-reloaded automatically as\nyou make changes. This makes it easy to version control and to make changes with\nAI tools. Good luck asking an AI agent to add the Cmd+1-9\nmapping covered below through iTerm2's GUI settings.\n\nI also like that Alacritty can run without any window chrome, giving a\nminimalistic fullscreen terminal.\n\nThe first thing most people change is the prefix key. The prefix key is\nbasically how you tell tmux \"the next key is a tmux command, not input for the\nterminal.\" The default C-b is hard to reach. For reasons I can't\nremember anymore, I've landed on C-f.\n\nA few other basic settings I consider essential:\n\nThe escape-time 0 is critical if you use (neo)vim. Without it, there's a\nnoticeable delay when pressing Escape. The detach-on-destroy off\nmeans that when a session is closed, tmux switches to another session instead of\ndetaching. In practice, I rarely close sessions though.\n\nMouse mode can be useful, but it has drawbacks, so I've gotten used to working\nwithout it.\n\nFor terminal capabilities, I have true color and undercurl support (the wavy\nunderlines neovim uses for diagnostics):\n\nI've configured splits to resemble vim:\n\nIn vim, :split creates a horizontal division (panes stacked vertically), and\n:vsplit creates a vertical division. With these bindings, prefix\ns and prefix v behave like their vim\ncounterparts C-w s and C-w v.\n\nThe -c \"#{pane_current_path}\" ensures new panes start in the same directory. I\nuse the same for new windows:\n\nFor resizing, I use characters that visually suggest the direction:\n\nOne of the most useful built-in bindings is prefix z,\nwhich zooms the current pane to fill the entire window. Press it again to\nrestore the layout. Great when you need to focus on one pane temporarily.\n\nI also bind global keys (no prefix needed) to reorder windows with\nCtrl+Shift+←/→. The -d flag keeps\nfocus on the moved window.\n\nI also use Cmd+1-9 for switching windows, similarly to\nbrowser tabs. This is not a tmux setting; it's an Alacritty keybinding that\nsends the prefix followed by the window number:\n\nThe \\u0006 is the ASCII code for Ctrl+F (my prefix). So\nCmd+3 sends C-f 3, which tmux\ninterprets as \"switch to window 3\".\n\nSimilarly, Cmd+h/j/k/l\nswitches panes. The Alacritty binding sends prefix + arrow key:\n\nWhen working with multiple panes, it helps to see at a glance which one is\nactive. I use slightly different background colors:\n\nThe difference between #101010 and #151515 is subtle. Inactive panes are\njust a bit darker. The active pane also gets a green border. It's enough to\nnotice without being too distracting.\n\nMy status bar style is fairly pedestrian compared to others I've seen. I care\nmost that it's clear which window is active.\n\ntmux has a copy mode (prefix [) with vi-style navigation.\nI use it when I need to scroll back through history, but for copying visible\ntext I find it's easier to copy with the terminal's rectangular selection.\n\nRegular selection would span the entire terminal width, grabbing text from\nadjacent panes. Rectangular selection lets me draw a box around exactly the text\nI want from a single pane. In Alacritty, holding\nCtrl+Shift while selecting enables this. Most terminals\nhave a similar option. The downside is it doesn't work well with wrapped text.\n\nWith mouse mode enabled, the copying experience is probably better.\n\nI'm also working on an experimental tool, tmux-snaglord, that makes copying\nprogram output easier.\n\nThis is where things get a bit more interesting. As mentioned, tmux's\ndisplay-popup command opens a floating terminal window that can run any\ncommand. When the command exits, the popup closes. Combined with for example\nfzf, this pattern is incredibly powerful.\n\ntmux-session-switcher opens an fzf interface listing all sessions. I can type\nto filter, and selecting one switches to it. Since sessions are sorted by\nrecency, hitting C-j Enter without typing anything\nswitches to the previous session.\n\nAn alternative to this is the built-in choose-session command.\n\nI use zoxide to track the directories I visit so that I can easily cd into\nthem. This binding shows a fzf list of recent directories, and selecting one\nopens it in a new tmux window, with the name of the directory as the name of the\nwindow. Occasionally useful.\n\nI wrote about tmux-file-picker in a separate post. It's an fzf-based file\npicker that inserts the selected path into the active pane. An absolute\nmust-have when working with Claude Code or other AI coding TUI programs.\n\nI generally keep a tmux session for each project. Switching between them is\ninstant, and each session preserves its own editor state, dev servers, and shell\nsessions. To start a new session, I use tmux-bro:\n\nIt shows an fzf list of recent directories (via zoxide), and selecting one\ncreates a new session (or switches to it if one already exists).\n\nWith the emergence of AI coding tools, it's become practical to have multiple\nagents working on different tasks at the same time. One might be adding a\nfeature while another fixes a bug.\n\nThe problem is that when they share the same directory, they step on each\nother's changes - broken builds, type errors from half-finished work, and diffs\nthat mix unrelated changes.\n\nThe solution is git worktrees, which provide separate working directories for\neach task. I use workmux to pair them with tmux windows: it creates a worktree\nand opens it in a new window. This pairing of one window per task feels very\nnatural. I can switch between windows to check on agents, review their changes,\nor provide feedback.\n\nWhen a task is done, I merge the branch, delete the worktree, and close the\nwindow. I wrote more about it in\na separate post.\n\nTPM handles plugin management. The only plugin I actively use is\ntmux-logging, which lets me save a pane's entire scrollback history to a file.\nIt's occasionally useful.\n\nI'll keep this post updated as my setup evolves.",

    "title": "Tupolev Tu-4",

    "fullText": "The Tupolev Tu-4 (Russian: Туполев Ту-4; NATO reporting name: Bull) is a piston-engined Soviet strategic bomber that served the Soviet Air Force from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s. The aircraft was a copy of the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress, having been reverse-engineered from seized aircraft that had made emergency landings in the USSR.\n\nToward the end of World War II, the Soviet Union saw the need for a strategic bombing capability similar to that of the Western Allies. The Soviet VVS air arm had the locally designed Petlyakov Pe-8 four-engined \"heavy\" in service at the start of the war, but besides suffering complicated engines only 93 had been built by the end of the war and the type had become obsolete. The U.S. regularly conducted bombing raids on Japan from distant Pacific forward bases using B-29 Superfortresses. Joseph Stalin ordered the development of a comparable bomber.\n\nThe U.S. twice refused to supply the Soviet Union with B-29s under Lend Lease.[1][2] However, on four occasions during 1944, individual B-29s made emergency landings in Soviet territory and one crashed after the crew bailed out.[3] In accordance with the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, the Soviets were neutral in the Pacific War and so the bombers were interned and kept by the Soviets. Despite Soviet neutrality, the U.S. demanded the return of the bombers, but were refused.[4] Three repairable B-29s were flown to Moscow and delivered to the Tupolev OKB. One B-29 was dismantled, the second was used for flight tests and training, and the third was left as a standard for cross-reference.[5] The aircraft included one Boeing-Wichita –5-BW, two Boeing-Wichita –15-BWs and the wreckage of one Boeing-Renton –1-BN, comprising three different models from two different production lines, at Wichita and Renton. Only one of the four had deicing boots, as would be used on the Tu-4.[6] The fourth B-29 was returned to the US along with its crew with the end of the Soviet-Japanese peace. The Soviets declared war on Japan two days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, in accordance with the Yalta Agreement.[7]\n\nStalin told Tupolev to duplicate the Superfortress in as short a time as possible instead of continuing with his own comparable ANT-64/Tu-10.[8] The reverse-engineering effort involved 900 factories and research institutes, which finished the design work during the first year, and 105,000 drawings were made.[9] By the end of the second year, the Soviet industry was to produce twenty copies of the aircraft, ready for state acceptance trials.[10]\n\nThe Soviet Union used the metric system and so sheet aluminium in thicknesses matching the B-29's U.S. customary measurements was unavailable. The corresponding metric-gauge metal was of different thicknesses. Alloys and other materials new to the Soviet Union had to be brought into production. Extensive re-engineering had to take place to compensate for the differences, and Soviet official strength margins had to be decreased to avoid further redesign.[11] Despite those challenges, the prototype Tu-4 weighed only 340 kg (750 lb) more than the B-29, a difference of less than 1%.[12]\n\nThe engineers and suppliers of components were under pressure from Tupolev, Stalin, and the government to create an exact clone of the original B-29 to facilitate production. Tupolev had to overcome substantial resistance to use equipment that was not only already in production but also sometimes superior to that found on the B-29s.[13] Each alteration and every component made was scrutinized and was subject to a lengthy bureaucratic decision process. Kerber, then Tupolev's deputy, recalled in his memoirs that engineers needed authorization from a high-ranking general to use Soviet-made parachutes.[5] Differences were limited to the aforementioned sheet-metal gauges, the engines, the defensive weapons, the radio (a later model used in lend-lease B-25s was used in place of the radio in the interned B-29s) and the identification friend or foe (IFF) system since the American IFF was obviously unsuitable.[14] \nThe Soviet Shvetsov ASh-73 engine was a development of the Wright R-1820 but was not otherwise related to the B-29's Wright R-3350.[15] The ASh-73 also powered some of Aeroflot's remaining obsolescent Petlyakov Pe-8 airframes, a much-earlier Soviet four-engined heavy bomber, whose production was curtailed by higher-priority programs. The B-29's remote-controlled gun turrets were redesigned to accommodate the Soviet Nudelman NS-23, a harder-hitting and longer-ranged 23 mm (0.91 in) cannon.[16] Additional changes were made as a result of problems encountered during testing related to engine and propeller failures,[17] and equipment changes were made throughout the aircraft's service life.[18]\n\nThe Tu-4 first flew on 19 May 1947 and was flown by test pilot Nikolai Rybko.[19] Serial production started immediately, and the type would enter large-scale service by 1949. The aircraft was first displayed during a flyover on 3 August 1947 at the Tushino Aviation Day parade. At first three aircraft flew over and the Western observers assumed that they were merely the three B-29 bombers which they knew had been diverted to the Soviet Union during World War II. Minutes later a fourth aircraft appeared, and the observers realized the Soviets had reverse-engineered the B-29.[20]\n\nEntry into service of the Tu-4 threw the U.S. Air Force into panic since the aircraft possessed sufficient range to attack Chicago or Los Angeles on a one-way mission, and that may have informed the maneuvers and air combat practice conducted by US and British air forces in 1948 involving fleets of B-29s.[21] \nThe tests were conducted by the RAF Central Fighter Establishment and co-operative US B-29 groups and involved demonstration of recommended methods of attack against B-29/Tu 4-type bombers using RAF Gloster Meteor and de Havilland Vampire jet fighters. The Soviets developed four different midair refueling systems to extend the bomber's range, but these were fitted to only a few aircraft, and only a small number of the final design were installed on operational aircraft before the Tu-4 was superseded by the Tu-16.[22]\n\nA total of 847 Tu-4s had been built when production ended in the Soviet Union in 1952, some of which went to China during the later 1950s. Many experimental variants were built and the experience launched the Soviet strategic bomber program. Tu-4s were withdrawn from Soviet service in the 1960s, being replaced by more advanced aircraft including the Tupolev Tu-16 jet bomber (starting in 1954) and the Tupolev Tu-95 turboprop bomber (starting in 1956). By the beginning of the 1960s, the only Tu-4s still operated by the Soviets were used for transport or airborne laboratory purposes. A Tu-4A was the first Soviet aircraft to drop a nuclear weapon, the RDS-3.[23]\n\nThe Soviet Air Force operated 847 Tupolev Tu-4 bombers between 1948 and early 1960,[41] initially as long-range bombers. The first regiment to be re-equipped on the Tu-4 was the 185th Guards Aviation Regiment of the 13th Guards Bomber Aviation Division, stationed at Poltava Air Base in the Ukrainian SSR. The training of personnel was carried out in Kazan, at the 890th long-range bomber regiment, turned into a training unit.[42] The pilots of the 890th Regiment had extensive experience flying American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated B-24 Liberator aircraft.[43] In March 1949 the 52nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment [ru] received Tu-4s;[44] the 121st Guards received Tu-4Rs in 1953.[45]\n\nIn 1954 the Soviets began phasing out the Tu-4 as Tupolev Tu-16 bombers entered service and, beginning in 1956, to Tupolev Tu-95 bombers. Tu-4s withdrawn from front line units were used for transport duties.[46]\n\nOn 28 February 1953, Joseph Stalin gave China ten Tu-4 heavy bombers, and in 1960 two additional aircraft configured as navigational trainers arrived in Beijing. 11 Tu-4s were refitted with AI-20K turboprop engines between 1970 and 1973. The last PLAAF Tu-4 was retired in 1988.\n\nIn 1969, China developed its first airborne early warning aircraft based on the Tu-4 airframe. The project was named KJ-1 and mounted a Type 843 rotodome above the fuselage of the aircraft. However, due to clutter noise the KJ-1 failed to meet the PLAAF's requirements. The project was canceled in 1979 although further projects were proposed based on Tu-4 platform.[47] The airframe was already obsolete however and the Tu-4 was ruled out for future developments. The single prototype is displayed at the PLAAF museum north of Beijing.\n\nData from Tupolev Tu-4 Soviet Superfortress.[52]\n\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era",

    "fullText": "Every end of the year, I sit down to do some personal reviews, as well as collect my notes. Since I have hundreds of meetings with founders and tech leaders worldwide every year, looking at it all from a higher altitude helps me notice themes and trends. This year, I decided to share those that I think are widely relevant. Yes, a good chunk are AI-related, but not all!\n\nTo be frank, CTOs were always a double-edged sword. They could dramatically accelerate things, or become a gigantic anchor. Yet 2025 was the year when I had heard a record number of startup founders lament not understanding what the F&%$ their CTO was up to. They hired people they thought were stars, only to quickly realize they were just really good at interviewing.\n\nOr, they were pleased with their tech team and were almost paralyzed from the fear of offending the senior tech leaders, knowing it could easily impact months of the roadmap if these people were to leave (or worse, “quiet quit”).\n\nEspecially true when the engineering executives aren’t cofounders, CEOs often feel like they cannot risk being 100% candid, which affects the whole company. As a coach, this is something I naturally notice and help clients fix, but for so many, there’s the impression that this is just the way “things ought to be.” Nope.\n\nRelatedly, when CTOs know how to communicate well and collaborate with their peers in the executive team, the world is their oyster. This was true in previous years, but one of the positive benefits of GenAI is that it has made virtually everyone in tech more open to changes, experimentation, and adopting new and experimental approaches.\n\nThat in turn makes it much easier for good CTOs to find growth opportunities and add value all over the company. Whereas previously this would translate into political battles, most executives are now looking for these collaborations. That makes the life of a good CTO that much easier. Reach out and seize the opportunity!\n\nBecause things are changing tremendously, a lot of what we have learned to rely on might no longer be relevant. That’s hard, because senior leaders usually get to that position precisely due to their gaining experience and wielding it. Now, some of that experience might actually hold them back.\n\nIt was never the case that we could say we have nothing more to learn. But now, it feels almost ridiculous. That means that everyone, not just ICs, ought to be investing regular time in reviewing what is working out. Experimenting all over again. I cannot stress enough how important it is to don a beginner’s mind all over again. While not all of your experience should be tossed aside, a good chunk deserves reviewing. Get curious.\n\nThere’s a reason I released the Impact Coaching Framework ebook at the start of the year (available for free here). Speaking to many leaders around the time, it was a glaring gap in many a CTO’s toolbox.\n\nWhereas many senior leaders have started working with coaches, which is a good thing, it seems that the change is also making them think that one is either a coach or not. That’s not so. You can and should coach your team. Only by doing that will you get better and will your team continue growing.\n\nPersonally, I oppose the notion of external coaches taking the responsibility of coaching from the managers in the organization. Senior leaders working with a coach should be used to help them bring coaching into their organization, not abdicate on it. So even if you bring an external expert for group coaching, for example, that doesn’t mean those people should not have effective one-on-ones with their managers.\n\nThe previous point is perhaps a specific example of this wider issue. We allow ourselves to drift as leaders, not forming a coherent “playbook” that we believe in. Whereas playbooks have been one of the core questions for interviewing senior leaders (asking them to explain their general theory for their role and how they manage it), the responses seem to be getting vaguer and vaguer every month.\n\nWake up. Take the time to decide what sort of leader you want to be. Consider what your responsibility is. Where you will be driving impact. What indicators will you focus on to assert your progress. Without doing those, you’re not actually taking the lead.\n\nAs someone who used to walk around with a clean code armband, I find this extremely awkward. The GenAI changes to the landscape of software development make it so that people aren’t focusing on how the code looks anymore. Crafting code is no longer worth the time, it seems. At least not during writing (when we end up needing to debug the code, sometimes even the machine can’t explain well what it had in mind, and clean code shines).\n\nWhat I see taking its place is clean architecture. Engineers are shifting more and more to giving higher resolution directions to their agents and not stressing too much about the code itself as long as it seems to work.\n\nOne of my most popular articles ever is about having fewer principal engineers and more product engineers. That was about engineers who focus on the product itself, understanding the business and the users’ needs. A few years have passed, and this has doubled in importance.\n\nHowever, product engineers now are different. Given that teams can move much faster, I see many lament that product managers cannot keep up. While I assume the industry will continue to come up with ways to aid them, too, I think the engineers ought to step up. They can be involved in many of these decisions and experiments and help their product counterparts work on the areas that are most critical or highest leverage.\n\nWhere people are relying more on agents for their day-to-day coding, these tools have glaring holes in areas that they weren’t trained enough on. I’m seeing teams realizing that their moats and advantages get deeper in those areas without them having to do anything.\n\nHowever, the other side of the coin is that these areas are also harder to hire for. Personally, I think that software engineers who choose a niche can set themselves up for a very interesting career that will be more “AI-proof” than others.\n\nIt also means that those who create abstractions and frameworks are getting rarer. Like people are questioning whether React will be the “last web framework” because now humans will no longer write code by hand, I think that those who are still coming up with new paradigms and concepts to manage software are going to be rare but priceless. GitHub will be filled with stupid projects, making the actually good ones more valuable.\n\nRelated to the over-reliance on experience, I’m seeing some junior engineers adopting AI tools much more naturally than some senior ones. Perhaps it’s because they aren’t already too set in their ways to change course faster.\n\nThis is particularly interesting given the earlier lamentations that expected LLMs to make juniors obsolete. That’s far from the truth, at least for those relentless juniors who are curious, hungry, and seeking to learn things fast.\n\nOne of my clients this year went over the course of a few months from barely any AI adoption to getting so much out of it that it has completely transformed their product roadmap. They essentially pivoted without formally saying so. The interesting part is that this was the result of a combined effort, both top-down but also bottom-up.\n\nWhile the CEO knew that something would have to change, it was only after we worked on the team’s AI literacy and started running experiments that it was possible to find these areas to double down on. That’s what I’m seeing in general with AI: cycles where teams experiment with a specific tool, approach, or process and, if they find it valuable, exploit it by systemizing the thing. Don’t assume you can have a single AI hackathon and be set.\n\nWishing you a happy and remarkable 2026! And if you want someone to help ensure you grow faster, reach out.",

    "fullText": "- \nWhy I switched away from Zig to C3\n\n- \nDefining & Implementing an interface\n\n- \nReferring to an Interface by Pointer\n\n- \nOptionals are not really Optionals?\n\n- \nWhat about the Scheme-like dialect?\n\nFew years ago, I have discovered a programming language called\nZig, as a C programmer it\nhas given me the opportunity to write reliable, fast code while being more \nproductive. \"Why not Rust?\" you may ask. Well, I don't like Rust that \nmuch, that said I won't dislike you for using it! Zig was giving me \njoy, not to mention the better cross-compilation\nit offered, but there was something missing, something off. \nIgnoring all the issues, high verbosity (e.g. when casting)\nand breaking changes present in every new Zig release; it was C syntax, I simply kept \nreturning to writing C because it was simple and intuitive for my brain to write...\n\nAnd then something happened... Tsoding\nmade a stream about C3 \n(VOD).\nAt the time I was a Zig & C fanboy. C3 didn't click with me at first, having the\nneed to use fn was a bit strange to me, or the enforced code style: \ne.g. PascalCase for types, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants, etc...\n\nSpoiler alert: I changed my mind!\n\nAt the time I was working on a project called\nsc, my own \nchallenge to make a small \nScheme-like \ndialect in less than 1000 lines, I was mostly successful, however it had \nUB. Later, I thought about giving C3 a try,\nwhy wait till it gets better? I'll use it now, possibly contribute and learn something \nnew! And maybe make a new Scheme-like dialect, but not as a challenge.\nSo I joined C3's discord server...\n\nFirst steps were rough, especially getting familiar with the language. It looks\nlike better C, but it was a whole new experience for me! I had to look at the \ndocumentation a lot \n(which is apparently dated!) and read the \nsource code \nof the standard library, which went quite okay considering I learned that \nability from Zig!\n\nDuring the familiarization stage of the language, I got a lot \nof help from\nChristoffer Lerno himself.\nI have learned about the @pool temporary allocator, when to use\nmethods and bunch more cool things I get to enjoy about the language.\n\nNow I'm going to list feature I like about the language with \nfurther detail.\n\nIn C3, you can simplify the memory management of temporary allocations \nusing the @pool temporary allocator macro. This macro makes memory \nmanagement more convenient as you don't have to manually manage the temporary \nallocated memory. Yes, you can do this in C, Zig, etc just fine by using an\nArena Allocator.\nHowever you also need to initialize/free the arena, costing you few extra lines.\n\nCode sample:\n\nIn the standard library functions/methods that require an\nAllocator use the prefix \"t\" to symbolize the usage\nof the temporary allocator. If a such function/method were missing, you can provide \nthe temporary allocator using the global variable \"tmem\". (For a normal\n(libc) allocator you can use the global \"mem\" instead)\n\nIn Zig a file counts as a module, you cannot freely split it across files.\nWell, yes you can, but you'll just end up nesting them. C3 modules feel kinda like\nC++ namespaces - a module can be extended and split across many files, heck\nyou can define multiple modules in a single source file! Isn't that convenient?\n\nTo declare a module, you can use the module statement, e.g. \nmodule foo;\n Nesting of modules is also supported with the \n:: separator, e.g. module foo::bar::baz;.\n\nTo import a module, you can use the import statement, e.g.\nimport std::collections::list. Imports are always recursive, meaning sub-modules\nget imported as well:\n\nWhat about types?\n\nTypes in modules are usually imported into the global scope, which can cause issues\nsuch as duplicate types. To prevent these issues, you can use the module path when\nresolving the type:\n\nModule names in C3 are limited only to lowercase characters + underscore \nand each module name can be up to 31 characters long.\n\nUnlike Zig, C3 allows you to define macros/methods on types from multiple \nfiles/modules & implement interface methods using the @dynamic attribute.\n\nMethods look exactly like functions, but are prefixed with the type name \nand is invoked using dot syntax:\n\nC3 offers a bit more features to functions/methods, to which I'll get to later.\n\nInterfaces my beloved! Yes yes, Zig has tagged unions for this, but\nthose are less flexible than interfaces in general. Interfaces in C3 work in similar\nway any type does, think of any as typed \nvoid *.\n\nAn interface can be defined like so:\n\nTo declare a type that implements an interface, add it after the type name:\n\nThis way if type Baz didn't implement the method \n\"myname\" it would count as compile time error.\n\nInterfaces can also be implemented on already existing types, you just won't \nget the benefits of compile time checks.\n\nA method must be declared with the @dynamic attribute\nwhen implementing a method of an interface.\n\nAn interface, e.g. MyName, can be cast back and forth to \nany, but only types which implement the interface completely may \nimplicitly be cast to the interface:\n\nThere isn't a big difference between dynamic and normal methods,\nyou can call them directly like a normal function too! They just offer the \nbenefit of being callable from an interface:\n\nContracts are optional pre- and post-condition checks that the compiler\ncan use for runtime checks, optimizations, etc. Be aware the compiler may \noptimize some away, ensure you are using safe mode of the compiler so they are \nchecked during runtime.\n\nCode sample:\n\nYou can read more about contracts\nhere.\n\nI'm starting to realize that listing all the features would make the blog post exponentially \nlonger, it's quite long already! This isn't the C3 documentation %@#* it!\n\nI'll just list the features I'd like to mention and provide you with a link\nto the documentation page so you can read them during your spare time:\n\nJust like all the good things, C3 isn't all sunshine and rainbows, and \nthat's okay, not everyone likes the same things, has same thoughts and so on.\n\nHere is a list of things I find odd and don't like about C3:\n\nC3 does have enums, they were re-worked from the ground\nup. Don't get me wrong, they are indeed quite powerful, but by default they don't \nshare the same behavior to C enums. To achieve such behavior, you'll have to \nwrite a new type of enum called a \"const enum\":\n\nThis however wasn't always the case, before we got \"const enums\" we either\nhad to rely on global constants or simply deal with the extra added abstraction.\nJust a slight warning for people who want C style enums!\n\nHere is the documentation\n page to learn more about enums.\n\nOkay, I get it, naming is hard! And yes, this is also likely my fault coming from Zig\nand a bit of Rust. I'm sure you'll understand some of my struggles when you decide to learn C3 too.\n\nCiting the documentation: \"Optionals are a safer alternative to returning -1 or \nnull from a function, when a valid value can’t be returned. An \nOptional has either a result or is empty. When an Optional is \nempty it has an Excuse explaining what happened.\"\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nERROR: Does Not Compute\n\nSegmentation Fault\n\n...\n\nHey Oxy! Can you pull up the definition of the word \"optional\" in programming context \nfor me? Thank you!\n\nSo this means an optional is either something or nothing.\nBut that's not a case in C3... it's something or something.\nThe Excuse is also kinda a value, not the state of \"nothing-ness\".\n\nRust has something similar to C3, it's called \nResult, good name Rust!\n\nIf you are just as confused as I am, that's correct! As I was implementing \nsyntax highlighting for codeblocks on my website, I thought of using io::read_fully\nfunction from io/stream.c3 which expects an object implementing the\nInStream interface. I got stdout from spawned SupProcess and passed\nit into the function, however I was faced with io::FILE_IS_PIPE fault???\n\nWhat happened? Let me show you the source code of the function:\n\nThis looks mostly fine... until you realize the function available is \nreturning size? Let's look at the available function:\n\nSigh, there it is, seeking inside a stream, NOW that's not\nreally an issue if your input stream is a file... not really a case for a pipe,\nthen let's have a look at stdout method of SubProcess:\n\nAnd would you look at that? stdout is treated as a file whether it's \nan actual file or a pipe!\n\nI have already filed an issue for this.\n\nI have worked on it and even streamed the progress of it! You can find the \nfirst stream \nhere. And if you're \ninterested in the rest of the VODs, you can find them all\nhere.\nI plan on working on it and streaming some more soon!\n\nAs I was starting to get familiar with the language, I have started \ncontributing back, whether it were issues, pull requests, projects or sharing\nthe good word.\n\nYou can find full lists of issues and pull requests here:\n\n- Issues\n\n- Pull Requests\n\nOpenPNGStudio\n- Create & stream PNGTuber models\n\nSchem\n- Scheme-like dialect written in C3\n\nNovacrash\n- A simple and configurable GUI panic handler for C3\n\nEv\n- Event loop implementation in C3\n\nlowbytefox.dev\n- This website is written in C3\n\nPatterngen\n- Generate random patterns based on seed\n\nSi18n\n- A simple, compiled internationalization library for software translations\n\nI'm slowly progressing on these projects, most are dependencies for \nOpenPNGStudio as I'm trying to rewrite the whole project from C to C3!\n\n(OpenPNGStudio was supposed to be rewritten to Zig, but I liked C3 more)\n\nZig is a solid choice for C programmers as it's more battle\ntested, has bigger and stronger community, however don't sleep on C3 either,\ngive it a chance! Things are rough now, but by using it and reporting issues\nyou contribute to the project and help it become better! C3 community may be small,\nbut we strive to help C3 grow, make it more known, fun and simple to use.\n\nSources:\n\n- C3 Documentation\n\n- Wikipedia\n\nHope you had fun time reading, until next time!",

    "description": "A common sentiment I see with folks interested in improving US homebuilding is that we should try and emulate Sweden.",
    "fullText": "Just a speculation, but I wonder how much underground parking increases Swedish multifamily construction costs. In my travels in Europe I am struck by the extent (almost universality) of underground parking, especially in colder climates. Obviously building underground parking is more expensive than just laying down some asphalt outside.\n\nI would also lean into the 'Swedish housing is higher quality' argument. Not just the outside windows & doors, but solid-core interior doors, soundproofing, structural integrity - is it my imagination or does European modern construction just feel more solid, more durable, thicker, quieter, more substantial than American?\n\nAlso, it would be interesting to compare long-term (30+ years) energy, repair & maintenance costs. My hunch is that in Sweden you pay more up front but less over time.\n\nSome friends of mine recently bought a townhouse in Sweden in one of the smaller coastal cities. The big problem they encountered was the thin market. They had a bit of a wait before something suitable became available.\n\nIt was interesting to read this article about the Swedish housing industry in comparison with the market in the US. One advantage of factory produced housing is that it is easier to manage supplies. Contractors I've employed often find out they need a particular item or tool and have to stop work for a side quest. Only the most experienced and luckiest ones have everything they need on hand. A factory site can maintain an inventory and is less likely to be an hour long drive to the nearest hardware store.",

    "description": "Scientists took samples from whale blow, identifying possible disease risks for marine mammals in northern seas.",
    "fullText": "In northern Norway, scientists detected a disease-causing virus in humpback whales by flying drones over them. It is the first time the virus, known as cetacean morbillivirus, has been identified in Arctic waters.\n\nUsing drones to collect samples from whale blow, scientists tested for four different viruses. The findings, published in mid-December in the journal BMC Veterinary Research, showed that cetacean morbillivirus, a highly infectious and deadly virus, is circulating in northern ecosystems.\n\n“It has never been reported in that area before,” said Helena Costa, a veterinarian at Nord University, who led the study. “We kind of expected that some of the species that migrate would bring it in.”\n\nCetacean morbillivirus is highly infectious in porpoises, dolphins, whales and other marine mammals. It has caused several outbreaks worldwide, particularly in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, affecting the respiratory and neurological systems and leading to mass strandings and deaths. The virus is transmitted through direct contact between marine mammals and through respiratory droplets and is not necessarily fatal; some infected animals exhibit no symptoms.\n\nDespite its prevalence elsewhere in the world, the virus had not been previously detected in the Arctic Circle. The lack of reported cases in the region may reflect gaps in surveillance rather than the true absence of the virus, the study suggested.\n\nTo determine whether the virus was traveling so far north, Dr. Costa and her colleagues used drones to collect samples of “whale blow,” the air expelled through the animal’s blowhole. Traditionally, scientists take skin biopsies, leaving a small wound on the animal, to test for different hormones, pathogens or pollutants. Drones offer a less invasive sampling method and have proven incredibly useful in studying whales.\n\n“It’s a little bit crazy that you can collect air from a whale and actually detect something,” Dr. Costa said.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2025, scientists collected more than 50 blow samples from humpback, sperm and fin whales. Drones equipped with petri dishes were flown above and behind the whales’ blowholes to collect samples. Following humpback whale migration patterns, the researchers collected samples from whale groups in northern Norway, Iceland and Cape Verde off the coast of West Africa.\n\nBesides cetacean morbillivirus, scientists tested for three other pathogens: H5N1, the bird flu virus; herpesvirus; and a bacterium called brucella. Two of these, bird flu and brucella, can also infect humans. Dr. Costa and her colleagues wanted to determine whether these two pathogens were present in northern Norway, where people can swim with whales and would be at risk. Neither pathogen was found in the samples.\n\nWith more data, especially over time, researchers might begin to identify patterns of disease transmission, Dr. Costa said.\n\n“The interesting thing would be to see it in the long term,” she said. “You get the most valuable data when you have decades of research.”\n\nWhales are more difficult to study and to sample than other animals in northern ecosystems, and so they have not been as well represented in research.\n\n“This is a pioneering contribution,” said Patricia Arranz Alonso, a marine biologist at University of La Laguna in Spain who was not involved in the research. The findings represent the beginning of a global initiative to monitor pathogens in wild cetacean populations, she said, and the use of drones is a vital advance.\n\nDr. Costa, who hopes to continue studying disease risk for other whales in the region, agreed. Noninvasive methods open up “a new era of research for whales,” she said.",

The teen was reported missing after she left her Texas home on Christmas Eve and was found dead days later in a field near her house. Officials determined the young woman died by suicide. “Our beloved Camila Mendoza Olmos is now with the Good Lord.”\n\nThe woman also requested privacy for her grieving family.\n\n“We kindly ask that you please respect our pain and, most importantly, keep my cousin Rosario — Camila’s mom — and my nephew Carlos — Camila’s brother — in your prayers during this incredibly difficult time,” Nancy continued. “Thank you, and God bless you all.\"\n\nCamila was last seen leaving her home on Caspian Spring Road in San Antonio on the morning of Wednesday, Dec. 24, just before 7 a.m. local time, the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office said in an initial news alert. Video footage showed a person officials believe was Camila searching her car for something before they believe she left the residence on foot. She was thought to be carrying her car keys and possibly her driver’s license, but nothing else.\n\nThe teen’s mom, Rosario, told police that her daughter normally went for morning walks, but she grew concerned on that Christmas Eve when Camila didn’t return, officials said at the time.\n\nIn an interview with local outlet KENS, Rosario recalled that she and her daughter had been sleeping when she felt Camila get up from the bed. She told the outlet that 90 minutes later, she woke to find her daughter had vanished.\n\nHowever, the teenager's car was still parked at the family home, and she found Camila’s phone left on the bed.\n\n“I put it to charge and went out to look for her,\" she told the outlet. \"I thought I would find her like other times, walking, and we would come home together.\"\n\nFollowing Camila’s disappearance, a multi-agency search was launched that lasted for days, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar told ABC News.\n\nIt was determined that the 19-year-old died by suicide from a gunshot wound to the head, the sheriff's office said.\n\n\"From what has been described to us, it sounds like it was a young person going through a very tough time in their life, going through some emotional issues,\" Salazar said on Dec. 30, adding that while Camila had never been formally diagnosed, she did exhibit some \"signs of depression.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nSince the family — and the nation — learned of Camila’s fate, tributes and condolences have poured in.\n\n“She was so lovely. Such a joy to be around,” wrote one woman in response to Nancy’s post. “She was truly one of a kind, will be missed by everyone who got the pleasure of meeting her. May Camila Rest In Peace.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, emotional distress, substance use problems, or just needs to talk, call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org 24/7.",

    "fullText": "Russian authorities said Friday that the death toll from a Ukrainian drone strike they said struck a café in a Russian-occupied village in Ukraine’s Kherson region rose to 27 people. Kyiv denied attacking civilian targets.\n\nSvetlana Petrenko, spokeswoman of Russia's main criminal investigation agency, the Investigative Committee, said in a statement that a Ukrainian drone strike on a café and hotel in the village of Khorly, where at least 100 civilians were celebrating New Year's Eve overnight into Thursday, killed 27 people, including two minors. A total of 31, including five minors, were hospitalized with injuries.\n\nA criminal probe on the charges of carrying out an act of terrorism has been opened, Petrenko said.\n\nKyiv denied attacking civilians. Spokesman of Ukraine’s General Staff, Dmytro Lykhovii, told Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne on Thursday that Ukrainian forces “adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law” and \"carry out strikes exclusively against Russian military targets, facilities of the Russian fuel and energy sector, and other lawful targets.”\n\nLykhovii said that General Staff has published an explicit list of targets that the Ukrainian army struck on the night of New Year’s Eve. The list did not include strikes on occupied parts of the Kherson region.\n\nLykhovii noted that Russia has repeatedly used disinformation and false statements to disrupt the ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nThe Associated Press could not independently verify claims made about the attack.\n\nRussia's accusations against Ukraine come amid a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Moscow alleged that Kyiv launched a long-range drone attack against a residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in northwestern Russia overnight from Sunday to Monday.\n\nKyiv has called the allegations of an attack on Putin’s residence a ruse to derail ongoing peace negotiations, which have ramped up in recent weeks on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn his New Year’s address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a peace deal was “90% ready” but warned that the remaining 10%, believed to include key sticking points such as territory, would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live.”\n\nTrump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that he, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process.”\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, Russia conducted what local authorities called “one of the most massive” drone attacks at Zaporizhzhia overnight.\n\nAt least nine Russian drones struck the city, damaging dozens of residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure, head of the regional administration, Ivan Fedorov, wrote on Telegram on Friday. There were no casualties, the official said.\n\nOverall, Russia fired 116 long-range drones at Ukraine last night, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said that 86 drones were intercepted, while 27 more have reached their targets.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry reported Friday that its air defenses intercepted 64 Ukrainian drones overnight over multiple Russian regions.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, governor of Russia's Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine, on Friday also accused Ukrainian forces of carrying out a missile strike on the city of Belgorod. Two women were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. The strike shattered windows in multiple residential buildings and damaged an unspecified “commercial” facility and a number of cars, according to the official.",

    "fullText": "During the Covid lockdowns, my wife and I occasionally ordered from major steakhouses like Morton’s and Ruth’s Chris, which offered aggressive delivery deals and meal kits.\n\nThose promotions underscored how heavily steakhouses depended on in-person dining and how vulnerable they were when offices emptied, and business travel stalled.\n\n\"As remote or hybrid work continues to be popular, office attendance has fallen. Less in-person work may increase office vacancy rates and reduce foot traffic to other businesses located in office-dense areas,\" shared the Federal Reserve of Kansas City.\n\nBasically, if people stopped going to the office or went in less often, the businesses built to serve office workers suffered.\n\nThat has a ripple effect to related businesses like hotels and fine dining establishments catering to business dinners and travelers.\n\n\"Policy restrictions closed service establishments across the United States during the\nearly months of COVID. As cities emerged from the lockdowns of the early pandemic period some, but not all, of this business returned, and many establishments in city centers remained closed,\" The New York Fed shared in a special report on the Future of New York City.\n\nOne restaurant chain, McCormick & Schmick’s, suffered heavily from this change in work patterns, contributing to its steady decline from 60 locations at its peak to 13 now.\n\nMcCormick & Schmick's, a steak and seafood chain, was founded in Portland in 1979.\n\nIts final location in Portland closed in March, 2025.\n\n“We are grateful for our dedicated employees and the support of the Tigard community over the years,” said COO Shah Ghani in a statement reported by KPTV. “While this location is closing, we are working on relocating our team members to nearby properties and look forward to welcoming our guests at Jake’s Grill, Jake’s Crawfish, and other McCormick & Schmick’s locations nationwide.”\n\nThose brands, like McCormick & Schmick's are owned by Landry's Restaurants.\n\n“We thought it would be here forever,” said Bill Stockton, who came to get one last meal at the restaurant with his wife, Claudia, Saturday afternoon.\n\n“I think they’re irreplaceable,” said Claudia Stockton. “There’s nothing like it.”\n\nLandry's is not public and does not report sales data, but Nation's Restaurant News shared some insight as to why the chain has been struggling.\n\nTaco Bell and KFC work on simplifying their restaurants\n\nChick-fil-A making major change to 425 restaurants nationwide\n\nBankrupt beer and pizza restaurant chain closes locations\n\nRestaurant chain famed for rude waiters closes multiple locations\n\n\"Houston-based steak and seafood concept McCormick & Schmick’s lost 10.2% in sales in 2024 to $82.1 million, while closing 8.7% of its system to end the year with 21 locations. The chain, part of Landry’s Inc., once boasted more than 60 locations,\" Nation's Restaurant News reported.\n\nThose closures continued in 2025, and the chain only has 13 locations left, according to its website.\n\nSeveral McCormick & Schmick’s locations have closed this year as the upscale seafood and steakhouse chain trims its footprint under parent company Landry’s Hospitality, according to SeafoodSource.\n\nLast Oregon restaurant closed in March 2025, marking the end of the brand’s presence in its home state of Oregon, shared Eater.\n\nMcCormick & Schmick’s in Chicago’s Loop abruptly shut after its lease expired, surprising staff and diners late in 2025, reported NBC Chicago.\n\nCharlotte’s final McCormick & Schmick’s location closed in May 2025, ending more than 20 years of service in that city. k1047.com\n\n“A whole lot of these companies are finding their sales aren’t turning out to be as strong as expected,” says Jim Sanderson, a restaurant industry analyst for Northcoast Research. Customer traffic at full-service restaurants in the third quarter of 2024 was down 3% from a year ago and is 17% below the same period in 2019, according to CREST, Time reported.\n\nMcCormick & Schmick's is not the only steakhouse chain closing locations. Outback Steakhouse, owned by Bloomin' Brands, recently decided to close 41 locations.\n\n\"We periodically review our asset base and, in our latest review, we made the decision to close 41 underperforming locations. The majority of these restaurants were older assets with leases from the ‘90s and early 2000s,\" Bloomin' Brands CEO David Deno shared during the chain's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nMany American consumers have cut back on their discretionary spending, according to the latest Consumerwise State of the US Consumer report from McKinsey.\n\n\"The 'lipstick effect,' or the tendency for consumers to indulge in small luxuries or affordable treats during periods of economic uncertainty, has expanded beyond the beauty aisle. Even as 75% of consumers reported trading down in at least one category, 39% of consumers expressed their intent to splurge on a range of categories,\" according to the study.\n\nSteakhouses, however, appear to be a luxury that some people are willing to forgo.\n\n\"But perhaps most crucially, consumer attitudes toward dining have shifted dramatically. The same inflation hitting restaurants is also affecting their customers. When grocery bills and mortgage payments consume more of the monthly budget, that $75 ribeye becomes harder to justify, even for six-figure earners,\" Money Talks News reported.\n\nBankrate's 2025 Discretionary Spending Survey shows that 54% of U.S. adults say they expect to spend less on travel, dining out, or entertainment in 2025 than they did in 2024. Notably, that number is higher than the 49% in last year’s survey who expected to spend less in 2024 than they did in 2023.\n\n\"The cumulative effects of inflation and high interest rates have been straining households, contributing to record levels of credit card debt and causing consumer sentiment to plummet, Bankrate Senior Industry Analyst Ted Rossman shared.",

    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said Thursday that his government is open to negotiating an agreement with the United States after months of American military pressure targeting drug trafficking networks tied to his government.\n\nIn a pre-taped interview with Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet that aired on state television, Maduro said Venezuela is \"ready\" to discuss a drug-trafficking deal with the U.S. He called on the countries to \"start talking seriously, with data in hand.\"\n\n\"The U.S. government knows, because we’ve told many of their spokespeople, that if they want to seriously discuss an agreement to combat drug trafficking, we’re ready,\" he said. \"If they want oil, Venezuela is ready for U.S. investment, like with Chevron, whenever they want it, wherever they want it and however they want it.\"\n\nChevron Corp. is the only major U.S. oil company currently exporting Venezuelan crude to the United States.\n\nMaduro Trapped With Few Retaliation Options After Trump Admin Seizes Venezuelan Oil Tanker\n\nMaduro said the U.S. wants a regime change in Venezuela and access to its oil reserves through a monthslong pressure campaign that began with a major military deployment to the Caribbean Sea in August.\n\nHe said it is clear the U.S. wants \"to impose themselves through threats, intimidation and force.\"\n\nThe interview was recorded on New Year’s Eve, the same day the U.S. military announced a kinetic strike that killed five people aboard two vessels operated by designated terrorist organizations involved in narcotics trafficking.\n\nSen.

    "description": "As the new year dawns, it’s time to talk doomsday.",
    "fullText": "As the new year dawns, it’s time to talk doomsday, my babies — and no one grips us with grim quite like Nostradamus.\n\nMichel de Nostredame, Nostradamus, or Nos if you’re nasty, was a 16th-century astrologer, doctor, enemy of the church and bearded soothsayer who has been credited with foretelling the Great Fire of London, Hitler’s rise to power, the 9/11 attacks, the COVID-19 pandemic, the deaths of Queen Elizabeth II and Pope Francis and the powerful earthquake that rocked Japan on New Year’s Day 2024 to name a few.\n\nKnown as the “prophet of doom,” Nostradamus’ decidedly dark worldview was shaped by a steady diet of Old Testament brimstone and the trauma of losing his wife and young children to plague. Unable to cure the ones he loved most, it seems he set out to forewarn the rest of us through his revelations of ruin.\n\nSometimes right on the money but more often than not missing the mark, our man’s prophecies lean toward conflagration and catastrophe.\n\nWith the publication of his famed book “Les Prophéties” in 1555, Nostradamus gifted the world and its future generations a quasi-poetic tome that predicts wars, pestilence, natural disasters, civil unrest, political assassinations and other such lighthearted fare.\n\nHeavy on language such as “blood rain,” the book is an enduring classic, and with 2026 on the horizon, we’re looking at what fury and hellfire lie in store.\n\nIn 2025, Nostradamus predicted an end to the conflict in Ukraine, a gigantic asteroid hitting Earth, the flooding of the Amazon and the rise of an aquatic empire.\n\nWar still rages in Ukraine, and while Russian President Vladimir Putin is allegedly in the midst of planning peace with the help of the US, so far, there has been no ceasefire.\n\nIn terms of apocalyptic asteroids, NASA reports that as of December, 191 asteroids have passed dangerously close to Earth in 2025, but so far, no annihilation.\n\nIn February and March of this year, following a prolonged drought, the Ene River in the Amazon basin experienced severe rainfall and destructive flooding that devastated Indigenous Asháninka communities.\n\nWhile there has been no explicit aquatic kingdom coming for the crown, we could call the controversial rise of AI, powered by aquatic centers that use water for cooling and humidification, as an empire on the make and the egregious environmental take.\n\nNostadamus never explicitly wrote predictions for the year 2026. However, true believers in the bats–t look to quatrains numbered “26” to see what disasters lie ahead.\n\nAccording to the 26th verse of Century I, “The great man will be struck down in the day by a thunderbolt.”\n\nWe could interpret this line as the assassination of a prominent male figure or perhaps a political coup that rocks a political regime.\n\nIn the quatrain, II:26, Nostradamus writes, “Because of the favour that the city will show, the Ticino will overflow with blood.”\n\nFor the uninitiated, Ticino is an Italian-speaking region in southern Switzerland, studded with lakes and Alpine peaks.\n\nWhile the aforementioned overflow sounds grim AF, blood doesn’t necessarily mean bad news, as this prediction could reflect a potential surge in stem cell preservation.\n\nAs of 2025, umbilical cord blood stem cells from mothers giving birth in Ticino can now be preserved for private family use and for solidarity donation.\n\nIn quatrain VII: 26, Nos gets nautical, writing, “Foists and galleys around seven ships, a mortal war will be let loose.”\n\nFor the non-seafaring among us, foists are lightweight sailing ships, and galleys are ships propelled by oars. This prediction seems to reference a naval melee.\n\nExperts suspect the war in question will involve China, which has laid a controversial claim to vast expanses of ocean off its southern coast.\n\nChina, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and the Philippines have overlapping claims to these islands, reefs and waters, making for a collection of seven countries, or if you’re the poetic sort, “ships,” primed for coastal conflict.\n\nIn the quatrain I:26, our man writes: “The great swarm of bees will arise … by night the ambush …”\n\nConspiracy theorists connect the imagery of the bee to politics. In this sense, the hive mind of certain ideologies could continue to rise and rile.\n\nAs black is the preferred color of fascists and swarming insects, we can further intimate that totalitarian-leaning regimes will add to their rancid ranks in 2026.\n\nAstrologer Reda Wigle researches and irreverently reports back on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign.

    "description": "New York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, tackles the housing crisis on day one with executive orders targeting landlords and bankruptcy case intervention.",
    "fullText": "Sworn in at midnight and again hours later publicly, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani used his first day in office Thursday to hit the ground running with new executive orders targeting city landlords and housing development. And he said the city will take what he called \"precedent-setting action\" to intervene in a private landlord bankruptcy case he said was tied to 93 buildings.\n\n\"Today is the start of a new era for New York City,\" Mamdani said. \"It is inauguration day. It is also the day that the rent is due.\"\n\nSpeaking at a Brooklyn apartment building, Mamdani framed the moves as an early test of whether city government will directly confront landlords over housing conditions and step into court cases that could determine whether tenants remain in their homes.\n\nMamdani said New Yorkers who attended his inauguration were returning to apartments where, he said, \"bad landlords do not make repairs,\" rents rise and residents deal with issues like cockroaches and a lack of heat.\n\nZohran Mamdani Will Be First Mayor To Be Sworn In On Quran During New York City Inauguration\n\nThe mayor said the new administration \"will not wait to deliver action\" and \"will stand up on behalf of the tenants of this city.\"\n\nMamdani announced three housing-related executive orders, starting with the revival of the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants, which he said will focus on resolving complaints and holding landlords accountable for hazardous conditions.\n\n\"We will make sure that 311 violations are resolved,\" Mamdani said, adding that the administration will hold \"slumlords\" accountable for \"hazardous and dangerous threats\" to tenant well-being.\n\nMamdani Taps Controversial Lawyer Who Defended Al Qaeda Terrorist For Top Role: 'Powerful Advocate'\n\nMamdani said the second executive order creates a LIFT task force, or a land-inventory effort designed to leverage city-owned land and accelerate housing development. He said the task force will review city-owned properties and identify sites suitable for housing development no later than July 1.\n\nThe third executive order creates a SPEED task force, which Mamdani said stands for Streamlining Procedures to Expedite Equitable Development. He said the task force will work to remove permitting barriers that slow housing construction.\n\nBoth task forces will be overseen by Deputy Mayor for Housing and Planning Lila Joseph, he said.\n\n\"These are sweeping measures, but it is just the beginning of a comprehensive effort to champion the cause of tenants,\" Mamdani said.\n\nFlashback: Inside The Political Movement That Put A Socialist In Charge Of New York City\n\nEarlier in the day, Mamdani signed executive order No. 1, which revoked all prior mayoral executive orders under former Mayor Eric Adams issued on or after Sept. 26, 2024, unless they were specifically reissued by Mamdani's administration.\n\nMamdani signed a second executive order setting the structure of his administration, including five deputy mayors and their oversight responsibilities.\n\nThe mayor made the announcement at 85 Clarkson Ave., a rent-stabilized building he said is owned by Pinnacle Realty, which he described as a \"notorious landlord.\"\n\nMamdani said tenants in the building have dealt with issues, including roaches and a lack of heat.\n\nMamdani said the building is one of 93 properties connect to the same landlord, and the portfolio is in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nMAMDANI PICKS EDUCATOR WHO WORKED TO DISMANTLE GIFTED & TALENTED PROGRAM AS NYC SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR\n\nThe mayor said the buildings will be auctioned to a different landlord he claimed ranks No. 6 on New York City’s worst landlord list, adding the buildings collectively have more than 5,000 open hazardous violations and 14,000 complaints.\n\n\"This is an untenable situation,\" Mamdani said. \"So, today we are announcing that we will be taking action in the bankruptcy case and stepping in to represent the interests of the city and the interests of the tenants.\"\n\nMamdani said he directed his nominee for corporation counsel, Steve Banks, to take what he called \"precedent-setting action\" in the case.\n\n\"We are a creditor and interested party,\" Mamdani said, adding that the city is owed money and will fight for \"safe and habitable homes\" while working to \"mitigate the significant risk of displacement\" that tenants face.\n\nA tenant speaker at the event described unsafe conditions in Pinnacle buildings and said a section of hardwood floor in the speaker’s mother’s apartment had remained unrepaired for seven years.\n\n\"When they filed for bankruptcy this spring, Pinnacle gambled on making our housing less affordable and our lives more miserable,\" the speaker said.\n\nThe mayor said the moves mark the start of a more aggressive use of executive power on housing issues, beginning on his first day in office.\n\nMamdani's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "DIMONA, Israel (AP) — During the two years he was held captive in Gaza, Segev Kalfon had a recurring dream: slowly walking through a supermarket, browsing each aisle for his favorite foods, taking in the brightly colored packages and smells.\n\nSince being released on Oct. 13, his dreams have flipped: Most nights when he closes his eyes, he is back on a dirty piece of foam mattress in the 2-square-meter (22-square-foot) room in a Hamas tunnel where he was kept with five other hostages, counting each tile and crack in the cement to distract himself from severe hunger and near-daily physical torture.\n\n“I was in the lowest place a person can be before death, the lowest. I had no control over anything, when to eat, when to shower, how much I want to eat,” said Kalfon, 27. During the worst parts of captivity, he was so skinny he could count the individual vertebrae jutting from his spine.\n\nNow that he's back home in Dimona in southern Israel, Kalfon is trying to piece together a post-captivity life. He spends much of his time juggling appointments with an array of doctors and psychologists.\n\nOne of the strangest aspects of his release, Kalfon said, is that for two years, his entire life revolved around trying to please his captors, so they might share more food or spare a beating. Now that he's out, \"everyone is trying to please me,” he said.\n\nFrom a family bakery to a Hamas tunnel\n\nBefore being taken hostage at the Nova music festival, Kalfon worked at his family’s bakery in the town of Arad and was studying finance and investments.\n\nWhen rockets started flying at the start of the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, Kalfon said he and his closest friend tried to help others at the festival escape. Kalfon remembers pleading with a group of people who had taken cover in a yellow dumpster, telling them to come with him, that they were in a death trap. For two years, Kalfon wondered what happened to them. After his release, he learned they were all killed.\n\nHamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages during their cross-border assault that day. Israel’s ensuing offensive has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.\n\nWhile in captivity, every moment “felt like an eternity,” Kalfon said. The only thing that broke up the monotony was a meager portion of food and water once a day.\n\nThere were so many times he felt close to death: during frequent bombardment by the Israeli military, going through COVID and other illnesses with no medicine, enduring starvation and frequent physical torture. He said his captors used bicycle chains as whips and pummeled the hostages while wearing large rings to leave painful welts.\n\n“We didn’t even have energy to yell out, because no one hears you,\" he said. “You’re in a tunnel 30 meters underground; no one knows what’s going on.”\n\nThe worst part was the last three months of his captivity, Kalfon said, when he was kept in isolation and felt like he was losing his sanity.\n\nIn the darkest places, faith brings a ray of light\n\nBoth Kalfon and his family, advocating in Israel for his release, further turned to their Jewish faith to get through the dark times. Kalfon’s family filled their homes with additional Jewish books, ritual objects and prayers from senior rabbis.\n\nKalfon and the other five hostages made a tradition of marking the start of Jewish holidays or the Sabbath by saying prayers over a bit of water and moldy pita.\n\nThe hostages used a square of precious toilet paper, where one roll had to last six people for two months, for the ritual skullcap that Jewish men traditionally wear during prayers.\n\nA radio the captors had given to the hostages in hopes of converting them to Islam through recordings of the Quran sometimes allowed them to capture signals from Israeli news.\n\nOnce, when Kalfon was at his lowest and considering an escape attempt, which likely would have led to his death, he turned on the radio and heard his mother’s voice. He said it felt like a divine message to hold on for a little longer.\n\n“I was living in the body of a dead person, living in a grave,” Kalfon said. “To get out of this grave, it’s nothing else if not a miracle.”\n\nKalfon was released along with 19 other living hostages as part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. He considers U.S. President Donald Trump a “messenger from God,” sure that no one else could have halted the fighting. His family has hung nearly a dozen American flags around the house in recognition of the U.S. contribution to his return.\n\nSince his return, Kalfon is getting used to a new life, one where he is famous after his name and face were broadcast across Israel during the fight to release the hostages.\n\n“Everyone wants to support me and say, ‘You’re such a hero,’” Kalfon said. “I don’t feel like a hero. Every person would want to survive.”\n\nKalfon knows he has a long journey to recovery after his years in captivity and a post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis from before he was taken hostage.\n\n“Although the war in Gaza is over, now my war is starting with my soul, to try to deal with thoughts that are very difficult,” he said.\n\nHe tries to keep his schedule busy to distract himself.\n\n“But every night when I’m alone, it comes up,” Kalfon said. Even a small noise can startle him awake and thrust him into a terrifying flashback, so he barely sleeps.\n\nFor the immediate future, he wants to share his story more widely. He said he has been shocked by the rise in global antisemitism and anti-Israel fervor since he was captured and wants to make sure people hear his story, especially those who tore down posters of the hostages or accuse Israel of lying.\n\n“I’m proof that it happened,” he said. “I felt it with my body. I saw it with my own eyes.” ___",

    "fullText": "The Sussexes’ PR problems are back in the spotlight as 2025 draws to a close. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have faced steady blowback around launches and messaging. Now, a fresh staffing shake-up is raising questions about their public image team.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess have built a California-based brand across media and charity work. However, insiders now describe their communications operation as hard to run. Consequently, the search for the right publicist is reportedly becoming more difficult.\n\nAs per Rob Shuter’s Substack report dated December 31, 2025, a senior U.S. publicist resigned. It says Meredith Maines quit after about 10 months in the role. A former staffer said, “The job isn’t hard because of the press,” adding, “It’s hard because of the principals.” The person claimed, “Harry and Meghan are impossible to satisfy.” They also alleged that their “expectations constantly shift.”\n\nMeanwhile, another insider said in the report that top American PR firms are declining the account. The person claimed, “They’re difficult and, frankly, cheap.” The source argued that budgets are a sticking point for Sussex‘s PR strategy. The person said, “Kardashians and Beyoncé spend a fortune on PR.” However, they claimed the couple expects the same results “for a fraction of the budget.”\n\nWith U.S. options narrowing, the report says London strategist Liam Maguire may step up. An insider said they are “cutting costs by eliminating a senior American salary.” Still, the person warned that running a U.S. operation from London brings “huge challenges.” They pointed to time zone strain and “burnout risks.”\n\nIn the Substack report, staffers also described the workplace mood as intense. One source said, “The office is high pressure, constantly shifting.” They added that it can hit “DEFCON 1 over minor issues.” Another insider said, “A competent PR can survive bad headlines.” However, they added, “They can’t survive clients who won’t listen.”\n\nFor now, the claims keep Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s PR issues in a familiar loop. If staffing stabilizes, messaging may settle, too. If it does not, the churn could stay part of the story in 2026.\n\nThe post Royal Couple ‘Impossible To Satisfy’ Amid PR Nightmare — Source appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "Most companies wait until after the holidays to deliver bad news.\n\nIt's not unheard of for people to be laid off right before Christmas, or in the week between Christmas and New Year's, but doing that is seen as especially cruel.\n\nMany companies, however, simply carry out their plans without regard for the holiday season.\n\n\"Historical data shows December often ranks as the second-highest month for layoffs and discharges, going back to 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the month when companies consistently cut the most workers is coming soon —January,\" Mint.com reported.\n\nWaiting until January for layoffs isn't just about being kind, according to Jonathan Reynolds, CEO of recruiting agency Titus Talent Strategies. He advises companies to wait until the new year.\n\n“This is where companies really need to think about their talent reputation,” he said. “Some people who are a little bit more risk-averse would rather go to an organization that cares for its people first.”\n\nSome companies, however, simply have no option, and that appears to be what happened to Sprinkles Cupcakes, which is winding down operations at all remaining locations, according to multiple national media reports.\n\nSprinkles has not shared a formal statement about its shutdown to media, but the news has been confirmed by multiple major news outlets.\n\n\"Sprinkles, the iconic California cupcake company, has announced a 'winding down' of operations at its remaining 15 retail locations, blindsiding employees last minute with the not-so-sweet news,\" the New York Post reported. \"Salty employees got the notice on Dec. 30, saying Sprinkles would start an “orderly wind-down” of the company beginning Dec. 31.\"\n\nThe chain's website has no mention of the shutdown.\n\nSprinkles Founder, Candace Nelson, who sold the brand in 2012, shared a statement on her Instagram page.\n\nTaco Bell and KFC work on simplifying their restaurants\n\nChick-fil-A making major change to 425 restaurants nationwide\n\nBankrupt beer and pizza restaurant chain closes locations\n\nRestaurant chain famed for rude waiters closes multiple locations\n\n\"Today is Sprinkles’ final day. As many of you know, I started Sprinkles in 2005 with a KitchenAid mixer and a big idea. Over the years, we expanded across the country and launched the Cupcake ATM,\" she wrote, noting that since she sold the brand, she has no ownership or operational involvement in the company.\n\n\"Still, it’s surreal to see this chapter come to a close — and it’s not how I imagined the story would unfold,\" she posted. \"I’m deeply grateful to the fans, customers, and community who showed up, celebrated with us, and made Sprinkles part of their traditions — and to the team who made it all happen. I’ll always be proud of what we built.\"\n\nShe also shared that her \"heart\" was with the company's employees.\n\nSprinkles Cupcakes is reportedly closing all of its retail bakery locations nationwide with the final day of operation as December 31, 2025, and doors expected to be shut by January 1, 2026, according to the New York Post.\n\nThe closure includes all storefronts and, apparently, the famed Cupcake ATM locations, the automated vending-style machines that helped make the brand a viral phenomenon when introduced in 2012, reported Parade.\n\nStaff were reportedly given extremely short notice, in some cases just one day, before being laid off, according to employee posts on social media, added Parade.\n\nSprinkles was founded in Beverly Hills in 2005 and helped popularize the gourmet cupcake trend, expanding to about 20 retail locations across six states plus Washington, D.C., and dozens of Cupcake ATMs nationwide, according to its website.\n\nIn my experience covering retail closures, dessert-only chains face a uniquely difficult repeat-visit challenge.\n\nAs a fan of cupcakes, I have visited Sprinkles on occasion, but the business model always seemed flawed to me. Customers might get coffee or other beverages a few times a week, or even every day, but cupcakes seemed too indulgent to drive the repeat business needed for the chain, or really any very-limited menu dessert chain, to succeed.\n\nBuilding dessert-only businesses has been very challenging and overly dependent upon social media. Crumbl, the once-hot cookie chain, has suffered, as it's no longer the social media sensation it once was.\n\n“Social media trends come and go, which is why it isn’t always the smartest idea to go all-in at the height of your 15 minutes of fame, which is arguably what Crumbl Cookies has done. The chain expanded massively throughout 2022 in an effort to meet the soaring market demand generated by videos tagged #crumbl on TikTok,” Mashed shared.\n\nThe chain has closed a number of locations over the past three years, according to a Dec. 20 article from TheStreet.\n\nCrumbl closed 7 stores in 2023: These were the first permanent closures in company history. These included four in California, and one each in Florida, Georgia, and Utah, according to QSR Magazine.\n\n2024: Further closures, with at least 12 locations reported closed during 2024, according to the company’s Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD). These closures were excluded from the annual performance reporting, indicating they occurred at various points in 2024.\n\nPublic closure lists compiled from local reporting include stores such as Norwalk, Conn., and others in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Florida, and Utah, and that does not likely account for every closed store.\n Individual closures reported locally: For example, a Norwalk, Conn., Crumbl Cookies store closed after only about one year in business, underscoring uneven performance among locations, Patch reported.\n\nMore locations have closed in 2025, although the company has not confirmed that.\n\nBoth Sprinkles and Crumbl faced a challenging operating environment for the past two years.\n\n\"The restaurant industry faced significant headwinds in 2024, including higher prices, shifting consumer spending patterns and increased competition,\" said Kevin Schimpf, senior director of industry research at Technomic in the research firm's annual sales report on the top 500 restaurant chains.\n\nRestaurant Business and Technomic data have shown that traffic growth for specialty restaurant concepts has lagged broader industry averages over the past two years.\n\nSprinkles did not respond to a request for comment by publication time and has not issued a public statement on its website or social media channels.",

    "description": "Companies including Amazon, JPMorgan, and AT&T have faced obstacles trying to get employees to return to office.",
    "fullText": "Return-to-office mandates continue to feel like high-level math equations that even the business world’s brightest can’t solve.\n\nAmazon, JPMorgan, and AT&T are among the most recent companies to require a full-time RTOs. But some of these mandates have faced obstacles, including a lack of office space and dissatisfied employees.\n\nAmazon, for example, said in September, it wanted its 350,000-person workforce in the office by early January. As of February, many of their offices didn’t have enough desks to accommodate the return, leaving many employees continuing working from home. AT&T had a similar issue. In response to JPMorgan’s RTO mandate, employees expressed their outrage on an internal platform. The company then disabled comments. Some JPMorgan and Amazon workers have also signed petitions protesting their employers’ requirements.\n\nWhat’s missing from some of these RTO plans is the recognition of a cultural change, said Jennifer Moss, workplace strategist and author of Why Are We Here?: Creating a Work Culture Everyone Wants. The post-pandemic workplace should combine lessons from the pre-pandemic and pandemic-era models, she said.\n\n“When we’re trying to get people back into the office, we still are executing the office in the same way that it used to be,” Moss told HR Brew. “We just can’t jam the toothpaste back in the tube.”\n\nRecognize the new environment. Improved collaboration, culture, and productivity are often cited as reasons for an RTO, Moss said, but being in the office won’t necessarily help employees achieve these goals.\n\n“People are going into the office, unfortunately, it feels very much like what it feels like to be at home,” she said. “You’re still on Zoom, and you’re still spending your day doing the exact same things you could be doing at home. It feels very arbitrary.”\n\nTo facilitate this new era of work, employers should embrace a model Moss called “the third office.” Instead of “pushing” for employees to go back to pre-pandemic norms, she said, employers should consider how they can incorporate the benefits of remote work, like autonomy and flexibility. To that end, a hybrid approach, she said, typically works best.\n\nMoss also urged mindfulness around how the physical office space can affect employees. If a company doesn’t have enough desks, for example, she said HR leaders should rethink how employees work in the office, and create quiet or collaborative spaces outside of the open floor plan.\n\n“The [third office] is a place where you have challenging discussions, where you learn to network, develop soft skills, be able to have team building, build up that social energy and that cohesion,” she said, adding that these activities were undervalued pre-pandemic and lost during the pandemic, and should be part of this new era.\n\nEventually, however, companies that require five days in the office should offer employees their own dedicated workspace, Moss said. It may seem simple, but being able to personalize a desk is something that, she said, may help employees feel more connected to their workplace.\n\nIdentify and communicate the play-by-play. Some executives want RTO to alleviate their own “trust issues,” without considering how it might affect employees, according to John Frehse, the global head of labor strategy at consulting firm Ankura.\n\n“You only trust me when I’m in the office. You don’t trust me when I’m at home. What kind of a worker and employer relationship are we dealing with?” Frehse told HR Brew.\n\nSujay Saha, an employee experience strategist and founder of consulting firm Cortico-X, emphasized the need for a plan. “Don’t make the decision and then try to figure it out, how do I make that decision happen for people…that is the biggest problem in a lot of this,” Saha said. He suggested HR start by identifying employees’ “personas,” like whether they’re working parents or belong to the sandwich generation. This can give HR a sense of employees’ needs and schedules, which can help inform what kind of RTO might make sense.\n\n“There are pros and cons in all of this, so the most important thing that we can tackle is how we do it,” Saha said. “Maybe there is a pace at which you could do it…Reduce the pace and give people that mental adjustment time that is needed genuinely, to take care of their lives before you change [their lives].”\n\nFrehse also advised against focusing an RTO announcement on the enforcement and repercussions of not following the mandate. Instead, communicate the steps and value-add for professional growth.\n\n“It’s both culturally and intellectually lazy to announce a certain number of days of return to office each week, without listing in heavy detail the reasons why—not just benefits for the business, but the benefits for the employee,” he said.\n\nSaha agreed. “Don’t do it, just for the heck of doing it…Be clear about why you’re doing it.”\n\nThis report was originally published by HR Brew.\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on February 28, 2025.",

    "title": "Red Lobster’s 36-year-old CEO led the company after bankruptcy. Now he’s plotting the ‘greatest comeback in the history of the restaurant industry’",
    "description": "“Of course it’s risky,” Damola Adamolekun told Fortune’s Ruth Umoh. “I took over a company that’s bankrupt and had a lot of problems.”",
    "fullText": "Sydney Lake is an associate editor at Fortune, where she writes and edits news for the publication's global news desk.\n\nRed Lobster entered bankruptcy in 2024, but quickly clawed its way out in just about three months. The once-struggling 57-year-old seafood chain had endured an $11 million endless-shrimp fiasco among other mistakes made.\n\nBut under the leadership of Damola Adamolekun, 36, who was previously the CEO of P.F. Chang’s, Red Lobster has officially turned the ship around. As the company continues to recover from bankruptcy, the chain expects positive net income in fiscal 2026, and adjusted EBIDTA is expected to grow 43% from fiscal 2025 to 2027.\n\n“I think this is going to be the greatest comeback in the history of the restaurant industry,” Adamolekun told Fortune’s Ruth Umoh in her vodcast series, The CEO Playbook. “Of course it’s risky; I took over a company that’s bankrupt and had a lot of problems.”\n\nBut Adamolekun, who was featured on Fortune’s inaugural 100 Most Powerful People in Business list, knows about taking risks. He led P.F. Chang’s, an Asian-fusion chain, through the COVID pandemic, returned the company to profitability, and drove major operational and strategic change at the company. Under his leadership, P.F. Chang’s started generating revenues of about $1 billion, according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nThat was “a crazy feat on its face, given the challenges the restaurant and hospitality industry is recovering from: the worst pandemic in 100 years, supply-chain challenges, a shallow labor pool, and a still-uncertain economy,” according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nBut for Adamolekun, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker, that reward was worth the risk—and it could be the same at Red Lobster.\n\n“Investing is the business of risk assessment, and I think you should manage your career the same way,” he told Fortune’s Umoh. “Risk on its own isn’t something to avoid. You just need adequate return.”\n\nSimilar to his P.F. Chang’s playbook, Adamolekun is laser-focused on shattering inefficiencies at Red Lobster. Namely, he said he’d never bring back the endless-shrimp promotion, one of the factors that propelled Red Lobster into bankruptcy in the first place.\n\nIt’s “because I know how to do math,” Adamolekun said plainly during an interview with Today last November. While the $20 endless shrimp deal made quite a splash with customers, the company suffered millions in operating losses.\n\nAdamolekun is also spearheading the company’s $60 million plan to keep the seafood chain afloat by stacking his C-suite with restaurant-industry veterans. His vision is to “inject more energy” into the restaurant locations, Adamolekun told Today, through new lighting, music, and decor.\n\nThat’s in an effort to improve and renovate current locations, while also fixing broken HVAC systems, torn carpets and chairs, and ensuring more locations don’t close in the future. During bankruptcy, Red Lobster shuttered dozens of locations. Now the chain operates about 500.\n\nAdamolekun has also said he wants to “lower the check” for customers, making it more affordable to dine there.\n\n“We should be the best deal for the best lobster because we do have the best product,” Adamolekun told Today.\n\nSimilar to other restaurant chains like Chili’s, Red Lobster is working to pare down its menu, eliminating items that don’t perform as well to increase restaurant efficiencies. Red Lobster also ran its Lobsterfest promotion in 2025, offering items like $20 lobster rolls and unlimited Cheddar Bay Biscuits. The company also introduced a happy hour menu and brought back other fan favorites, SeafoodSource reported.\n\nWhile that’s a lot of change in a relatively short period of time, Adamolekun isn’t shying away in his comeback plan.\n\n“Some people refuse to set ambitious goals because they’re terrified of failure,” he told Fortune’s Umoh. “I’m not afraid of that. I don’t mind setting really high goals, and I don’t mind going after difficult things. You do your best and try to win.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on October 1, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping is pleased with his country's showing in the race for AI dominance.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address on Wednesday, the Chinese leader lauded his country's tech and AI advancements in 2025, saying that China \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" Xi said in the speech made in Beijing.\n\nHe added, \"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities.\"\n\nApart from developments in AI, Xi also highlighted China's Tianwen-2 asteroid sampling mission and its latest electromagnetic catapult system-equipped aircraft carrier.\n\nHe talked about China breaking ground on the construction of the world's largest dam in Tibetan territory, and its progress in developing humanoid robots and drones.\n\nXi's end-of-year 2025 comments follow a strong year for the country, which saw it compete neck and neck with the US on AI advancements.\n\nThe year started with China's Deepseek AI startup releasing its R1 AI model in January, which rivalled OpenAI's o1 and sent US tech stocks plunging. Nvidia, a major player in AI hardware, saw its stock drop by more than 17% on January 27, erasing billions from its value.\n\nThe US's ban on exporting advanced AI chips has given a boost to China's homegrown chip producers, propelling their founders, such as MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai's cofounder Chen Weiliang, into the billionaire ranks.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump granted Nvidia a win in December, permitting it to sell its H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China.\n\nAnd Meta announced on Wednesday that it would acquire China-founded AI startup Manus in a deal reported to be worth more than $2 billion, making it one of the US tech's biggest acquisitions of an Asian AI company.\n\nInvestors are taking note: Jason Draho, a UBS wealth management executive, told Business Insider in November that investors should consider AI stocks in China as a way to counterbalance US tech stocks.",

    "description": "DeepSeek has released a new AI training method that analysts say is a \"breakthrough\" for scaling large language models.",
    "fullText": "DeepSeek got the year rolling with a new idea for training AI. And analysts say it could have a massive impact on the industry.\n\nThe Chinese AI startup published a research paper on Wednesday, describing a method to train large language models that could shape \"the evolution of foundational models,\" it said.\n\nThe paper, co-authored by its founder Liang Wenfeng, introduces what DeepSeek calls \"Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections,\" or mHC, a training approach designed to scale models without them becoming unstable or breaking altogether.\n\nAs language models grow, researchers often try to improve performance by allowing different parts of a model to share more information internally. However, this increases the risk of the information becoming unstable, the paper said.\n\nDeepSeek's latest research enables models to share richer internal communication in a constrained manner, preserving training stability and computational efficiency even as models scale, it added.\n\nWei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider on Friday that the approach is a \"striking breakthrough.\"\n\nDeepSeek combined various techniques to minimize the extra cost of training a model, Sun said. She added that even with a slight increase in cost, the new training method could yield much higher performance.\n\nSun said the paper reads as a statement of DeepSeek's internal capabilities. By redesigning the training stack end-to-end, the company is signaling that it can pair \"rapid experimentation with highly unconventional research ideas.\"\n\nDeepseek can \"once again, bypass compute bottlenecks and unlock leaps in intelligence,\" she said, referring to its \"Sputnik moment\" in January 2025, when the company unveiled its R1 reasoning model.\n\nThe launch shook the tech industry and the US stock market, showing that the R1 model could match top competitors, such as ChatGPT's o1, at a fraction of the cost.\n\nLian Jye Su, the chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research and consulting firm, told Business Insider on Friday that the published research could have a ripple effect across the industry, with rival AI labs developing their own versions of the approach.\n\n\"The willingness to share important findings with the industry while continuing to deliver unique value through new models showcases a newfound confidence in the Chinese AI industry,\" Su said of DeepSeek's paper. Openness is embraced as \"a strategic advantage and key differentiator,\" he added.\n\nThe paper comes as DeepSeek is reportedly working toward the release of its next flagship model R2, following an earlier postponement.\n\nR2, which had been expected in mid-2025, was delayed after Liang expressed dissatisfaction with the model's performance, according to a June report by The Information. The report said the launch was also complicated by shortages of advanced AI chips, a constraint that has increasingly shaped how Chinese labs train and deploy frontier models.\n\nWhile the paper does not mention R2, its timing has raised eyebrows. DeepSeek previously published foundational training research ahead of its R1 model launch.\n\nSu said DeepSeek's track record suggests the new architecture will \"definitely be implemented in their new model.\"\n\nSun, on the other hand, is more cautious. \"There is most likely no standalone R2 coming,\" Sun said. Since DeepSeek has already integrated earlier R1 updates in its V3 model, the technique could form the backbone of DeepSeek's V4 model, she added.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in June that DeepSeek's updates to its R1 model failed to generate much traction in the tech industry. Barr argued that distribution matters, and DeepSeek still lacks the broad reach enjoyed by leading AI labs — such as OpenAI and Google — particularly in Western markets.",

    "title": "We tried 4 AI matchmaking apps. We're still single.",
    "description": "We tried four AI matchmakers, including Amata, Sitch, and Three Day Rule, and went on the dates they arranged. Let's talk about it.",
    "fullText": "Did AI matchmakers put an end to our single eras?\n\nSpoiler alert: No. But we gave them a shot.\n\nWe tried four AI matchmaking apps to see if any would deliver the loves of our lives. We spent weeks messaging with chatbot matchmakers, voting yay or nay on selected profiles, and even going on some dates.\n\nThe pools varied in size, from giants like Facebook Dating (with its 21 million users) to smaller startups like Sitch, Amata, and Three Day Rule. Sitch and Amata both have raised millions of dollars to build a new style of dating app where, instead of swiping through profiles, you get paired with an AI matchmaker — a chatbot — who brings you new matches.\n\nThe apps also tout focus on dating with more intention.\n\n\"We don't want people who are not emotionally available, who are on dating apps just for their ego boost,\" Amata founder Ludovic Huraux previously told Business Insider.\n\nOur big takeaway: They're still dating apps. There are helpful features, such as slowing down the swiping process or taking over date planning. However, they don't stop the fatigue that has affected stalwarts like Hinge and Tinder.\n\nLet's talk about how it went down.\n\nSydney Bradley: The first test: Henry, did you go on any dates?\n\nHenry Chandonnet: I did! I got drinks with a guy I matched with on Amata. Beyond that, it was slim pickings. Sitch offered me a bunch of profiles it thought I'd be compatible with, but never made any matches. Maybe I was too picky — there were a lot of finance bros. Three Day Rule didn't even offer any matches (rude), and Facebook kept recommending me people who were too far away.\n\nSydney: I tried the same apps, and similarly, didn't get too far. Facebook's AI \"dating assistant\" delivered me some potential people, but I didn't get any standout recommendations from its almost weekly messages. Definitely not enough to warrant a full night of my time. Three Day Rule did come back to me with a couple of people in the weeks I tested it out, but nothing that led to a date.\n\nI did end up going on dates from both Sitch and Amata, though. I've been using Sitch for several months now, and recently went on my first date from the app after paying $90 for three \"set-ups.\" One thing that Amata especially has going for it is that the app plans the date for you and requires you to pay $25 to commit to a date beforehand.\n\nThese are all pretty early-stage apps and features — even Facebook's AI dating tools only launched a few weeks ago.\n\nSydney: What are your thoughts on the tech of it all?\n\nHenry: Excluding Amata (which actually worked!), Sitch was my favorite. The UX was great, and the chatbot was friendly. But the cost is so high that it's no wonder I didn't get any set-ups. Who's paying that?\n\nFacebook Dating was my least favorite by far. I don't love the idea of being able to search for my perfect boyfriend. Like, it shouldn't be this easy! I shouldn't be able to type in \"guy who lives in Park Slope, makes over $100k, and likes reading and old movies\" and be able to find him. Of course, I couldn't — the matches never seemed to fit the searches. (If you fit that description, DM me.)\n\nSydney: My main takeaway: AI can't fix me. Dating is WORK. I'm still feeling dating app burnout, and messaging a bot instead of swiping didn't really change all that much for me.\n\nI ended up having to cancel one Amata date because I truly didn't have the time to fit it into my schedule (there goes my potential soulmate and $25).\n\nThe idea of AI taking over the heavy lifting of sifting through the seemingly endless options of people to date is nice, but it's not so clear to me if the apps are radically different, or rather, a slowed-down version of swiping wrapped up in AI.\n\nHenry: I get that. I'm not sure these apps fix the dating app fatigue that we've all been feeling. I know it well: I'm on four apps, and for the last year have gone through bouts of deleting and redownloading. These apps seemed to add to the burden, rather than take away — another thing to check before bed.\n\nThat is what I liked about Amata, though. Messaging is always the worst part of Tinder or Hinge; I could swipe all day, but I don't want to have to think up witty responses. Amata didn't even let me do that. It planned the date, the time, and made a reservation for us. I could only message my match within two hours of the date. It made it easier to say \"yes.\"\n\nSydney: That's something the founder of Amata, Ludovic Huraux, emphasized when I interviewed him recently — it's the app's goal to get people on dates, instead of messaging. Other dating apps have also dabbled in the actual date-planning of it all, such as Breeze.\n\nOn Amata — as well as Sitch and Three Day Rule — you don't design your profile in the same way you might on other dating apps. The LLMs you talk to (who, by the way, ask a lot of personal questions) write that for you. Do I trust what they're telling other people about me? Maybe. But it's a different experience from toiling over what to answer in dating app prompts.\n\nHenry: It also eliminated what I find to be the most challenging part: writing a bio. I hate all my Hinge prompt answers. Always have, always will.\n\nHenry: What did you think about the matching process?\n\nSydney: The way that the app lets you know there's a potential somebody out there for you is attention-grabbing by teasing that it may have found someone to meet. Then, once they present you with the profile (which includes photos and a brief bio written by the AI), you respond yay or nay.\n\nOne thing that's useful (only if the other person has provided relevant information) is that you can ask follow-up questions, such as \"Do they have a dog?\" Or \"What kind of music do they listen to?\" One aspect that I found interesting, though, is how the bot will ask you why you said no to someone, which isn't something you typically think about when swiping through stacks of profiles. But answering those questions … can be jarring. It makes you think!\n\nHenry: I don't want to tell Amata that I said no because he had bad taste in music!\n\nI also found it funny that we had to select characters for our matchmakers. I chose a brunette with bushy eyebrows and a beard as my Amata AI. The illusion that I'm talking to someone about the matches felt a bit odd. ChatGPT doesn't need a human face to get me talking. But I liked the messaging interface, because it slowed me down. I actually took some time to consider my matches, rather than quickly swiping past them based on looks.\n\nSydney: Mine had some sass. If I said no to someone, it would respond with an AI-generated image of a woman (who, by the way, looked a little like Scarlett Johansen) saying \"Ouch!\"\n\nHenry: They were so funny. Mine gave me an image of a man dressed up as Sherlock Holmes saying, \"Keep searching.\"\n\nSydney: I got scolded by my AI matchmaker for missing the window to agree to a date it set up for me.\n\n\"Going forward, if you fail to set up a date again when you have an intro, I'll need to pause presenting people to you for seven days unfortunately,\" the AI wrote me. \"Because we want to avoid disappointing them if they can't get a real date with you.\"\n\nHenry: That's so menacing! I get it, though… those are $25 dates. Which makes me wonder: outside this experiment — a.k.a. an expensed experiment — would you ever actually pay for an app like this?\n\nSydney: Well, thankfully, people do get refunds if you get canceled on by someone like … me. But I've paid for other apps like Raya before, which cost $30 a month, and I actually paid to join Sitch long before this story assignment, so I guess my answer is: Yes.\n\nHenry: I've also paid for Raya, but that feels different to me. You're paying for the (ostensibly) exclusive club of (ostensibly) better singles. The Amata pool was open-access like Hinge or Tinder — it just had a new way of connecting you within the pool. I'm not sure I'd pay for that.\n\nHenry: Anyways, how was the date?\n\nSydney: That's obviously what everyone is here to know! The date was nice — Amata scheduled it at a brewery, where we ordered drinks and hot dogs. I'm not too much of a beer gal, but the conversation was fun. We haven't set up another time to see each other again, but time will tell. Where did Amata send you off to?\n\nHenry: We met at Bar Belly, a classic Lower East Side bar with really uncomfortable stools. I had to go up to the hostess and say, \"Hi, I'm here with Amata.\" That was embarrassing. The date was fine, but we haven't set up a second. My lips are sealed, other than that. I promised my date I wouldn't go into too much detail.\n\nSydney: Did your Amata ask how the date went? Hinge has asked me if I've met up with someone before, but Amata asked how I would describe the guy's personality and if we had any next steps planned. The day-after follow-up felt a little like how a friend might text you asking how your date went.\n\nHenry: Mine asked me, too. I ghosted — something even AI can't take away from me.",

    "description": "Respondents to Business Insider's survey were split between in-person and virtual work. The virtual option won out by one vote.",
    "fullText": "We asked: Would you prefer a $240,000 in-office job or a $120,000 remote one?\n\nThe Business Insider readers who responded were split down the middle, with the lower-paying virtual job narrowly winning out by just one vote.\n\n365 readers answered Business Insider's informal survey following the debate's TikTok virality. 183 answered that they would choose the $120,000 remote gig, while 182 chose to go five days in-person for double the salary.\n\nIn follow-up conversations, eight respondents — four on each side — explained to Business Insider why they made their choices.\n\nWhile the reader survey isn't scientific, the results, and the reasons people gave us for why they voted the way they did, offer insight into how workers today view the tradeoffs.\n\nIn 2018, Arlton Lowry packed a bag and traveled from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Bali.\n\nThe 44-year-old owner of a digital product design agency spent seven weeks working remotely, waking up at 1 a.m. and scootering through paddy fields to a coworking space where he clocked in on Central Time.\n\nLowry voted for the remote option. That trip wouldn't be possible if his company wasn't remote-first, he said, and the flexibility is a benefit for his employees as well.\n\n\"If it wasn't for remote-based work, we probably wouldn't be able to attract and retain the talent that we have,\" he said.\n\nRespondents who chose the lower-salary remote option prized flexibility and the absence of a rigid corporate culture. It's about more than doing your laundry or squeezing in a workout, they said; it's about freedom.\n\nBetty Chen said she was tired of dealing with other people's egos. After corporate jobs at Autodesk and Cisco, Chen decided to go freelance before the pandemic. Now, the 49-year-old San Francisco resident does contract UX design and boards dogs in her home.\n\n\"I'm so much happier,\" Chen said. \"I did better working with animals, not doomscrolling. Touch grass.\"\n\nChen also enjoys not having to put on makeup. \"As a woman going into the office, there's another half hour of maintenance,\" she said.\n\nThose who chose the in-person option say that flexibility comes at the cost of organizational performance. American Edge Project CEO Doug Kelly said that there was a \"chemistry\" to bringing people together.\n\n\"I would rather pay people more to be on-site working with me,\" the 60-year-old Columbus, Ohio resident said. \"It increases the product that the company is making and the creativity overall.\"\n\nDominic Sharlette agreed: \"You have to be in the office to get great products made.\"\n\nSharlette is a 59-year-old health tech worker based in New York. He works five days in-person, and said he is happy that way. Jobs like customer service could be done remotely, he said, but work that's \"pushing innovation\" must be done face-to-face.\n\nThen there's the salary question. The prompt offered double the pay — $240,000 compared to $120,000 — for in-person attendance. For some, the money was enough.\n\nJennifer Rasmussen, a 44-year-old logistics worker from Fargo, North Dakota, likes her fully remote job. As she called me, her golden retrievers lay next to her. But the perks of $240,000 were too strong not to influence her vote.\n\n\"The quality of life for my entire family would improve with a salary at that level,\" she said.\n\nRasmussen's kids are still young. The money would help her family travel internationally or hire childcare and cleaning help. She could also save more money for retirement, she said.\n\nAmy Leonard, a 42-year-old community college teacher from San Jose, California, said she would choose the virtual job so she could move elsewhere. The Bay Area has a notoriously high cost of living. Leonard said that most of her money now went to basic expenses, such as gas and food.\n\n\"I could definitely take that, move somewhere else, and probably own a house instead of having to rent,\" Leonard said.\n\nIn her debate-sparking TikTok, influencer Tinx said that she could immediately guess the generation of the individual consider the half-salary remote option: Gen Z.\n\nIn the video, Tinx said that time in the office could do Gen Z some good. \"It'll make you all less weird,\" she said.\n\nPriya Chaudhari, a 20-year-old student at the University of Georgia, said that much of her generation actually preferred to be in-person. The in-office push was a \"rebound\" from an adolescence on screens, she said. Chaudhari and some of her friends have chosen to get off social media.\n\nChaudhari said she would opt for the $240,000 salary, citing the pay difference and her own extroversion. \"I really thrive off working with other people,\" she said.\n\nPedro Ochoa posed the question to his four-person team. The 45-year-old manager of business intelligence said the team was split generationally, with the younger colleagues opting for higher pay and the older colleagues choosing the remote work role.\n\nYounger workers see \"very hard outcomes for their careers,\" the Dallas resident said, so they want to claim as much income and experience as they can while they're still employed. Older workers care more about raising their families, he said.\n\nOchoa put himself in the latter camp. He'd take the remote option.",

    "description": "Check out five of Business Insider's most popular stories from its year-long series on America's oldest workers, titled 80 Over 80.",
    "fullText": "A 90-year-old working as a cook at a convenience store. A 93-year-old applying for jobs. An 81-year-old who had to leave her Home Depot job early because she struggled to breathe. These are among the most impactful stories of Business Insider's 80 over 80 series.\n\nBusiness Insider spent most of 2025 interviewing Americans in their 80s and beyond who are still working. We followed hundreds of older workers across the country as they navigated rising costs, health challenges, perceived ageism, and changing ideas about what work and retirement are supposed to look like.\n\nReaders responded strongly to these stories, and we received hundreds of notes from people of all ages sharing their perspectives on the issues the series explored. Many shared their own experiences with working late into their careers, highlighting the value of work and the challenges of clocking in each day. Others who were much younger shared that the stories gave them a new perspective on aging and preparing for retirement.\n\nHere are five of the stories that resonated the most — ones readers spent the most time with and shared widely. Together, they offer a revealing look at what readers were most eager to learn about when it comes to working late in life.\n\nLydia Hinds, now 82, wrote to me back in 2024 about how she worked part-time at Home Depot after a series of mistakes and unfortunate events. Her business closed at the start of the pandemic, and much of her and her husband's money never came back after the 2008 recession. She also said she had heart failure, which made her job much more challenging. Lydia's daughter doesn't speak with her, and they had no other people to rely on financially.\n\nOver the course of a few months, I got to know Lydia and her husband, Bill, before making the three-hour trip to central Connecticut, where I spent two days with them. I shadowed Lydia at work and spoke with her coworkers, ate dinner with them at their home, and drove with Bill to a doctor's appointment. I was joined by a photographer, who captured them in their moments of vulnerability, joy, and uncertainty.\n\nThe story resonated far and wide. Leading experts in the aging and retirement space reached out to share their praise, calling the story \"magnificent\" and \"heartbreaking.\" Dozens of workers in similar situations shared their stories candidly. Younger readers wrote to me that they hoped to never be in her situation.\n\nSince the article came out, Lydia stopped working for Home Depot as her condition worsened and has invested most of her time in founding an online business selling funny gift cards, bags, and clothes.\n\nI first connected with Patricia Willson, now 94, in August. Over multiple phone calls, we spoke for hours about her life in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, a small tourist town in the Ozark Mountains. I visited her for two days in September with a photographer so I could see how she lived, what applying to jobs looked like at 93, and how work and severe health challenges intermingled.\n\nPoignant scenes from that trip — her having her leg wrapped by her nurse, sitting at her computer editing her cover letter, and showing me her mother's bible — illustrated Willson's fight to stay as healthy as she could while trying to find another income source.\n\nThe article resonated with readers who were themselves struggling with health issues while traversing the difficult job market. Willson's story, along with a half dozen others featured in the article, sparked discussions online about what went wrong such that people in their 80s and 90s have to work while battling cancer, lymphedema, back issues, or heart failure. This story was particularly popular among readers in their 50s and 60s, some of whom feared they would face similar challenges.\n\nThis popular story was our main foray into data analysis for the series. For the first time in the media, we broke down the demographics of America's oldest workers, along with the industries and occupations they work in. The results were somewhat surprising — working at schools was the most common industry, though construction was second. Thousands of workers were truck drivers, retail salespeople, personal care aides, and farmers.\n\nThis oldest workforce, which continues to grow, is very diverse, and many readers were shocked by the number of workers still going into their 80s and 90s. Some readers remarked that the data suggested older workers were much more valuable in certain industries than they may have imagined. Many also remarked that it will be less rare in a few years to see people working at 85.\n\nThis was the most popular story of the series, written as a personal essay as told to a reporter. Richard Smith, 81, had reached out to share his story about \"work camping,\" which is when people take on work while living in RVs or campers. In Smith's case, he found work at a campsite in New Hampshire for half the year; the other half of the year, he lives in Florida. He supplements his income by driving for DoorDash.\n\nSmith was able to follow his passions while needing to work for financial reasons. The lifestyle in many ways is cheaper than the daily costs of living in a house, but in some ways, it was a forced decision, as he didn't save enough for retirement.\n\nMany readers were surprised that at 81, Smith was working seven days a week and living out of his motor coach. Some readers applauded his creativity and his nontraditional living situation, with some writing that they would consider work camping for themselves. Others said his story put them at ease, as he was able to make life work with limited assets. A few readers commented that they viewed his optimism as inspiring, as he had many options if his health or finances went further south.\n\nThis story on Vince Scidone, now 91, blew up in the days after it was posted in early September. Scidone, a former carpenter, works part-time for a convenience store chain in Oklahoma, earning $14.90 an hour as a cook. He is on his feet for much of the day in the job, which was one of the only ones he could find when he started looking last year after months of rejections.\n\nWhat readers grasped onto about Scidone's story was how, at 89, he began applying for jobs after his wife got sick. Since she could no longer work, Scidone said the extra income was necessary for helping them stay afloat after a recent home purchase. His health hasn't interfered too much with his job.\n\nReaders found it compelling that Scidone was so positive about his situation, even though he wishes he could retire and never have to worry about money. Some were heartbroken by how he felt guilty for not having a lot of money to pass down to their children and grandchildren. As with many readers, Scidone spoke about his situation while in a state of limbo, where he plays every day by ear. His uncertainty, and his grit, stayed with readers, as some attested to in emails.",

    "description": "Justin Flint, 27,  has one big piece of advice for getting promoted after he went from the assembly line to software engineer at the same company.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Justin Flint, 27, a software engineer at an oven manufacturing factory near Seattle, Washington. His employment and progression has been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe first full-time job I could get after I dropped out of college in 2019 was in a factory building ovens, and it was miserable.\n\nInside the ovens, I'd be drenched in sweat and my safety glasses would fog up. I'd step out, wipe them off with my shirt, and get back to work, because that was my only option.\n\nIt was horrible transitioning from taking mechanical engineering classes at college to working in a factory in the early hours of the morning. But one thing I've learned over the years is the importance of patience.\n\nSometimes you need to stick at something long enough for opportunities to materialize. When they do, you can showcase your skills and move up in the world. That's what happened to me, and now I'm a software engineer at the same company.\n\nI fell in love with inventing things when I was a kid, and started 3D printing things as a teenager. One of my first inventions was a lid that stopped your knuckles from getting dirty when scraping peanut butter out from the bottom of a jar.\n\nIn 2017, I transferred from a college to a community college to be closer to home and continued studying mechanical engineering, then dropped out in 2019 to heal from a traumatic situation. I needed a full-time job and got hired to work on the assembly line at a local factory.\n\nThe job put me in a dark place. You'd show up before your 5 a.m. shift in steel-toe boots, wait in line to clock in, and then walk to your section of the assembly line.\n\nI remember thinking that my career had crumbled. I was working in a factory, I still wanted to be an engineer, and I knew I could do more.\n\nTwice a day, an engineer would oversee my work: using gauges to set sheet-metal shutters in the ovens. I was taking longer than management wanted, so the engineer asked me if I could find a way to do it faster or more efficiently.\n\nOne day, in May 2019, I wrote the dimensions of the gauges for each shutter on a sticky note. At home, I designed a fixture that would speed up my work by letting me set two shutters at once. I 3D printed it at home before my next shift, and took it in to show the engineer.\n\nAbout a week later, the engineer's boss came to the assembly line to ask if I had any experience with coding 3D printers, and I told him I had a tiny bit. A couple of weeks after that, I was asked to join the engineers for a brainstorm after work, which felt like a huge compliment.\n\nIn September, a position opened up for an engineering technician who would work on 3D designing sheet-metal parts for the ovens and printing inserts that would be used for oven handles. After applying and not hearing for a couple of months, I was thrilled to be selected for the job in December, which started in February 2020.\n\nI was intimidated at first, but proud that I'd moved up from the assembly line.\n\nAbout six months into the job, my manager asked me if I'd be willing to return to school if the company paid for it. It was a very easy \"yes,\" but it was hard to make it work. Five days a week, I drove for 40 minutes straight from work to school, took an hour-long class, and then drove back home.\n\nIt felt great to be back at school, learning C++, a programming language used for building software, and discovering how coding could open the door to developing things like apps. I realized coding was a missing component of my skillset.\n\nBut I was starting to feel burned out, so I decided to leave the oven factory in May 2022 to make more time for my studies.\n\nIn March 2023, I got my associate degree in engineering, computer science, and physics after studying full-time for about nine months. It was great to finally have something to show for all my years of hard work. It also gave me a safety net, a qualification that would prevent me from returning to the assembly line.\n\nWhen I finished college I needed another full-time job. The only one I could find was at a printing factory as a technician, loading large printers with paper and performing maintenance on them. Back to working in factories, I felt like a failure.\n\nIf I ever completed printing jobs early, I would go on my phone and listen to podcasts or watch YouTube tutorials on coding. I fell in love with programming.\n\nIn June 2023, the oven factory reached out and offered me a software developer position. When I took the job, it felt like being back home. I'll always appreciate them taking a bet on me.\n\nIt was a place where I'd originally not enjoyed working, because I saw it only for my job on the assembly line. But I felt like I was where I belonged when I returned as a software developer.\n\nI'm a software engineer II at the oven factory, which involves managing software projects, and my goal is to become a chief technology officer. The prospect of defining technological paths forward and designing tools that make people's lives easier sounds so exciting. It would take me back to my roots: inventing things.\n\nIt's what got me off the assembly line job, and if I hadn't taken the initiative to build a fixture and show it to the engineering team, I'd never have been promoted.\n\nUltimately, I had to step on a few toes— politely — to show what I was capable of.\n\nIt's easy to get stuck in a rut — trust me, I've been there — but I've learned that you can often invent your way out of a horrible situation. You simply need to search for opportunities to prove yourself.\n\nIf you study the work you do every day closely enough, you'll find something to improve, and that improvement could be your golden ticket to promotion.",

When firms take longer to lock in new money, they often slow hiring and get stingier with titles, as it's easier for them to justify new seats and promotions after a close.\n\nUS venture firms raised $45.7 billion across 376 funds through the third quarter, putting the industry on track for its lowest annual haul since 2017, according to the PitchBook-NVCA Venture Monitor. Fund managers took a median of 15.6 months to close a fund, up from 9.7 months in 2022, PitchBook found.\n\nFor women — a minority of dealmakers — the chill can feel even colder. And yet, women continued to advance.

    "description": "Aryan Poduri's book, \"GOAT Coder,\" teaches children how to code through hands-on exercises and uncomplicated explanations.",
    "fullText": "Learning a new language can be tricky, especially when it involves a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols that combine to form computer code.\n\n\"When you're first understanding the concept of what goes behind screens, it's hard to wrap your head around,\" Aryan Poduri, a 17-year-old based in California, told Business Insider.\n\nSo, Poduri wrote a book to demystify the versatile programming language known as Python. Called \"GOAT Coder,\" it teaches children how to code through hands-on exercises and uncomplicated explanations.\n\nAlthough coding education is becoming increasingly accessible, there are still gaps in connecting with young students. In a 2023 research report supported by Apple, surveyed students said being unsure of where to start is the most significant barrier to learning how to code.\n\n\"There are all these different careers. Firefighters, police, scientists, but software engineering is something that you might not think about,\" Poduri said. \"It's important for people to know that coding is a big marketplace and it's an option.\"\n\nPublished in April, the book has sold over 2,000 copies to date.\n\nGrowing up, Poduri initially had dreams of becoming a professional athlete, but technology was a constant in his life. He grew up in Mountain House, which is about two hours east of Silicon Valley in San Francisco.\n\n\"That definitely had an impact because, around here, everyone is coding,\" Poduri said.\n\nBoth of Poduri's parents work in the tech industry and started teaching him how to code at a young age. That sparked an early curiosity. He sharpened his skills through a beginner's Python class in elementary school and by picking up tips from YouTube videos.\n\nHis interest in coding became more serious in middle school. Around that time, Poduri developed his first computer program: Voto Polo, a web app he and his friends used to create and vote on polls.\n\n\"That's when I realized this could be a future for me,\" Poduri said.\n\nHis early coding days led him to compete in hackathons and an internship at DataDios, a data and AI company based in San Francisco. The idea for \"GOAT Coder,\" though, came while watching his parents try to teach his elementary school-aged sister how to code.\n\n\"My parents were spending a lot of time just trying to help her understand,\" Poduri said. \"I realize it's because there aren't really many resources.\"\n\nIt's a problem he also recognized after enrolling part-time at Stanford Online High School, which allowed him to take advanced courses that may not be available to the average student.\n\nPoduri self-published his book, which he said meant he didn't have to worry about meeting tight deadlines.\n\n\"The first challenge was figuring out how I wanted to teach it,\" Poduri said. \"It was almost like I had to make my own curriculum.\"\n\nHe also had to ensure that the concepts were explained in a clear and concise manner that a young child could grasp.\n\n\"It's been years since I started coding, so I didn't remember what I wanted to know or what really excited me,\" Poduri said.\n\nStill, he finished the book in about nine months. Poduri said he could have written it faster, but he had to juggle school and his extracurricular hobbies.\n\n\"I was having fun while doing it,\" Poduri said.\n\nAlthough Poduri is now focused on promoting \"GOAT Coder\" and his college applications, he's already thinking about his next steps, like diving further into the tech industry and software engineering.\n\nHe's already authored two research papers about DataDios' SmartDiff, which helps validate data across private and public cloud platforms.\n\nOutside of technology, Poduri said he'd like to explore other areas of the business world.\n\n\"One of my long-term career goals is to eventually become an entrepreneur,\" Poduri said. \"I don't want to be stuck to just coding. I really enjoy learning about new subjects and new things.\"\n\nHe hasn't ruled out writing a follow-up book, either.",

    "description": "Image and video capabilities could give Gemini a crucial leg up.",
    "fullText": "Another year, another slate of potential AI breakthroughs.\n\nFour partners at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz debated what 2026 might bring to the AI world on an episode of the company's podcast that aired December 29, 2025. They focused on some of the biggest consumer LLMs. including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Cursor, Perplexity, and Grok.\n\nHere's what they think this year might bring to the AI race.\n\nGemini 3's video and image models might give it a significant leg up over ChatGPT, Justine Moore, an investment partner, said, since there's \"always nearly infinite demand\" for those capabilities among both professional and everyday users.\n\n\"So many new viral trends are created around new capabilities of the best-in-class image and video models,\" she said.\n\nThat can drive users to new products, Moore added. If Gemini keeps up the momentum, it could overcome the challenge of ChatGPT's name recognition.\n\n\"What happens when you can put a video in and get images out that are related to or the next iteration of the video? Or you can put a video in and a text prompt about what you want to edit, and get the edited video out?\" she said.\n\nThe changes could also have a big impact on the design world, which often includes combining text and images in creative ways.\n\nWhether ChatGPT's internal version of the app store is successful could be its \"defining question for the next year,\" Olivia Moore, one of the partners, said. At launch, app partners included Spotify and Zillow, among others.\n\nThe model's software development kit, which lets developers build their own apps for ChatGPT, could be crucial for both consumer and enterprise use, Anish Acharya, another partner, said. Combined, these features will allow ChatGPT to work more like an app store.\n\nIf startups want to succeed, they might want to steer clear of text-in, text-out models, since existing models are so dominant.\n\n\"You have to be creative around, what is the angle that you can go steal people away from?\" said Bryan Kim, a partner.\n\nOlivia Moore said there are early signs that the world of LLM assistants might be trending toward \"winner take all, or at least winner take most.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the sheer number of users, ChatGPT has a sizable lead over its competitors, with between 800 and 900 million weekly active users. Moore said that Google's Gemini reached around 35% of that scale on the web and around 40% on mobile devices. The other models come in at between 8 and 10%, she said.\n\nMoore also said later in the episode that ChatGPT Enterprise, which businesses can use, could spur growth. Weekly messages in ChatGPT Enterprise increased by around eightfold in 2025, OpenAI said.\n\n\"If we're entering a world now where people have to use ChatGPT for their company or as part of their work, that could really translate into consumer usage,\" she said.\n\nYet if the past few months are any indication, Moore said \"things are changing very quickly,\" and Gemini is growing desktop users at a faster rate than ChatGPT. Other LLMs, like Claude, are offering capabilities that cater to specialized consumers, like the uber-technical.",

    "description": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is warning about an AI bubble. Some other lawmakers aren't sure if they see one yet.",
    "fullText": "Are we in the middle of an AI bubble? Ask a lawmaker, and they probably won't have a definitive take for you.\n\n\"If I knew that, I'd be in a different line of work,\" Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents much of Silicon Valley, told Business Insider in November.\n\nThe AI bubble debate has been raging in the tech world since August, when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that investors had grown \"overexcited\" about the technology.\n\nThere are also concerns about circular spending patterns among tech companies investing in AI technology, and fears that companies won't be able to recoup the billions of dollars they're spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. Bill Gates has explicitly compared it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.\n\nThose concerns have made their way to Wall Street, with stock prices of major tech companies beginning to wobble.\n\nHowever, many in the tech world remain confident that there's no bubble, citing continued high demand for AI products.\n\n\"Are we in an AI bubble? I have no idea,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told Business Insider in November. \"Even the AI people don't know.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that while she was unsure whether there's a bubble, she's concerned by \"how much of the economic activity in the stock market and across the country is driven by this one sector.\"\n\n\"If it is overvalued, when that bubble pops, it's going to be felt everywhere,\" Warren said. \"The concentration makes the economy far more vulnerable than it otherwise would be.\"\n\nOne of the few lawmakers who's been outspoken about the potential for a bubble is Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who said at a hearing in November that we may be in a \"massive economic bubble\" that could pose \"2008-style threats to economic stability.\"\n\n\"Should this bubble pop, we should not be entertaining a bailout,\" Ocasio-Cortez added. \"We should not entertain a bailout of these corporations, as healthcare is being denied to everyday Americans, as SNAP and food assistance is being denied to everyday Americans, precipitating some of the very mental crises that people are turning to AI chatbots to try to resolve in themselves.\"\n\nThe debate began making its way to Capitol Hill as the Trump administration and some Republicans in Congress look for ways to make it easier for the AI industry to do business.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, when asked, has largely shrugged off questions about whether he's worried about a bubble.\n\n\"I guess. I worry about everything,\" Trump said in an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month. \"I hope it's gonna be very good. But if it's not so good, we're protected.\"\n\nTrump signed an executive order in December aiming at restricting the ability of states to regulate AI, tasking the Department of Justice with suing states that have \"onerous\" AI laws on the books.\n\nThat executive order is likely to see legal challenges, and it's ultimately less strong than a law passed by Congress would have been. But Republicans have been at odds with one another over the policy, beginning over the summer as Congress considered the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThat bill originally included a provision that would have blocked states from enacting some regulations on AI for 10 years. It was strongly supported by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee who's positioned himself as an ally of the AI industry on Capitol Hill. It was later stripped out of the megabill in a 99-1 vote.\n\nWhen asked last week whether he sees a bubble in the AI industry, Cruz was circumspect.\n\n\"Will there be uncertainty? Will there be economic challenges? Of course,\" Cruz told Business Insider. \"But for technology of this magnitude, it's in our interest that America win the race, and not China.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez argued that there's a connection between the potential bubble and financial incentives to make AI technology more exploitative.\n\n\"People's deepest fears, secrets, emotional content, relationships can all be mined for this empty promise that we're getting from these companies to turn a profit,\" Ocasio-Cortez said at the November hearing.\n\nOther lawmakers have also raised concerns. In November, Democratic Rep. Bill Foster of Illinois led a group of 21 lawmakers on a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asking his agency to evaluate the risks of AI investment in light of concerns about a bubble.\n\nBut for some of those who want to see stronger regulation of AI, the question of a bubble is largely beside the point.\n\n\"Bubble, no bubble, whatever,\" Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said. \"We need to focus on the effect on working people.\"",

    "fullText": "The must-read story in the $5 trillion hedge fund industry used to be about who made the biggest trade or launched the biggest fund. Now it's about who made the biggest hire or got the biggest guaranteed payout.\n\nAs the increasingly institutional space has veered away from star funds run by a single genius to sprawling investment platforms with dozens of investing teams, the industry has grappled with a shortage of talent.\n\nIt's now such a finite resource that top portfolio managers are commanding deals that resemble those of professional athletes, and top managers accustomed to poaching their choice of talent by paying top dollar are now developing more talent in-house to cut expenses.\n\nBusiness Insider has closely covered the evolution of hedge funds. See our stories below on the state of play, how the industry is changing, and who the new stars are as a result.\n\nThe numbers are staggering, with guaranteed nine-figure payouts and yearslong non-compete clauses, but the anecdotes of what it's like inside the biggest funds are just as startling.\n\nBig-name funds churn through underperformers, giving PMs \"moment-by-moment paranoia,\" according to one former investor. Firms dangle potential relocation to tax havens like Puerto Rico and Dubai to entice top traders. Recruiters are being pushed into ethical gray areas to determine the truth about potential hires.\n\nWhenever this much money is flowing, there's bound to be ripple effects. Within hedge funds, this means the introduction of both new industry players and new roles within the largest firms.\n\nAs with any gold rush, people are picking up an ax in the hopes of carving out a little piece for themselves. It's up to the powers-that-be of the industry to decide what's real and what's fool's gold.\n\nOne subset of the industry that has been thrust into the spotlight during the talent is the individuals who find top PMs.\n\nRecruiters and business development professionals at the industry's biggest managers have seen their own worth soar in recent years. With a steady flow of fresh capital into hedge funds, this cohort is likely to remain in demand for years to come.",

    "fullText": "Walmart is trying to transform itself from America's grocery store into a global tech titan and is reshaping its workforce in the process.\n\nThe 63-year-old company has been the largest retailer in the world for decades and has held the top spot on the Fortune 500 list since 2013. But it has also invested heavily over the past several years in becoming a powerhouse of e-commerce and retail media.\n\nSalary data shows how serious Walmart is about competing with the likes of Amazon, Facebook, and Google for talent to beef up its tech.\n\nCompany filings with the US Labor Department show Walmart sought to hire more than 4,000 workers through the US H-1B visa program in the most recent reporting year, which ended September 30. Those workers were largely in software development, business intelligence, and IT. That number is up slightly from about 3,800 for the same period a year before.\n\nThis publicly available work visa data — which companies are required to disclose to the government — refers only to foreign hires and doesn't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay.\n\nIn addition to base salary, a Walmart spokesperson said that the company's compensation packages include bonus opportunities and stock awards and that the company invests in employees' career growth.\n\nStill, the reported pay rates are benchmarked against industry standards for US workers. That can shed light on how much Walmart employees earn in specific roles and where the company is looking to expand.\n\nAt the same time, the process for obtaining an H-1B visa is changing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump instituted a new $100,000 fee for the visa in September, and other proposed changes to H-1B visa rules would tilt the program in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nOther employers, including Amazon, submit work visa data, and Walmart's salaries are largely in line with those for similar roles at the e-commerce giant.\n\nAny changes to the H-1B visa program could have a significant impact on Walmart's workforce strategy.\n\nThe retail giant boasts a global workforce of 2.1 million people, of whom about 1.6 million are in the US, making it the largest private employer in both cases.\n\nMost of the company's open positions as of December were for jobs in Walmart stores and Sam's Club warehouses, while about 650 openings were for technology roles.\n\nThe company has been expanding in tech, hiring in July a new executive vice president of AI acceleration, product, and design who reports directly to the CEO, and recruiting for an EVP of AI platforms.\n\nMost of Walmart's white-collar jobs are based either in its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters or in one of the company's satellite offices in the Bay Area. According to the H-1B data, about half of the positions are in Bentonville, while a third are in California, and most of the remainder are assigned to sites in Texas, New Jersey, Washington, and Virginia.\n\nHere's a deeper look at some of the roles and their annual base salaries:\n\nQuality engineer III: $64,730 to $117,000\n\nSoftware engineer III: $99,052 to $234,000\n\nSenior software engineer: $100,294 to $234,000\n\nStaff software engineer: $127,292 to $286,000\n\nPrincipal software engineer: $149,607 to $286,000\n\nSenior product manager: $121,000 to $234,000\n\nStaff product manager: $136,500 to $286,000\n\nPrincipal product manager: $166,962 to $286,000\n\nData scientist III: $98,800 to $234,000\n\nSenior data scientist: $124,176 to $234,000\n\nStaff data scientist: $138,333 to $338,000\n\nPrincipal data scientist: $158,642 to $286,000\n\nSenior design researcher: $142,002 to $234,000\n\nSenior UX designer: $111,000 to $234,000\n\nSenior manager, UX design: $183,227 to $286,000\n\nDirector, software engineering: $177,154 to $338,000\n\nDirector, data science: $169,000 to $338,000\n\nDirector, product management: $174,300 to $338,000\n\nSenior director, product management: $208,000 to $416,000\n\nGroup director, product management — international: $254,000 to $481,000",

    "description": "The US is once again teetering into an economy where high earners keep things afloat, and lower earners see cooling prospects.",
    "fullText": "The post-pandemic era marked by growing wages and opportunities for lower-income Americans has flipped around.\n\nThe K-shaped economy is back, and it could mean more trouble in 2026.\n\nFor higher earners, economic outcomes and opportunities are chugging along, albeit perhaps a bit muted than during the boom labor market of a few years ago. For those at the bottom, in lower-earning positions that are traditionally more sensitive to downturns, things are looking worse.\n\nIt might also spell rocky times ahead for an economy that's largely being propped up by the spending and opportunities of those at the top.\n\nThe return to a K-shaped economy has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve and its voting members. In minutes from the December Fed meeting, a majority of participants \"mentioned evidence of stronger spending growth for higher-income households,\" while lower-earning households were becoming \"increasingly price sensitive\" and adjusting their spending in response to price increases for essentials.\n\nAt a December press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he's not sure how long this can last. \"Most of the consumption does happen by people who have more means,\" Powell said. \"I think the top third accounts for way more than a third of the consumption, for example. So, it's a good question how sustainable that is.\"\n\nThe \"K\" has been slowly shaping up over the last couple of years, and has accelerated in the last few months: A Bank of America Institute report showed that the growth in credit and debit card spending among lower-income and higher-income households split into a K shape around this past spring, with higher-income households experiencing spending growth near 3% year-over-year in late 2025, compared to less than 1% growth for the lower-income households.\n\n\"While the 'K shape' continues, it will likely, in our view, gather additional focus in 2026,\" the authors wrote.\n\nOn the income side, those at the bottom are doing worse than those at the top. The Atlanta Fed wage growth tracker showed that growth for the highest quartile of the wage distribution surpassed that of the lowest quartile in October 2024 and has remained consistently higher since then. Wage growth for the lowest quartile skyrocketed back in 2022, reaching the highest point on record in the fall after the gap between the two quartiles widened to the highest point in July.\n\n\"People who are putting a lot more of their income toward essential expenses are feeling burdened by that at a much greater capacity than people who have much higher incomes at the same time, unlike during that post-pandemic environment,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, said.\n\nAnd while wages are trending higher for the upper quartile, it doesn't necessarily mean blockbuster gains — part of the precarity of the K as inflation remains stubborn. Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, said cooler income growth has pushed many upper-median and below households to lean on savings and credit.\n\n\"A K-shaped consumer spending outlook is simply not sustainable in the long-run — eventually income pulls spending,\" Daco said in written commentary.\n\nTo be sure, some economists and analysts don't think the K-shaped economy ever really left. \"We've been in a K-shaped economy for the better part of two decades,\" Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist of RSM, said, pointing to the 2008 financial crisis as one factor kick-starting the uneven outcomes. Now, Brusuelas said, economic inequality has \"clearly deepened.\"\n\n\"There was a brief period of narrowing early in the post-pandemic era when fiscal policy was put in place to provide a substitute for lost wages and mitigate the post-recession transition of the pandemic,\" he said.\n\nAnna Paulson, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said higher-income households have been able to \"spend freely,\" benefiting from the ongoing robust stock market. The wealthiest 1% of Americans hold nearly half of the country's corporate equities and mutual funds, data from the Federal Reserve's Distributional Financial Accounts showed.\n\n\"So, while headline growth is shaping up to be pretty decent this year, the base of support looks different — with a lot of concentration at the top,\" Paulson said.\n\nIn Brusuelas's view, the US economy is largely locked into that K-shape and would need serious policy changes to shift it, and he doesn't see that as likely happening in 2026.\n\n\"When I take a look at the policy landscape, it's all tilted toward the upper spur of the K,\" Brusuelas said. \"So I'm expecting a further widening of that fundamental inequality in coming years.\"\n\nHow is the economy affecting you?

    "title": "I'm a Google engineer who thought I wasn't qualified for an AI role. One thing helped me transform my career.",
    "description": "Emrick Donadei said participating in a hackathon gave him hands-on experience and expanded his network at Google.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Emrick Donadei, a 32-year-old software engineer at Google, based in New York. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started at Google a few years ago, my role was completely unrelated to AI.\n\nWhen ChatGPT came out, Google started to focus more on LLMs and opened up more opportunities in the company to switch roles. Similar to others, I became more interested in exploring area.\n\nA few months ago, I switched to an AI role. Now I'm a software engineer working on AI safety. Fundamentally, it's similar to my last role, but instead of building software, I'm building LLMs, which requires data, training, and compute.\n\nInitially, I didn't think I could get a role working in AI. I didn't have the right credentials and when I spoke with other teams, I felt a disconnect because I hadn't even touched the products, let alone experimented with creating them.\n\nI was able to transition because I was at the right company at a time when demand was high — but also because I decided to participate in a hackathon. I think hackathons are the best way for everybody to get into AI.\n\nI'm completely switching my career and that's all because the hackathon forced me to get my foot in the door.\n\nI participated in hackathons orchestrated by Amazon in 2018 and 2019, which I won, and I grew a lot from it. When I saw an opportunity to compete with some of the most brilliant minds in the industry on the hottest topic in the industry, it felt like the perfect mix to both learn a lot and possibly redefine my career.\n\nI participated in Google's annual employee-only hackathon in 2024, which lasted seven days. During that time, I worked to create a new product and then do a demo of it at the end. I learned how to use the tools and started to understand the bottlenecks and gaps. It also taught me to understand more about the fundamental knowledge of AI, like how to build infrastructure for LLMs, how to create the algorithms to create agentic workflows — the things that are less sexy.\n\nI didn't do anything revolutionary. I built a small prototype that wasn't super useful — but it was a good way to get started. I experimented with concepts like creating agents and fine-tuning models.\n\nThe hackathon was a really good way to show myself that I could create something that I wasn't familiar with, and I ended up doing a second one in 2025, which unlocked even more opportunities. For example, I was able to publish a public technical disclosure with Google as a follow-up to my work in the second hackathon.\n\nI saw some colleagues transition to AI teams after the hackathon, but the vast majority didn't. You can't just do a hackathon and stop there. You have to actually leverage that experience.\n\nThere are thousands of people who participate, and you have to be really good to win. So, if you're not going to win, rather than letting your idea rot, you should use the opportunity to talk about what you created.\n\nMy team members and I did a lot of self-promotion. We presented the prototype and discussed it with a lot of teams. I usually reached out to group technical leads, because they tend to have a high-level view and they'll be able to tell you quickly if your hackathon project makes sense in their unit after a 30-minute presentation. If it doesn't, they'll give you the name of someone else to try.\n\nI created a lot of connections from these one-on-one meetings with people I didn't know to talk about my product. It helped me become way more proactive, and I got some really amazing opportunities from those conversations.\n\nI also continued to upskill outside the hackathon. I learned to leverage AI as much as possible to speed up my learning. I use tools like Claude Code to read code and documentation faster, Gemini and ChatGPT Deep Research for case studies, and NotebookLM to consume a lot of information at once.\n\nI also watched Andrej Karpathy's YouTube videos and run a podcast with a friend for software engineers and AI enthusiasts. We're doing it mostly because it's the most proactive way for us to keep learning.",

    "fullText": "The Scottish Premiership takes its first strides into 2026 on Saturday, with all 12 teams in action.\n\nHere are the names and games to watch out for...\n\nThe meeting of Glasgow's top two usually tops the bill on the Scottish fixture card but Saturday's meeting at Celtic Park holds particular intrigue.\n\nCeltic under new manager Wilfried Nancy have lost five of their past seven games, three of which have come in the league.\n\nThat has taken the defending Premiership champions to five losses in the division at their halfway point.\n\nThe French boss leads his team for the first time against Rangers, who trail Celtic by three points.\n\nRangers, under Danny Rohl, have won eight and drawn two in the league - with the Ibrox side's early season draws under Russell Martin meaning there is still a gap to Celtic and a six-point distance to leaders Hearts.\n\nThe German has led his relatively new team once against Celtic, losing to Martin O'Neill's side 3-1 in extra time in November's Premier Sports Cup semi-final.\n\nWhat makes Saturday's encounter particularly pressing is both teams' need to stay as close to Hearts as possible. Any points dropped would allow Derek McInnes' team the chance to open up a more handsome advantage.\n\nAnd let's not forget Motherwell and Hibernian, both within touching distance of the Glasgow duo, albeit having played a game more.\n\nDerby day also beckons at Tannadice too.\n\nDundee and Dundee United meet for the second time this season, with United having won their maiden encounter this campaign.\n\nFor the visitors, it is the chance to record three wins on the bounce for the first time this season.\n\nSuccessive victories were achieved with Ashley Hay and Charlie Reilly netting their first goals for the club at home to Kilmarnock on Tuesday evening. That 2-1 win moved the Dark Blues up to ninth.\n\nReilly's winner, which followed an assist for the equaliser, was a particularly stylish finish as the forward showed a glimpse of the 24-goal campaign with Albion Rovers that brought him to Dundee's attention in season 2022-23.\n\nInjuries have hampered Reilly's progress and he admitted Tuesday had been \"a long time coming\".\n\nFinding the net against United would only further endear him to the Dundee faithful.\n\nDerek McInnes has tasted defeat three times as Hearts manager, twice in the Scottish Premiership.\n\nThe most recent of those came in their last game, the 3-2 loss at the home of Edinburgh rivals Hibernian.\n\nIt very nearly ended as a draw, despite Hearts trailing 3-0 at one stage.\n\nHearts are back at home on Saturday against struggling bottom side Livingston.\n\nMcInnes has recruited right-back Jordi Altena and the Dutchman may make his debut against Livi.\n\nThe benefit the Hearts boss has had all season is a large and adaptable squad and Livingston head to Tynecastle about to face a wounded animal.\n\nWhen Hearts lost at Aberdeen in November, they followed it up with two draws before getting back to winning ways.\n\nMcInnes will be determined to avoid any more slip-ups.\n\nRangers consider move for Motherwell's Watt - gossip\n\nFrom Taylor Swift to football nirvana - Motherwell's long road to Celtic demolition",

    "fullText": "Scottish Premiership: Celtic v Rangers\n\nVenue: Celtic Park, Glasgow Date: Saturday, 3 January Time: 12:30 GMT\n\nCoverage: Listen on BBC Radio Scotland & Sounds, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app, highlights on BBC Scotland & iPlayer from 19:15\n\nRangers are working around the clock to recruit players in the January transfer window, says head coach Danny Rohl.\n\nRohl was appointed in October so this winter window is the German's first opportunity to make changes to his squad.\n\n\"We are working 24/7 for players,\" he said. \"It's about decision making, it's about negotiations, it's about timing. We have some players in our mind but you have to be a little bit patient.\n\n\"You always hope as a manager to get the players in very early.\n\n\"In January you have to be patient, but you have to be demanding. You have to take the opportunities and there are opportunities in the market.\"\n\nRohl hinted that left-back is an area of interest, with Jayden Meghoma the only left-sided full-back in his squad whereas there are three right-sided options in Max Aarons, Dujon Sterling and captain James Tavernier.\n\nFormer Heart of Midlothian left-back James Penrice, 27, is one name already linked with Rangers, the Scot having joined AEK Athens in July.\n\n\"On the right side, I have good options,\" explained Rohl before Saturday's Scottish Premiership meeting with Celtic.\n\n\"Jayden at the moment is very solid, especially the defensice side, I like how he has improved.\n\n\"Sometimes I played Max on the left, so it could be an area that we are looking for to improve.\"\n\nRangers consider move for Motherwell's Watt - gossip\n\n'Rangers right in mix' - can they now go level with Celtic?\n\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nRohl's only taste of the Old Firm derby was November's 3-1 Premier Sports Cup defeat by interim manager Martin O'Neill's Celtic at Hampden, which went to extra time.\n\nRangers trail second-placed Celtic by three points while Wilfried Nancy's side are three points behind leaders Hearts.\n\n\"We are ready,\" said Rohl. \"We have a big confidence at the moment, we have a big belief.\n\n\"We need a good start in the game. It will be an emotional game from both teams. I can nearly go with my best XI. This is a good feeling for me.\n\n\"Football's about the small details, it's about the momentum during the game and we have to try to get the momentum quickly on our side.\n\n\"The idea is how we can break our opponents but it's also about how aggressive we are in the duels. I want to see a brave team. You have to defend really well around your own box.\"\n\nThe German says winning the derby for the first time \"would be amazing\".\n\n\"For this we need a big, big performance,\" he added.\n\n\"It's just three points - but this game is never about just three points. There is an emotional side.\n\n\"If we are right there, we are front foot and we can win some good balls and we hurt them, then they will be more nervous - but if they create some good moments in the beginning then I think the crowd will be behind them.\"",

    "fullText": "Ole Miss vs. Miami predictions: Expert picks and odds for 2025 CFP semifinal at Fiesta Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNo. 6 Ole Miss will meet No. 10 Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Thursday, Jan. 8.\n\nKickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPN.\n\nOle Miss (13-1) stunned No. 3 Georgia 39-34 in the Allstate Sugar Bowl behind an incredible effort from quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, who led a second-half comeback with 362 passing yards and two TDs. Pete Golding – who replaced Lane Kiffin after the coach left for LSU – has a chance to lead the Rebels to the CFP championship game for the first time in school history.\n\nMiami (12-2) made a program statement with a 24-14 victory against No. 2 Ohio State in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic. Beck averages 120.5 passing yards with two TDs and no interceptions in two playoff games. Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor have led a nasty defense that has allowed 8.5 points through two playoff games. Mario Cristobal has a chance to push the Hurricanes to their first national championship game since 2003 – which was also at the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nMORE: Hurricane Bane is a Category 5 for Miami\n\nHere is an early look at the betting odds and our pick for the winner of the Fiesta Bowl. Odds courtesy of Caesars:\n\nMoneyline: Miami -160, Ole Miss +135\n\nOle Miss is 1-1 ATS as an underdog this season, and both games were against Georgia. The Rebels were 5-1 S/U in games with a spread of seven points or less. The Hurricanes are 2-0 S/U and 2-0 ATS when favored by seven points or less.\n\nMiami's pass rush wrecked the Ohio State game plan in the CFP quarterfinals. Bain has four of the Hurricanes' 12 sacks in the playoff. Mesidor has three sacks in those two games, and they have combined for 26 pressures.\n\nChambliss, however, presents a different challenge with his escapability outside the pocket. That pass rush will have to land, and Chambliss made Georgia pay with receivers Harrison Wallace III and De'Zhaun Stribling. How many risks will Chambliss take against a Miami secondary that features Bryce Fitzgerald (6 INTs), Jakobe Thomas (5 INTs) and Keionte Scott (2 INTs), who had the game-turning pick six against the Buckeyes?\n\nThe other piece is Kewan Lacy, a tough running back who has played through a shoulder injury the last two games. The Rebels are a different challenge for Miami defensive coordinator Corey Hetherman.\n\nMiami will attack Georgia with Mark Fletcher Jr., a tough inside runner who will try to attack the middle with defensive tackles Zxavian Harris and Will Echoles. Sunatrine Perkins and Princewell Umanmielen add to that pass rush. Malachi Toney and CJ Daniels will challenge the Ole Miss secondary in the intermediate passing game.\n\nHow will Beck handle the opportunity to get to the CFP championship game? Beck has thrown just one interception since the 26-20 loss to SMU on Nov. 1, and he has great protection from an offensive line led by Francis Mauigoa.\n\nMiami has not allowed more than 26 points in a game this season – but they have not faced a quarterback like Chambliss either. That is where this matchup will be decided. He passed for 300 or more yards in four of Ole Miss' last five games, and the Rebels are riding the same momentum wave as the Hurricanes. This makes for an almost impossible choice.\n\nSN AWARDS: 2025 All-America team | Player of the Year | Coach of the Year\n\nWhere Texas Tech-Oregon ranks among low-scoring CFP games\n\nYep, Arch Manning leads the 2026 Heisman race\n\nRanking top QBs in transfer portal",

    "fullText": "Giants legend Eli Manning shares video of hilarious hoverboard fail appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe New York Giants flopped in 2025, and their greatest quarterback of all-time did the same to begin 2026. Eli Manning posted a video of himself riding a hoverboard on New Year’s Day, refusing to hide from his mistakes. He fell backwards in the water, but the two-time Super Bowl MVP is in high spirits following his thrilling experience.\n\n“Who says you can’t teach an old dog new tricks?” he remarked on X. “Happy New Year!” Manning seems to be having much more fun than his beloved Giants, as they take a 3-13 record into the final week of the regular season. The good news is they will have plenty of time for hoverboarding or any outdoor activity of their choice.\n\nWho says you can’t teach an old dog new tricks? Happy New Year! pic.twitter.com/crGzBVhJb0\n\n— Eli Manning (@EliManning) January 1, 2026\n\nThe Giants legend is probably gaining even more pleasure from this holiday excursion in light of the recent news. Manning is once again in the running for Hall of Fame enshrinement. He is one of 15 finalists who will have a chance to be inducted into Cooperstown next summer. It is probably good for him to have a healthy distraction.\n\nThough, whether he is agonizing over his Hall of Fame case, watching Big Blue play or picking up a new hobby, the result appears to be the same. Pain.\n\nEli Manning is surely proud of fellow Ole Miss alum Jaxson Dart, however. He underwent some intense growing pains in his rookie 2004-05 season, averaging just 115.9 passing yards per game and throwing six touchdowns to nine interceptions. Ultimately, the second-generation talent persevered and went on to complete two of the most iconic passes in NFL history. Perhaps he can give some inspiration to Dart in the offseason.\n\nManning can also take his own advice, as he tries to conquer the hoverboard.",

    "fullText": "NEW ORLEANS − Ole Miss football is still playing in the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe Rebels beat Georgia 39-34 in the Sugar Bowl. Ole Miss won on a 47-yard field goal kick from Lucas Carneiro with nine seconds remaining. Ole Miss added a safety\n\nWith the win, Ole Miss (13-1) advances to the semifinals of the CFP. Georgia (12-2) is eliminated. Ole Miss will face No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 8.\n\nThe Rebels will be the higher-seeded team in the Fiesta Bowl and look poised to continue their run. Ole Miss won through its stars.\n\nQuarterback Trinidad Chambliss was remarkable. He was 30-for-46 for 362 yards and two touchdowns. Chambliss evaded Georgia pass rushers (zero sacks) and threw no interceptions.\n\nRunning back Kewan Lacy was elite. He bounced back from an early fumble and rushed for 98 yards on 22 carries. He had two scores.\n\nIf Ole Miss gets that level of production, it has the capability to beat Miami, No. 1 Indiana or No. 5 Oregon.\n\nThere was pressure on Ole Miss coach Pete Golding entering the CFP.\n\nIf the Rebels were beaten by Tulane at home in the first round of the CFP, it would be a quick, disappointing end to Golding's first chance as a head coach. The same thing applies if Ole Miss was embarassed in the second round against Georgia.\n\nNeither happened. Ole Miss crushed Tulane 45-10 and bounced the SEC champions. It's given the post-Lane Kiffin era tremendous momentum.\n\nA pair of drops from Ole Miss pass catchers had a noticable impact.\n\nTight end Dae'Quan Wright dropped a ball on third-and-3 with two minutes remaining in the first half. Ole Miss punted on the next play.\n\nThe second came with 18 seconds remaining in the first half. The Rebels were driving in an attempt to get into field goal position when receiver Harrison Wallace dropped a pass at the UGA 28-yard line. Two plays later, time expired in the half just before the Rebels could attempt a kick.\n\nThe game sounded more like an Ole Miss home game than a neutral site bowl game.\n\nOle Miss fans packed the east side of the Caesars Superdome. Georgia fans were certainly noticeable on the west side but most of the seats on both end zones were occupied by those wearing powder blue.\n\nSam Hutchens covers Ole Miss for the Clarion Ledger.

    "fullText": "In a Sugar Bowl classic between two SEC teams fighting for a spot in the College Football Playoff semifinals, one of the biggest winners was in Baton Rouge. Financially, at least.\n\nLane Kiffin, the former Ole Miss coach who left the program last month for LSU, will receive a $500,000 bonus from his new employer thanks to his former team reaching the CFP semifinal via a thrilling 39-34 win over Georgia. The bonus is part of an agreement LSU reached with the coach to lure him from Oxford, offering him the same bonuses he would have received for each CFP victory had he stayed at Ole Miss.\n\nKiffin had already received a $250,000 bonus after the Rebels defeated Tulane in the first round. If they defeat No. 10 Miami in the next round, Kiffin will add another $750,000 to his tally.\n\nAnd if they were to win one more for the program’s first title in decades? One of the most bittersweet $1 million payments in the history of sports.\n\nPete Golding, the defensive coordinator who stayed at Ole Miss to take over as head coach, will receive the same bonuses. On his way out, Kiffin insisted on staying to coach the Rebels in the playoff, but the school understandably didn’t want a coach of another SEC team to be running its program during a key part of recruiting season.\n\nIt was an open question whether Kiffin would show up in New Orleans on Thursday to watch his former players and coaches face Georgia, but he decided to stick with his current school instead. He made an appearance on the court at the LSU women’s basketball team’s game, embracing head coach Kim Mulkey.\n\nNo. 5-ranked LSU took its first loss of the season, falling 80-78 to No. 11 Kentucky. After the game, it appears Kiffin did make it to New Orleans, or at least his family did.\n\nWhat a great finish!!! So much fun!! Only two more to go ⁦@OleMissFB⁩ 🇹🇹 🪄 🏆 #BTA pic.twitter.com/axTTTHP5pO\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) January 2, 2026\n\nMeanwhile, Ole Miss fans were making their thoughts about the man their team was enriching very clear, with a “F*** Lane Kiffin” chant at the end of the game. The state’s governor had a similar outlook.\n\n— Governor Tate Reeves (@tatereeves) January 2, 2026\n\nThis was a situation that was surreal from the moment Kiffin started taking other schools’ calls, and it won’t get any better with Ole Miss have a very real chance at the CFP championship game.",

    "fullText": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Trinidad Chambliss passed for 362 yards and two touchdowns, and Lucas Carneiro kicked his third field goal of the game with 6 seconds left to put No. 6 Mississippi in front for good in a 39-34 victory over third-ranked Georgia in a College Football Playoff in the Sugar Bowl on Thursday night.\n\nIn an unusual twist, the Ole Miss was awarded a safety on its final kickoff when Georgia’s return team tried a cross-field lateral that hit the pylon.\n\nGeorgia then recovered an onside kick and ran one more play in which they executed numerous laterals before the play fizzled, sending Ole Miss (13-1, CFP No. 6 seed) on to a semifinal against Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nKicking off on the heels of two lopsided CFP quarterfinals at the Orange and Rose bowls, the Sugar Bowl provided drama until the end.\n\nAfter seeing a 21-12 halftime lead turn into a 34-24 deficit with 9:02 to play, Georgia (12-2, CFP No. 3 seed) then rallied to tie it, first driving for Gunner Stockton’s 18-yard TD pass to Zachariah Branch before Peyton Woodring’s short field goal tied it with 55 seconds left in regulation.\n\nChambliss responded by setting up the winning kick with a 40-yard pass to De’Zhaun Stribling on third down from Mississippi’s own 30-yard line. A few plays later, Carneiro, who’d already broken Sugar Bowl records with field goals of 55 and 56 yards, hit from 47 and sprinted triumphantly toward the Ole Miss sideline as the Rebels (13-1, CFP No. 6 seed) jubilantly swarmed around him.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLane Kiffin keeps getting paid by Ole Miss — even after leaving Oxford.\n\nWith Ole Miss’ 39-34 win over Georgia in Thursday night’s Sugar Bowl, Lane Kiffin earned a $500,000 bonus tied to his former contract with the Rebels, according to terms previously outlined in his deal. The payout comes despite Kiffin no longer coaching the team after his high-profile departure for LSU on Nov. 30.\n\nPer the structure of Kiffin’s Ole Miss contract, postseason bonuses were triggered by College Football Playoff advancement. Those incentives were absorbed by LSU as part of Kiffin’s exit agreement.\n\nKiffin had already earned $150,000 when the Ole Miss Rebels secured a spot in the 12-team CFP field. That figure increased to $250,000 following a first-round victory over Tulane. The Sugar Bowl win over the Georgia Bulldogs pushed the total to $500,000 after the Rebels advanced to the semifinals.\n\nThe bonus escalators remain in place. If Ole Miss reaches the national championship game, Kiffin’s total bonus would climb to $750,000. A national title would raise it to $1 million. Ironically, Kiffin was not on the sideline for the Sugar Bowl victory. He was spending the evening watching LSU women’s basketball.\n\nPete Golding, who took over as Ole Miss’ full-time head coach following Kiffin’s exit, guided the Rebels through the quarterfinal win and is eligible to receive the same bonuses directly from the school based on postseason results.\n\nKiffin’s departure triggered significant coaching-carousel movement across college football in November, with several vacancies filling rapidly after his decision became official.\n\nOle Miss will face the Miami Hurricanes in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 8.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrinidad Chambliss started last season at Division II Ferris State and started this season on the bench, but he is at the center of the college football world after a Sugar Bowl win over Georgia.\n\nFaced with a two-possession deficit in the second half, largely the result of his own team's mistakes, Chambliss caught fire down the stretch on Thursday night and led Ole Miss to the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 39-34 upset victory.\n\nChambliss impressed with his legs and his arm in the second half, extending plays and leading a pair of high-tempo touchdown drives in the fourth quarter to take control of a game the Rebels weren't supposed to win. When Ole Miss lost that control, Chambliss made the throw that set up a game-winning field goal.\n\nHere's a closer look at Chambliss' performance against Georgia and his top moments from the win.\n\nMORE:How missed facemask penalty nearly changed Sugar Bowl outcome\n\nChambliss finished 30-of-46 for 362 yards and two touchdowns in the win over Georgia, adding 14 rushing yards in the biggest win in Ole Miss history.\n\nChambliss broke a record for consecutive completions in the Sugar Bowl, previously held by Tim Tebow and Michael Penix Jr., and he didn't blink after falling behind by multiple possessions even as mistakes around him threatened to bury the Rebels.\n\nThe win marked a new season-high in passing yards for Chambliss, narrowly surpassing a 359-yard performance against Mississippi State in the regular season finale, and it marked his fifth game with multiple touchdown passes and no interceptions.\n\nHere's a look at some of the biggest plays Chambliss made, including a wild escape job for a first down and a critical completion that set up a game-winning field goal.\n\nMORE: How Trinidad Chambliss went from D2 afterthought to SEC star\n\nSomehow, Chambliss kept this play alive and got the ball to Kewan Lacy for a first down despite being chased back to his own one-yard line.\n\nTrinidad Chambliss and Kewan Lacy keep the drive alive, and Ole Miss takes a three-point lead in Q4 🤯\n\n🎥 @espnpic.twitter.com/0UXcQqnFPN\n\n— The Athletic (@TheAthletic) January 2, 2026\n\nChambliss found Harrison Wallace III on the run for this huge gain:\n\ntrinidad chambliss to harrison wallace; ole miss vs georgia pic.twitter.com/LcPUwESpEX\n\n— ◇ (@F0RGIAT0) January 2, 2026\n\nChambliss knew exactly when to get rid of the ball on this play:\n\nCHAMBLISS OUT HERE PLAYING MADDEN OH MY GOD🤯\npic.twitter.com/IZB3hWaasw\n\n— JUGGABETS (@mykezaa) January 2, 2026\n\nChambliss threw a dart to De'Zhaun Stribling for 40 yards and the chance to win the game on a field goal on Ole Miss' final drive.\n\nCHAMBLISS TO STRIBLING\n\nPOTENTIALLY THE DAGGER pic.twitter.com/4vAwRizyzZ\n\n— Grant (@grantsglimpse) January 2, 2026\n\nChambliss turned 23 in August, days before the start of the season.\n\nA former star at Division II Ferris State, Chambliss opened the 2025 season as a backup to starter Austin Simmons but took over after an injury to Simmons and made it impossible for Lane Kiffin to give the job back to the Week 1 starter.\n\nNow, Chambliss is anticipating an NCAA decision on his eligibility after he filed a waiver to play in 2026. Whether he would stay in Oxford or test the transfer portal waters isn't clear, but the NFL Draft could also be an option as he builds his value in the College Football Playoff.\n\nMORE:Explaining Trinidad Chambliss' upcoming waiver decision\n\nChambliss attended Forest Hills Northern in Grand Rapids, Michigan, before committing to nearby Ferris State.\n\nAfter winning two titles at the Division II level, Chambliss transferred to Ole Miss and opened this season as a backup after Austin Simmons was named the Week 1 starter by Lane Kiffin.\n\nMORE: How Trinidad Chambliss went from D2 afterthought to SEC star\n\nThe decision for Chambliss, if his waiver is approved, was believed to be between staying at Ole Miss and transferring to LSU or elsewhere. Now, the NFL could be in play given his impressive College Football Playoff run.\n\nESPN's Mel Kiper ranked Chambliss as his No. 6 quarterback in the 2026 class in mid-December, which might slot him as a mid-round pick in a fairly thin class for the position, but the lack of blue-chip prospects in the class could be why it makes the most sense for the Ole Miss star to turn professional now.\n\nOnce the Rebels' run is over, Chambliss could see his stock elevated closer to the top quarterback prospects in the draft than anyone could have imagined.",

He finished 30-of-46 passes for 362 yards and two touchdown passes.\n\nThe Rebels' five-point win over the Bulldogs served to be the closest game of the CFP quarterfinals, and the closest game of the 2025-26 College Football Playoff.

    "fullText": "Ever since Ruben Amorim took charge, Manchester United have ditched their traditional method of attacking with wingers, instead choosing to employ wingbacks.\n\nAmad, who was signed as a winger, was repurposed to fit this idea, and the Ivorian has made the right wingback position his own.\n\nHowever, it is the opposite flank where the head coach has struggled to find the right fit. Diogo Dalot has been the go-to option, but he is a traditional fullback and has struggled with the attacking part.\n\nPatrick Dorgu was signed from Lecce to play in that position, but he has been hit-or-miss and needs more time.\n\nWith the Red Devils struggling for any real consistency, the Portuguese tactician could do with help in the January window to address this issues.\n\nWhile a midfielder remains the top priority, The Daily Mail have claimed the club have discussed the possibility of adding a wingback to their armoury as well.\n\nIn fact, INEOS are reportedly planning to reunite the former Sporting CP boss with one of his former club’s best academy products in Salvador Blopa.\n\n“United have discussed Sporting Lisbon right wing back Salvador Blopa,” the report claimed.\n\nLabelled the “next Nuno Mendes“, the 18-year-old set tongues wagging after he set an 88-year club record on his debut with the Sporting senior team last season.\n\nHe became the first player for the club to score two goals on his debut since 1937. The academy product can play on either flank and interestingly, his current deal expires in the summer.\n\nSporting have been trying to agree a new long-term deal with the player’s representatives, which will include a mammoth €100 million release clause.\n\nIt is expected to act as a deterrent, but until that is agreed, the 20-time English league champions have the chance to pounce and potentially seal the signature of Salvador Blopa on a free.\n\nFeature image Alex Livesey via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Indiana’s head coach addressed the media after a dominant win over Alabama in the Rose Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Indiana football head coach Curt Cignetti addressed the media following the No. 1-seed Hoosiers’ 38-3 win over No. 9-seed Alabama at the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California.\n\nHere’s what he had to say, courtesy of ASAPSports:\n\nQ. You had mentioned yesterday that you felt like the preparation was really going that great or you were — it would probably bring up concern for people in that situation. What changed from that point to now to where it didn’t look like there was really much of a layoff that you guys were on?\n\nCIGNETTI: Sometimes my messaging is intended for the players to hear to further reinforce my message to them, because preparation’s hard to gauge. Alabama had to do the same thing we did, come out on a Wednesday and then have their first practice on site, and I mean, there is disruption there compared to your normal routine, which we’re all creatures of a routine.\n\nSo I think our guys — we had a great walk-through yesterday. We went to SoFi for that, and that was great for our players, I think, to get there.\n\nI thought our mindset was really good. I liked our prep, for the most part, once we knew who the opponent was. It was a hard-fought game early in the game. Alabama made some plays, they had us off balance offensively, they had a new all-up blitz.\n\nBut we were able to kind of make the plays when we needed to and take it over in the second half. And you know it’s a great win for our football program. I’m proud of our players, our coaches, and everyone. Again, a big win against a team that’s got great tradition like that and history, a lot of good players, and great head football coach.\n\nQ. Felt like another kind of one of those games you’ve had this season where your run game just kind of grounded them down. As the game worn on and you popped explosives in the second half. What does it say about the offense and maybe specifically that ground game, the way it can lean on an opponent as a game wears on and maybe really tire a defense out?\n\nCIGNETTI: I think that’s what you would always love to see as the head coach, things we used to preach when I was at Alabama, about changing the way they think, breaking their will, and that’s the best way to do it, running the football.\n\nIt takes a while. It doesn’t happen in the first quarter, the second quarter, it happens in the second half at some point, hopefully, when you’re able to achieve that goal.\n\nAnd I thought our line did a nice job. I thought our backs really ran hard, and I’m sure there were some nice blocks down field too, but the backs, I was really impressed with how hard they ran.\n\nQ. When your offensive lineman wins the MVP and your Heisman quarterback is grinning from ear to ear, what does that mean to you, and how does that describe the chemistry on this team?\n\nCIGNETTI: Yeah, I think you hit it right on the head. I’m, at this point, probably used to it. Fernando’s a very special guy. He’s very unique. He’s selfless. He’s the ultimate team guy. And then we’ve got some other guys, like Coogan, who is really the same way; he’s the ultimate team guy.\n\nWe’ve got a lot of other guys on the team that played last year, like Fisher, Carter Smith, just to name two. I could name a lot more that are ultimate team guys. I think that’s one of the reasons that we’re so consistent and efficient. We are efficient, is how I would label us, is because we have good players with very high character. They’re great team guys and really good leaders, and they listen and they buy in.\n\nQ. Bryant Haines talks about how you’ve always been the same guy in the way you run your program, the way you operate. What does it mean to you to take the system that you started at the D-II level to this level of college football and have success like you did at that lower level?\n\nCIGNETTI: You know, I learned from my mistakes, one thing about it was I did make a lot of mistakes year one, and then the second time through, you always get a little better, and every year you do. So I can’t say that I’m the same coach I was year one, because I’m not. You’re always looking to improve because you get better or worse; you never stay the same.\n\nThe things they’ve talked about, the constant striving for improvement, I mean, I do try to live that way. You’re either getting better or worse; you’re separating or somebody is gaining on you.\n\nMy journey has been kind of surreal, but I think every move kind of prepared me for this challenge at this time with the changing dynamic of college football.\n\nQ. You’ve been in big games this season. How do you temper a win like this? And what does a win like this teach these young men for life after football?\n\nCIGNETTI: Well, I’m not going to assume anything like we bounce back from a number of big wins and we’ll be fine, because it’s a process. So we’ll have a very big challenge ahead of us next week. It’s very hard to beat a really good football team twice. There’s no doubt about that.\n\nWhat was the last part of your question?\n\nQ. What’s a win like this teach these young men about football and about life?\n\nCIGNETTI: That’s the great thing about football, I think. It’s a great vehicle that helps people, used properly, become more successful in their life’s work later on and raising a family. A lot of great lessons there about teamwork, leadership, overcoming adversity, meeting challenges, preparation, commitment, discipline, work ethic, toughness. We’ve got a lot of the guys that have the right stuff, and I’m proud of them.",

Ole Miss won 39-34 in the CFP quarterfinal game.\n\nBoth coaches have contract incentives tied to the Rebels' success.\n\nGolding will be paid $500,000 for the victory. If the Rebels win vs Miami in the Fiesta Bowl in the CFP semifinals, that bonus would increase to $750,000. The biggest bonus Golding could be paid is $1 million, in the event of winning the national championship.\n\nKiffin, who left Ole Miss for LSU on Nov. 30, is getting his former contract bonuses matched by LSU.

    "description": "The College Football Playoff field is down to four. Who were the winners and losers of the quarterfinals? We break down all the highs and lows.",
    "fullText": "Twelve has been trimmed to four as the College Football Playoff heads into the national semifinals with No. 1 seed Indiana set to meet No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl and No. 6 Ole Miss matched with No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nThe Hoosiers mauled No. 9 Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl behind another perfect game from Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, who finished with more touchdown passes, three, than incompletions, two.\n\nThe Rebels dug out of a 21-12 halftime deficit and won 39-34 against No. 3 Georgia, pulling away late with a 47-yard field goal with six seconds left.\n\nOregon smothered No. 4 Texas Tech 23-0 in the Orange Bowl thanks to four turnovers by the Red Raiders, including a key end-zone interception by quarterback Behren Morton in the third quarter.\n\nIn the biggest upset of this year’s tournament, Miami outmuscled No. 2 Ohio State for a 24-14 win in the Cotton Bowl, sending the defending national champions into the offseason on a two-game losing streak.\n\nBefore turning to the next round, here are the biggest winners and losers from the quarterfinals:\n\nThey’re No. 1 in the nation for a reason. But for the doubters and cynics, this destruction of mighty Alabama makes a point that’s impossible to ignore: Indiana’s not just a great story but a potential juggernaut capable of beating the absolute snot out of any team in the tournament. More aggressive than the Tide, more physical, more composed and clearly better prepared, the Hoosiers showed zero rust after a month-long break after the Big Ten championship game. Build a time machine, go back a few years or so, find your younger self and whisper this sentence in your ear: Alabama just lost the Rose Bowl to Indiana by 35 points.\n\nNow 2-0 without Lane Kiffin, the Rebels avenged their one regular-season loss thanks to a brilliant night from senior Trinidad Chambliss, who had 362 yards passing and two touchdowns without an interception. Down 21-12 at halftime, Ole Miss began to take over in the third quarter and then delivered two key scores early in the fourth. Along the way to the game-winning field goal, the Rebels had to deal with several questionable penalty calls (or lack thereof) and needed to regain their composure after Georgia tied the game with a minute to go. That Ole Miss continues to defy the odds really speaks to new coach Pete Golding’s work keeping the team together.\n\nThe image of Oregon as a finesse program persists despite ample evidence to the contrary. The latest example was the Ducks’ shutout in the Orange Bowl, which saw the defense never allow the Red Raiders to come up for air in giving up just 215 yards on 3.5 yards per play. While the running game sputtered and gained just 64 yards, Oregon quarterback Dante Moore hit on 26 of 33 attempts for 234 yards. But the defense did the dirty work in this win, including not just that end-zone pick but a previous strip-sack fumble return earlier in the third quarter that set up the Ducks’ first touchdown.\n\nThe way Miami beat Ohio State matters. Going up against a team many expected to repeat and a defense that ranked first nationally in the major categories, the Hurricanes dictated the tempo and the tone by dominating the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. That was embodied during a five-minute drive late in the fourth quarter that helped Miami bury the Buckeyes. Matchups also matter in the postseason, and Miami might’ve met a friendly opponent in Ohio State’s slower playing style. But there’s no question after the Cotton Bowl that the Hurricanes have the ability to win two more games and the program’s first national championship since 2001.\n\nAlabama hadn’t lost by 30 or more points since 1998. The Crimson Tide were so clearly the inferior team – in talent, coaching, drive, toughness – that the 35-point loss wasn’t surprising, necessarily speaking. But that doesn’t make this any less embarrassing: After fighting back from 17 points down to beat Oklahoma in the opening round, Alabama never even put up a whisper of an argument against the Hoosiers and seemed happy to shut things down early in the second half and look toward next season. This was the program’s seventh loss in two years under coach Kalen DeBoer after dropping nine games across Nick Saban’s final six seasons.\n\nThere’s a question to be asked about how good Ohio State was, really, after losing to Indiana and Miami in its final two games. Yeah, the Buckeyes beat Texas, but that was in the season opener. Their next-best win came against Michigan. The defense was terrific all year but couldn’t get key stops against Miami, especially with the game on the line. The offensive line was great until these past two games, giving up five sacks to both Indiana and Miami after just six in the first 12 games. While plenty of talent is coming back to Columbus, Ohio State has to speed things up offensively after playing too sluggishly this season.\n\nThe Bulldogs seemed on the verge of delivering a knockout blow coming out of the half after a 21-point second quarter. To give back the game at that point underlines Georgia’s unpredictability even during a 12-1 regular season, especially with an offense that was better running the ball than in 2024 but often unable to put teams away. Georgia will be haunted by a great scoring opportunity late in the game, with the Rebels up 34-31: Second-and-goal at the 3-yard line turned into fouth-and-6 and the game-tying field goal instead of the go-ahead score. To not get six points was out of character for a team that came into the Sugar Bowl ranked third in the country with a 79.3% touchdown rate in the red zone.\n\nThe Orange Bowl was a bad look for the Big 12, which joined the ACC in sending just one team into the tournament but had that team ejected right off the bat while Miami has already claimed two playoff wins. The loss also comes after a postseason where Big 12 teams had earned bowl victories against teams from the ACC, SEC and the Big Ten. This still goes down as a banner season for Texas Tech despite the ugly way things ended against Oregon, though it’s clear the Red Raiders will need to reopen the pocketbooks to compile another playoff-worthy roster next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: College Football Playoff winners, losers from quarterfinals",

The Hurricanes won their last national title after a 2001 season that was capped by a blowout win in the Rose Bowl.\n\nAfter Miami, the next most-recent national champion is No. 6 Ole Miss. The Rebels claim the 1960 national title after a 10-0-1 season that ended with a 14-6 Sugar Bowl win over Rice.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon? Neither team has a national title to its name. And one of them is guaranteed to be playing for the first in school history.\n\nHere’s a quick look at the semifinal matchups on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9.\n\nNo. 6 Ole Miss (13-1) vs. No. 10 Miami (12-2)\n\nJan. 8 | 7:30 p.m. ET | ESPN | Miami -3 | Total: 51.5\n\nThe Hurricanes have opened as the early favorites even though Ole Miss avenged a regular-season loss to Georgia in a 37-34 Sugar Bowl win over the Bulldogs.\n\nMiami took down Texas A&M in the first round and Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl on Wednesday night thanks to a relentless pass rush. Can the Hurricanes pressure Trinidad Chambliss the same way? Chambliss’ escapability was on full display against Georgia, especially in the second half. He showed how great of an improvisor he can be after Georgia’s pass rush flushed him from the pocket.\n\nThe Rebels’ win denied Miami QB Carson Beck the opportunity to play his old team for a shot at the national title. But if the betting line is to be believed, a matchup with Ole Miss gives Miami a better shot at making it to the national title game.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana (14-0) vs. No. 5 Oregon (13-1)\n\nJan. 9 | 7:30 p.m. ET | ESPN | Indiana -4 | Total: 46.5\n\nThe Hoosiers are now the clear national title favorites after a 38-3 Rose Bowl romp over Alabama. Indiana is +130 to win the national title ahead of Oregon and Miami at +300 each and Ole Miss at +600.\n\nThe Ducks shut out Texas Tech 23-0 in the Orange Bowl. It was the third shutout in CFP history and the first in nearly 10 years.\n\nIndiana beat Oregon 30-20 in the regular season. Thanks to Ole Miss’ games against Tulane and Georgia in the first two rounds, the first three rounds in this year’s playoff will have had one rematch.\n\nOregon QB Dante Moore threw two interceptions in the Ducks’ October loss as the Hoosiers held Oregon to 267 yards on 64 plays. Oregon’s win over Texas Tech was impressive but it could also have been a lot bigger. The Ducks’ offense squandered a lot of opportunities after getting into Texas Tech territory.",

According to Feinsand, the Arizona Diamondbacks and Toronto Blue Jays “may be the two most aggressive clubs in the hunt for Bregman,” although a reunion with Boston is still possible.\n\nWhere things stand with top 6 @MLB free agents https://t.co/ta8jzvhgDX\n\n— Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) January 2, 2026\n\nFeinsand adds that the Red Sox and Blue Jays are both competing for Bichette as well. Accordingly, the free-agent decisions of Bregman and Bichette are closely related.\n\nIf Bregman returns to Boston, Toronto becomes more likely to re-sign Bichette and vice versa. If Bregman joins the Blue Jays, the Red Sox may counter by signing Bichette.\n\nBoston can be flexible thanks to Marcelo Mayer’s defensive versatility. If Bregman leaves, the Red Sox could put him at third base and sign Bichette to play second base. If Bregman stays, Mayer can man second.\n\nIt depends on which of the two All-Stars signs first, and where. Regardless, it sounds like there’s a high likelihood of them either returning to their teams or switching teams with each other, the latter of which would make things even more interesting in the AL East.\n\nRed Sox Fans Get Concerning Update In Alex Bregman Sweepstakes",

    "fullText": "Georgia vs. Ole Miss end-of-game delay: Explaining chaos in final moments of 2026 Sugar Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ole Miss Rebels are advancing to the College Football Playoff semifinals, but it didn’t come easily.\n\nThe Rebels had to overcome a nine-point halftime deficit, navigate plenty of back-and-forth calls, and contend with a strong performance from Georgia’s offense in the Sugar Bowl. Even after a game-winning field goal, Ole Miss faced added drama in the final seconds.\n\nJust when the game seemed over following a safety on the final kickoff, officials added time to the clock, giving Georgia one last possession after a somewhat lengthy delay. Ole Miss held on for a 39-34 victory.\n\nHere’s a look at the chaotic final moments of the Sugar Bowl.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Trinidad Chambliss' huge game vs. Georgia\n\nThe biggest play of the night for Ole Miss was a field goal from Lucas Carneiro with six seconds remaining in regulation after Georgia had come back to tie it at 34. With the 48-yard field goal, Ole Miss reclaimed the lead and put a ton of pressure on the Bulldogs to make some magic happen in the final moments of their season.\n\nOLE MISS MAKES THE KICK WITH SIX SECONDS REMAINING 😱 pic.twitter.com/fJC66nZ8Al\n\nOn the following kickoff, Georgia's Landon Roldan returned the kick out of the end zone, but he then turned to throw the ball back behind him. But nobody else was there, partially due to one of his teammates falling to the ground, allowing the ball to bounce all the way to the other sideline and out of bounds.\n\nInitially, it appeared that the game was over from time expiring, and Ole Miss received an extra two points from the safety.\n\nRegardless, both teams emptied onto the field as if the game was over, stages were brought onto the field and Ole Miss was celebrating.\n\nOLE MISS WINS!\n\nHere's the go-ahead field goal and ensuing kickoff that resulted in a safety.\n\nSean McDonough on the call for ESPN. 🏈🔥🎙️ #CFPhttps://t.co/DHgVt8xsAWpic.twitter.com/qA3qFgoQIO\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) January 2, 2026\n\nHowever, it became clear that the officials weren't completely satisfied with the game's conclusion. On the kickoff play, there was ruled to be one second still remaining, meaning the Bulldogs had to go out for a free kick.\n\nAfter players made their way back onto the field, Georgia then recovered its free kick, so no time was taken off the clock. That meant the Bulldogs then got an opportunity for one more play with a second remaining, lining up for a ton of pitches and anything they could muster up with no time left.\n\nAfter plenty of laterals, Ole Miss finally ended it for good by tackling Gunner Stockton. Minutes after appearing to already win the game, including a Gatorade bath for head coach Pete Golding, the Rebels officially got the win.\n\nThe saga included entire stages being pushed on and back off the field:\n\nAnd here's the *official* ending after a bit of chaos.\n\nSean McDonough: \"Matt, this is feeling like an excruciating ending to a classic game. Does common sense need to prevail here?\"\n\nMatt Austin: \"Well, yes, but we do have rules we have to follow.\" 🏈🦓🎙️ #CFPhttps://t.co/UZIoeWwxK8pic.twitter.com/Puh9ym6fsT\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) January 2, 2026",

The Bulldogs’ postseason experience, defensive strength and a regular season win in Athens weighed on many minds.\n\nThat confidence did not survive Thursday night in New Orleans.\n\nOle Miss stunned third-ranked Georgia 39-34 in a chaotic College Football Playoff quarterfinal that featured 30 combined fourth quarter points, multiple lead changes and one of the most unusual endings in bowl history.

It sent them to the Fiesta Bowl for a semifinal matchup against Miami.\n\nNo love for Ole Miss #SugarBowl#CFBPlayoffpic.twitter.com/eJcNIRwSIF\n\n— Jeff Hauser (@radiohauser) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Rebels, now 13-1 and the CFP’s No. 6 seed, looked nothing like the underdog most of the pregame panel envisioned. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss carved up the Bulldogs for 362 yards and two touchdowns, repeatedly answering Georgia rallies with poise and precision. His 40-yard strike to De’Zhaun Stribling on third down late in the fourth quarter set up Lucas Carneiro’s decisive 47-yard field goal with six seconds remaining.\n\nCarneiro was flawless all night, drilling three field goals, including Sugar Bowl-record kicks of 55 and 56 yards as Ole Miss totaled 473 yards of offense. Georgia finished with 355 yards but couldn’t come up with the final stop when it mattered.\n\nGeorgia had erased a 10-point deficit in the final minutes, tying the game on Peyton Woodring’s field goal with 55 seconds left. That rally only heightened the drama before Ole Miss delivered the final blow.\n\nIt was the kind of result that shows why the games are played on the field.

    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics continued their longest road trip of the season on Thursday night, heading to Sacramento for their third of four games on the West Coast. Taking on a Kings team that has struggled mightily all season, the Celtics could not find their rhythm early, dropping a first quarter contest for the fifth straight game, but were able to right the ship when it was most needed.\n\nThe matchup was tightly contested through the first three quarters, and even with the Kings playing much improved on the night, Boston pulled away thanks to their superstars stepping up in the fourth quarter. Derrick White struggled from the field for most of the game, but all starters except Jordan Walsh finished in double figures, with 7 Celtics total ending the game with double digit point totals.\n\nHere's a quick recap of the Celtics 14-point victory over the Kings on Thursday:\n\nFourth quarter: Outscoring the Kings by 14 points in the final quarter, that was exactly what Boston needed to carry them to the victory. Derrick White struggled for most of the game, but put up 14 of his 16 total points in the fourth, coming up clutch with his two made 3-pointers in that time as well.\n\nBench contribution: Sam Hauser, Luka Garza, Anfernee Simons, and Hugo Gonzalez all showed up and performed well off the bench for Boston on Thursday night. As a unit, the bench scored 46 points, showing great balance from them and the starters. Sacramento had two big contributions off their bench from Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis who combined for 34 points, but Boston's bench unit did a little bit of everything to fill up the stat sheet.\n\nPaint domination: In filling up the stat sheet, the Celtics outrebounded the Kings 40-32, and continued their control down low by putting up 50 points in the paint. Not only did Boston outrebound Sacramento, but they outscored them by 10 points in the paint, which was influenced by Neemias Queta who faced off against his former team that cut him.\n\nWOAHHH OK NEEMI 😤 pic.twitter.com/PEP743Tgxa\n\n— Boston Celtics (@celtics) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Celtics will close out their West coast road trip on Saturday, while finishing off their two-game series against the Los Angeles Clippers. In their first matchup Boston pulled out a 121-118 victory which saw Jaylen Brown and Payton Pritchard combine for 63 points back in November. The Clippers have been one of the hottest teams in the NBA over the past two weeks, winning five straight games although they're still 10 games under .500 on the season. Los Angeles is still led by Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, and Ivica Zubac who is averaging 15 points and 11 rebounds on the year. Despite their poor record, the Clippers should bring a challenge to Boston which has struggled to get off to a good starts during the road trip.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: Celtics use big fourth quarter to close out Kings in 14-point win",

The game was already in hand at that point. It wasn’t the most efficient game for Brown (11-25 FG), but there was no one on the Kings who could stop JB whenever he felt like driving to the cup.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Brown decided to merely put his head down and use his athleticism on a straight line to the rim; no fancy moves needed. One such example occurred at the end of the first half, when Brown used a basic between-the-legs dribble to advance past the older DeMar DeRozan for a left-handed finish.\n\nJaylen to end the half.

Anfernee Simons was similarly effective, tallying 14 off the pine (4-of-7 from distance).\n\nThe Celtics out-rebounded the Kings, 40-32. Sacramento was sharp from the line (14-15 FT) but merely room temperature from downtown (33 percent), mostly due to Russell Westbrook (2-for-9) and Dennis Schröder (3-for-8) combining for 12 long-distance bricks.\n\nNext up for the Celtics is a Saturday night showdown with the Clippers in Los Angeles. The Clips have been playing well of late and Kawhi Leonard looks rejuvenated. It’ll be a nice test for Boston.\n\nJoe Mazzulla Explains What Luka Garza Is Doing to Earn Minutes In Celtics Rotation",

    "fullText": "Trinidad Chambliss and Ole Miss are now the biggest story in college football after an upset of No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl to advance to the College Football Playoff semifinals.\n\nThe No. 6 Rebels (13-1) overcame a 21-12 halftime deficit with some unbelievable play from Chambliss and a clutch field goal from Lucas Carneiro in the final seconds of the game to win, 39-34. Chambliss went 30/46 passing for 362 yards and two touchdowns as the Rebels used a 20-10 margin in the fourth quarter to put the game on ice.\n\nThis is not a game Georgia (12-2) loses entering the fourth quarter with a lead. In fact, it was the first game in 76 tries that a team defeated the Bulldogs when it had the lead going into the fourth quarter. SEVENTY SIX FOLKS THATS SPECIAL.\n\nThere will probably be some children conceived in Mississippi tonight who will be named Lucas. The sophomore placekicker Carneiro converted a 47-yard field goal with six seconds remaining to make it 37-34, but he set the Sugar Bowl record for longest field goal twice in the first quarter with a 55-yard kick then a 56-yarder shortly after to set and reset the record.\n\nThe Ole Miss defense held Georgia to 343 offensive yards including 124 rushing yards at only a 3.4 yards per attempt average. This is one of the big differences from the first version of this game with the defense stalling Georgia when it mattered most and holding Gunnar Stockton to just over 200 yards passing.\n\nKewan Lacy led all rushers for the Rebels with 98 yards and two touchdowns. Lacy had what seemed to be a gamechanging fumble in the first half that was returned for a Georgia touchdown, but the sophomore RB just seemed to get stronger as the game went on. The determination of this team and the mental toughness shone through the most mounting a comeback against one of the most talented teams in the country.\n\nFrom the wide receiver room, Trey Wallace led the way with nine catches for 156 yards and a touchdown. De’Zhaun Stribling also flexed on the shorthanded Bulldog secondary with seven catches for 122 yards.\n\nTruly, this Thursday night was one of the biggest wins in Ole Miss football history. A seventh Sugar Bowl championship second best all time for the Rebels is just some additional icing on the cake.\n\nIt’s now one week until a showdown with No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Ariz.

Unbelievable!\n\nI lost count of the number of times they killed the atmosphere and flow of the game by going down and feigning injury.\n\nI wish referees would see this for what it is: cheating — or bring in the rugby rule where trainers can come on the pitch but allow play to continue.\n\nNot perfect, but it would be a start in tackling this gamesmanship.\n\nMy neutral friend at the match said he was the most inconsistent he’d seen.\n\nMy mate is a Bolton fan and despite what we think, he said the standard in League One is better than we saw last night.\n\nThankfully, it didn’t spoil a great performance.\n\nManchester City were on a run of eight victories coming into this fixture — and one of those was against us at the Etihad Stadium, so we know what this opponent is capable of.\n\nNone of the home players could be faulted. The defence and midfield were outstanding whilst we restricted City to just four shots on target.\n\nWe’ve gone ten Premier League games without defeat at home and this outstanding point was gained with seven players out — six at AFCON and Dan Ballard, who also missed out against Leeds United.\n\nMany have remarked on how this team likes to defend, and we’ve earned seven clean sheets so far — including three on our travels.\n\nErling Haaland was very effectively shackled by Nordi Mukiele but we also chose players with attacking intent, with Eliezer Mayenda, Brian Brobbey and Simon Adingra starting. We also had four shots on target then brought on Wilson Isidor and Romaine Mundle later in the game.\n\nBearing in mind that just over a year ago, we lost at Stoke City, the plan has been executed to perfection, with great recruitment. We’re now an established Premier League side.\n\nAs mentioned, it is very hard to fault any of the players but I felt that at crucial moments we lacked coolness and calm in front of goal — especially the chances for Brobbey, Mundle and Adingra.\n\nThis argues for some attacking recruitment in the winter transfer window; I still feel we need a wily “fox in the box” who can hit the back of the net but can also pass on his experience to the younger strikers.\n\nIt would be unconstructive to try to pick any other faults after another outstanding home performance, but there’s been a huge turnover of players in the past year and over the next couple of weeks, we may see some more players who were crucial to our progress in that period departing.\n\nIt could be “farewell” to Dan Neil, Aji Alese and others — adding to Patrick Roberts, Jobe and Tommy Watson.\n\nClearing the decks and balancing the books is very important in business terms.\n\nThat was one of the most gritty points we’ll get this season and from one to eleven (plus our substitutes) the Lads were all massive.\n\nThe defence faced up to everything that was thrown at them and got a well-deserved share of the points.\n\nA special mention for Nordi Mukiele, who showed how to outmuscle Erling Haaland. He was my man of the match, but there were a lot of contenders.\n\nI was chuffed for Mayenda as he’s made a great claim for a continued run on the right — during the AFCON period and maybe beyond.\n\nHis pace, aggression and ability to run at defenders with the ball gave us extra options and to hear his song chanted time and again was fantastic.\n\nHopefully he has his confidence back and can really contribute.\n\nThe chances we created have been converted in other games and to miss the chance to nick a narrow win against City leaves me with a similar feeling to the Liverpool away game.\n\nA point is great though — so we take it and move on.\n\nThe decisions made by the man in black left a lot to be desired but that’s a common occurrence.\n\nI honestly thought we’d get better officials at this level but it seems they perform poorly at all levels.\n\nIt didn’t ruin the game but it didn’t help us. Better luck next time, hopefully!\n\nHands up everyone who thought our unbeaten home record would fall?\n\nI’ll admit I was one, not only because after the Leeds game I thought we were missing Dan Ballard, Reinildo and Noah Sadiki — which isn’t a slight on the players who’ve come in — but also because we were up against the dominant force in the Premier League over the last ten to fifteen years, and a team who after a shaky time last season have looked more like their old selves in the past couple of months.\n\nWe’ve seen off Arsenal at home; we’ve seen off “the visitors” and now we’ve seen off the machine that is Manchester City. Who else is out there?\n\nI think he has a lot in his locker for a young striker and last season in the Championship, he worked hard after a bright opening to the campaign, a bit of a indifferent period after injury and then came on strong in the second half of the year to play a significant part in our promotion.\n\nAs we went into this season, I felt that if there was one player in our ranks from the Championship squad who could make an impact in the Premier League, it was him.\n\nI think he’s been a bit unlucky not to get more chances so far with the form of Wilson Isidor and Brian Brobbey, but we looked more balanced and carried more of an attacking threat with him in our ranks.\n\nI hope he keeps his place and gets a run in the side, as he has more to offer.\n\nThis match summed up why we are were we are and not fighting a relegation battle.\n\nUnlimited commitment from everyone in a red and white shirt and in the last half hour with City piling forward, we were throwing bodies from all angles in front of the ball.But it wasn’t all about the Blues and we opened up enough chances to have got a goal ourselves.\n\nCity know they got a game from us — and there’ll be top teams in the Premier League who won’t give City as much as a test as we did.\n\nI have no real downs to report and considering how I dreaded it might have turned out you have to be happy with the point, and it wasn’t a lucky point at that.\n\nIt was fully deserved from our view, we are still unbeaten at home going into the New Year and we now have twenty nine points from nineteen games and sit in seventh place halfway through the season.",

    "description": "John a Wilson feels that now is the time for Sunderland AFC to reaffirm its links with its Durham heartlands!",
    "fullText": "Before I moved away from the North East nearly a quarter of a century ago, one of my favourite places to wander around was Durham, with its beautiful cobbled streets, the castle and cathedral.\n\nIn fact, the view from the bridge over the River Wear, with the castle towering on the east bank, is one of the most picturesque and loved scenes in the country (according to a TV programme from the 1990’s) competing with Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh, various Lake District scenes and St. Michael’s Mount and Tintagel in Cornwall.\n\nBrought up in North Shields and having gone to school in Newcastle’s West End, I was used to being surrounded by Mag fans, but unlike other stories I’ve heard about school life, there was never — to my knowledge — violence linked to the team you supported.\n\nNevertheless, as you can imagine, I got more than enough ear-bashing and taunting from Newcastle supporters, yet there was some solace to be found in my old school’s slogan, which began: “By the banks of the silvery Wear, ‘neath proud Durham’s towered shrine”, which referred to the burial place of St. Cuthbert — the school I attended.\n\nIt was always nice to get away from Newcastle City or North Shields, where it would’ve been careless to wear any Sunderland colours or sport the badge on a hat. Durham always felt safe. I was on home territory — County Durham and Wearside.\n\nHistorically, Sunderland was part of County Durham.\n\nThe old county borough was abolished in 1974, with the formation of the new “Metropolitan County of Tyne and Wear”. The Durham coalfields had strong ties to Sunderland AFC and the Durham Miners’ Association recognises their shared heritage.\n\nSunderland is often seen as a “Durham Miners’ Club” and for people in County Durham — certainly when I was growing up and before my exile from the North East — supporting Sunderland was often the default choice. Whilst some areas leaned towards Newcastle United, it’s fair to say that Durham generally favoured supporting the Lads.\n\nI’m not sure when the phrase “Durham Mag” became a thing, as it certainly sounds like an oxymoron and it wasn’t a phrase that was coined before the turn of the century.\n\nSome people claim it emerged during the Kevin Keegan years as the visitors experienced a surge in success and media attention which resulted in many younger people in neighbouring County Durham becoming Mag fans. Sunderland’s fall from grace over the last ten years didn’t help, as youngsters — for the most part — want to support a successful or at least a Premier League side.\n\nThis whole topic came to the fore after the recent Leeds match, when I decided to stay in Durham after the game.\n\nAt check in, the lady at the desk asked if I’d travelled far. I told her I’d driven up from Worcestershire but that I’d only just come from the Sunderland game. She gave me a stern sideways look and jokingly said, “Oh, you support them, do you? Boo!”\n\nI was quite taken aback and informed her that when I used to live locally, most of Durham was red and white — we were, after all, on the banks of the Wear.\n\nShe retorted that “These days, it’s about half-and-half in the area of Sunderland fans and Mags”.\n\nI’m not an expert as I never actually lived in County Durham, but some references I’ve seen suggest that it used to be 80% to 20% in favour of supporting the Black Cats, whereas now, it’s nearer to 50/50. But no wonder the term “Durham Mags” has such a negative connotation — it’s used pejoratively to imply that these supporters are “plastic fans” or “glory hunters” who lack a genuine local or heritage connection with Newcastle.\n\nHopefully this season is the start of the fightback and a marker for when school children will want to start supporting the red and whites — the dominant team in the North East, derby victors, and a team going places.\n\nA team that isn’t aligned to dodgy Arab owners, that cares about the community, and has a long-term plan and identity in place.\n\nHappy New Year, and haway me bonnie lads!",

    "description": "Ben McKevitt looks at the main stories from Sunderland’s entertaining New Year’s Day draw with Pep Guardiola’s side!",
    "fullText": "Cirkin’s future at the club has been up for significant debate during the last six months and beyond, with his ability to step up to Premier League level consistently questioned in his absence.\n\nHe’s been thrown in at the deep end to start his Premier League career, and a hot-and-cold performance against Leeds led to a lot of scrutiny, but I think it’s clear that Cirkin can definitely hold his own at this level.\n\nHe was composed, sharp, progressive and incisive down the left, defending valiantly throughout and rarely making an error. It felt like City were targeting the right hand side of our defence — which was unsurprising considering how well Cirkin locked down the left channel.\n\nHis injuries came at a terrible time and he was unfortunate to have to wait this long for his chance, but he’s certainly impressing. It was the performance of a player who can hold his own at this level and whilst I don’t think he’ll displace Reinildo, he can be a more than worthy deputy in this league.\n\nEach week, it’s becoming clear just how much Brobbey brings to the side when he leads the line.\n\nHe provides an incredible outlet when under the cosh — especially when facing teams like City who largely dominate possession and heap on the pressure. He gave City’s defenders an absolute nightmare yesterday, consistently holding the ball up and bringing others into play as we aimed to get an opener.\n\nHowever, it’s not just the hold-up play, as he has the pace and power to drive in behind a defence.\n\nA huge opportunity came after he demonstrated unbelievable strength to run off Ruben Dias and going through against Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nUnfortunately, Brobbey couldn’t convert his chance and the game continued at 0-0. I’d love to see him convert more of these chances as they’re opportunities you’d hope your striker would score, but thankfully he contributes massively to the team without the goals.\n\nI think Brobbey’s ability is especially pronounced when he’s replaced by Wilson Isidor, who provides less strength and hold-up prowess in the latter stages.\n\nWhile we often naturally fall back into a more defensive shape towards the end of games, I feel Brobbey’s absence contributes to the gradual move backwards and Isidor just can’t replicate his impact at the moment.\n\nSunderland’s opportunities largely came in a lively first half in which the Lads pushed City to the absolute limit with a fantastic team performance.\n\nBrobbey’s massive chance was well manufactured but poorly executed in the end, and Simon Adingra’s erratic style led to a big opportunity to strike on goal going astray, eventually leading to a sloppy Trai Hume strike which sailed over the bar.\n\nIt was Hume who soon found himself in a position of huge promise after Granit Xhaka placed a wonderful cross right onto his head at the penalty spot and whilst he attempted a glancing effort at goal, he couldn’t manage to use the pace of the ball to guide it on target.\n\nAs the game developed, Mayenda had a great chance of his own to get a strike on goal after a characteristically wonderful pick-out by Enzo Le Fée, which the Spaniard couldn’t quite get under control.\n\nFrom here, City began to ramp up the pressure and create opportunities of their own. Savinho, Erling Haaland and Joškl Gvardiol all came close to breaking through — and could’ve done on another day — but a combination of fine goalkeeping from Robin Roefs and a mammoth effort from the Lads managed to keep them out.\n\nThe chances we carved out are a great sign that we can go toe to toe with one of the best teams in the world and push them to their limit. The game could’ve gone either way on the basis of the chances, and it’s good to see Le Fée getting time and space in the middle to improve our creativity.\n\nHe’s a magician in those areas and is somehow doing his own job of creating and inventing while replacing the running of the absent Sadiki — amazing work again from the Frenchman.\n\nIt was great to see Mayenda back in the starting lineup.\n\nIt was an unorthodox shape at times but Mayenda showed that he has the ability to form a good relationship in a two with Brobbey or to provide that creative spark from the right. His play can be a tad erratic but I think that helps him to be unpredictable and dangerous when facing up against defenders.\n\nOur chance creation throughout the season has been our weakest aspect and players who can provide a spark are priceless in this division. We’ve said it from the start of the season — he has all the attributes to succeed at this level and he just needs the chance to grow into it.\n\nI’d love to see him continue getting chances to impress, and I think we’d benefit from it.\n\nAnother Le Bris masterclass, then.\n\nI feel like he’s somehow still underappreciated across the wider media landscape at the moment — perhaps due to his own quiet nature. However, he’s orchestrating some of the best football we’ve ever experienced at the Stadium of Light and it can’t keep going unnoticed. The players and the setup at the club are brilliant, but Le Bris brings it all together and stands at the core of everything we do.\n\nThe system that Le Bris set up yesterday felt ever-changing and difficult to fully nail down to a formation, regardless of whether we were in or out of possession.\n\nHowever, he’d clearly done his homework as it allowed us to exploit weaknesses in behind City’s backline numerous times across the ninety while retaining good levels of control on the game, and I wasn’t surprised to see that he was disappointed that we couldn’t take all three points.\n\nIt’s half way through our first season back, we’re seventh in the league and disappointed not to be beating Manchester City. Incredible stuff.\n\nThe entire defensive unit was incredible. It’s a sentiment which could likely be duplicated across most performances this season but yesterday was up there with the best.\n\nOmar Alderete and Nordi Mukiele were unbelievable and Erling Haaland may not have a more difficult game this season — he was marshalled out of the game, with just a single opportunity on his weaker foot throughout.\n\nWatching the two of them take turns in just going through everything in their way to clear their lines was spectacular, and Alderete’s tidy feet often provided some great openings to counter.\n\nHaving Roefs to rely on must be a dream for a defender and he gave another key performance between the sticks. Instinctive saves and intelligence when playing out from the back allowed us to stay in the game and build into attacks effectively. His influence is priceless and amazing at such a young age.\n\nIt must be reiterated that we’re without several key performers at the back — including Dan Ballard and Reinildo.\n\nIt’s an unbelievable feat which has allowed us to earn our tenth consecutive unbeaten game at home. We keep rolling on.",

    "fullText": "The mercury reading might’ve plummeted to well below zero by the time the Lads and the Etihad aristocrats kicked off on New Year’s Day, but after ninety-plus minutes of fast, furious and fascinating football, the Stadium Of Light had warmed up nicely — even as 40,000+ headed for the exits and into the icy grip of a winter Wearside night.\n\nThe outcome? 0-0. The conclusion? Sunderland can play. We can mix it. We can stand firm and we can deliver results from seemingly improbable situations.\n\nStripped of our AFCON contingent and the injured Dan Ballard, the smart money might’ve been on a routine victory for Pep Guardiola’s ever-evolving and ruthlessly slick footballing machine.\n\nHowever, I don’t think Régis Le Bris nor his players believe in the “smart money” theory — just as legendary Australian batsman Don Bradman claimed he didn’t believe in the law of averages — and as Sunderland’s reshuffled side held firm to deny the visitors a victory (perhaps throwing a spanner into their title works in the process) how could you not feel a sense of overwhelming pride at this side’s development, ability and commitment to the cause?\n\nMy goodness, this really is a team to be proud of.\n\nIt’s a group of players blessed with a unique mixture of skill and steel; of physicality and growing football intelligence, and under the watchful eye of Le Bris, we’re adding real value to the league, standing firm in the face of any and all challenges — and on this occasion, defending our unbeaten home record with incredible ferocity.\n\nAfter such a superb team display, I could throw some names into the mix and appraise them duly, so I shall.\n\nDennis Cirkin? Outstanding. The victim of some frankly disgraceful criticism in some quarters, the left back handled the occasion and the opposition superbly, showing composure, positional awareness and no lack of attacking instinct. This was exactly the kind of performance he would’ve hoped for, and Reinildo’s absence may be less worrisome as a result.\n\nRobin Roefs? Colosssal. He’s just that good. Simon Adingra? Unbelievably industrious. Brian Brobbey? A handful all evening. Eliezer Mayenda? A real livewire. He played like a man with a point to prove and added some fresh impetus to the red and white attack.\n\nOn and on it could go, because each of the lads in red and white did themselves proud on Thursday evening.\n\nSimply put, they weren’t content to shut up shop and hope for a City off-night. Instead, they took the game to the visitors, made life tough for them and could’ve easily emerged as victors had some of the outstanding chances we created been converted.\n\nCity captain Bernardo Silva has form for lamenting occasions on which opposing teams don’t roll over, sit back and allow his side to dominate — so what would he have felt in the aftermath of this outstanding Sunderland display?\n\nSometimes, it’s just not your night.\n\nAn early City goal being ruled out for offside might not have seemed alarming for Guardiola and his men, but as the game unfolded and Sunderland probed, pressed and chased without mercy, it became clear that this wasn’t going to be the walkover that many — including this writer — feared.\n\nErling Haaland simply wasn’t able to influence proceedings; Phil Foden was relatively quiet and in the City goal, I didn’t think Gianluigi Donnarumma was the tower of strength and composure that Ederson used to be, either.\n\nIn contrast, the Lads were steadfast in their refusal to be breached.\n\nEven without Ballard, the central defensive partnership of Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete was immense and there was no lack of aggression in midfield, either. If this is the kind of result a team affected by absences can achieve, what’s possible with some January reinforcements and the return of the lads currently representing their countries in Morocco?\n\nIn the context of our season, this felt like a huge bonus for Sunderland; the sort of point you grab with both hands, add to the total and reflect on a job very well done.\n\nWhen Arsenal visited Wearside earlier in the season, we gave them a bit of a shock by rallying from 1-2 down to draw 2-2. To me, this felt even more significant — another outstanding display against a world class outfit from a side that you simply can’t fail to love.\n\nIn victory, the players conduct themselves as winners should.\n\nIn defeat, there’s a calm period of reflection and when we shook hands with our opponent after sharing the points on New Year’s Day, we could allow ourselves a moment to digest the fact that we blunted one of English football’s finest teams and ensured that we kicked off 2026 on another hugely positive note.\n\nThat’s something to which we can all raise a glass.\n\nSunderland: Roefs, Hume, Mukiele; Alderete, Cirkin, Geertruida; Xhaka, Mayenda, Le Fée; Adingra (Mundle 72’), Brobbey (Isidor 58’)\n\nSubs Not Used: Patterson, Hjelde, O’Nien, Jones, Rigg, Neil, Tutierov\n\nManchester City: Donnarumma, Nunes, Dias; Ake, O’Reilly (Gvardiol 57’), Bernardo Silva (Reijnders 85’); González (Rodri 46’), Foden, Cherki; Savinho (Doku 51’), Haaland\n\nSubs Not Used: Trafford, Heskey, Khusanov, Mukasa, Lewis",

    "fullText": "The clock has struck midnight on Jan. 2 on the East Coast, meaning the transfer portal has officially opened.\n\nOver 1,000 names have been entered into the portal, with more surely to come soon. With the opening of the portal comes the search for a new school, with players announcing their schedule of what programs they're visiting.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks have been one of the top transfer destinations during head coach Dan Lanning's tenure, with success stories such as safety Dillon Thieneman, defensive tackle Bear Alexander and wide receiver Malik Benson standing out in 2025 alone.\n\nUAB Blazers wide receiver Iverson Hooks, who announced his intentions of entering the portal last week, officially released the seven schools that he'll visit, with the Ducks among them. He has visit dates scheduled for Wisconsin, Indiana, Oklahoma State, LSU and Auburn, with dates for visits to Oregon and Louisville listed as to be announced.\n\nNEWS: UAB standout transfer WR Iverson Hooks is set to visit 7 Schools, his agent @WeGetYouOffers tells @On3Sports\n\nWisconsin: January 3-4\nIndiana: January 4-5\nOklahoma State: January 6-7\nLSU: January 7-8\nAuburn: January 8-9\nOregon & Louisville: TBAhttps://t.co/RlUbB6Fk7q pic.twitter.com/w2rqBhd28y\n\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) January 2, 2026\n\nHooks is a redshirt junior, having spent the first four seasons of his career at UAB. He recorded under 200 receiving yards in both 2023 and 2024, but broke out as the Blazers' leading receiver this season, totaling 927 yards and seven touchdowns on 72 receptions. Despite his standout efforts, UAB finished 4-8.\n\nAt 5-foot-10 and 175 pounds, Hooks is a jitterbug out of the slot. He's not a deep threat, as he averaged just 12.9 yards per catch, but he's dangerous with the ball in his hands due to his speed.\n\nThe Alabama native is rated as a three-star transfer by 247 Sports, coming in as the No. 40 wide receiver in the portal and No. 159 player overall.\n\nDue to a season-ending injury in which he played in just three games during his redshirt freshman season, Hooks will have two seasons of eligiblity remaining.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: UAB transfer WR Iverson Hooks to visit Oregon, date TBD",

    "description": "The Sugar Bowl between Ole Miss and Georgia was a game so nice it ended thrice.",
    "fullText": "A game as good as the Sugar Bowl between Ole Miss and Georgia had to have a wild ending. It ended up having three of them.\n\nIn one of the more confusing endings to a football game you will ever see, Ole Miss twice celebrated what it thought was the final play of a breakthrough win in the College Football Playoff, only to be told the game hadn’t ended.\n\nIn both cases, the crew working the stage for the trophy ceremony had already moved it onto the field, then had to awkwardly remove it as the game played on.\n\nThe refs REALLY drew this one out 😭 pic.twitter.com/oDdgVjvjLg\n\n— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) January 2, 2026\n\nThe sequence of events worked out like this.\n\nAfter a frantic drive that saw Ole Miss reach the Georgia 30-yard line in less than a minute, Ole Miss kicker Lucas Carneiro broke a 34-34 tie with a 47-yard field goal. That appeared to be the game-winner, but six seconds were still left on the clock, so Ole Miss had to kick the ball back to Georgia, opening the door for a miracle for the Bulldogs.\n\nInstead, an attempt at a cross-field lateral resulted in the ball bouncing out of bounds, but not without first hitting the pylon. That made it a safety for Ole Miss, putting the Rebels up five points with one second left. Ole Miss had already been celebrating the win, with quarterback Trinidad Chambliss hugging teammates and several non-players and coaches already running onto the field.\n\nThe officials restored order and had Georgia make its free kick, which went 10 yards and then was recovered by Bulldogs running back Cash Jones. However, Ole Miss thought that the final second of the game had still passed and celebrated accordingly, giving head coach Pete Golding a Gatorade bath as the ESPN announcers pronounced the game over.\n\nNope. The officials ruled there was still one second left on the clock … and Georgia had the ball at its own 31-yard line. ESPN announcer Sean McDonough said the ending felt “excruciating” and asked rules expert Matt Austin, “Does common sense need to prevail here?”\n\nAustin’s response. \"Well, yes, but we do have rules we have to follow.”\n\nAnd so Georgia got its last play, completing one forward pass and nine laterals before quarterback Gunner Stockton was slammed to the ground, 80 yards short of the end zone. The game was over, for real this time.\n\nYou can watch the whole thing play out below:\n\nThe official play-by-play of that final desperation play:\n\nSTOCKTON, Gunner pass short to the left complete for 4 yards to YOUNG, Colbie caught at the UGA35 and advanced to the UGA35 lateral to JONES, Cash for 1 yard to the UGA36 lateral to LUCKIE, Lawson for -3 yards to the UGA33 lateral to JONES, Cash for 5 yards to the UGA38 lateral to YOUNG, Colbie for -7 yards to the UGA31 lateral to YOUNG, Colbie for -5 yards to the UGA26 lateral to LUCKIE, Lawson for 7 yards to the UGA33 lateral to JONES, Cash for 13 yards to the UGA46 lateral to YOUNG, Colbie for -14 yards to the UGA32 lateral to LUCKIE, Lawson for 0 yards to the UGA32 lateral to BELL, Dillon for -11 yards to the UGA21 lateral to MADDOX, Adrian for -2 yards to the UGA19 (PERKINS, Suntarine;JONES, Andrew), clock 00:00.\n\nThis could have become even more chaotic, but the end result was what everyone expected after Carneiro made his kick. Ole Miss will advance to the semifinal of the College Football Playoff and face Miami. Georgia’s season is over. Rebels head coach Pete Golding is $500,000 richer. So is former head coach Lane Kiffin.\n\nAnd we saw firsthand just how far officials will go to end a game by the book.",

    "fullText": "Modern software systems understand what users do, but not how users feel or function.\n\nClicks, taps, ratings, and text inputs have become the dominant form of “human feedback.” These signals are explicit, sparse, and often arrive too late to be useful. Meanwhile, humans continuously emit rich physiological and behavioral signals that reveal stress, focus, fatigue, calm, and engagement — signals that today’s systems largely ignore.\n\nToday, we’re introducing Synheart — a privacy-preserving Human State Interface (HSI) infrastructure that enables modern systems to understand human state in real time, ethically, locally, and through standardized representations.\n\nMost human–computer interaction systems rely on:\n\nYet human state is always present.\n\nStress, focus, emotional load, and behavioral patterns continuously influence decision-making and performance — but modern systems have no native way to perceive or represent them.\n\nSynheart introduces a new primitive for computing systems: human state.\n\nInstead of collecting raw biosignals or subjective feedback, Synheart transforms physiological signals (such as heart-rate-derived features) and digital behavior into structured, machine-readable human state outputs.\n\nThese outputs describe what the human system is doing internally — not just what the user clicks.\n\nHuman state becomes a first-class signal, alongside time, location, and interaction.\n\nAt the core of Synheart is the Human State Interface (HSI).\n\nHSI is a foundational interface standard for representing and exchanging human state across independent systems — similar in role to GPS coordinates or HTTP responses.\n\nHSI does not transmit raw biosignals.\n\nIt represents interpreted human state in a safe, structured form.\n\nThis allows systems to reason about human state without ever accessing sensitive biometric data.\n\nSynheart is built with privacy as a non-negotiable constraint.\n\nUsers retain control. Developers get insight. Systems remain ethical.\n\nTo support a diverse wearable ecosystem, we’ve introduced Synheart Wear a while ago.\n\nSynheart Wear is a vendor-agnostic library that reads biosignals from consumer wearables and normalizes them into a unified signal layer.\n\nIt abstracts away hardware differences so developers and researchers can focus on human state, not device-specific integrations.\n\nTo complement physiological signals, Synheart includes Synheart Behavior — a cross-platform SDK for capturing and transforming digital interaction patterns into structured behavioral signals.\n\nSynheart Behavior models how users interact with digital systems — such as timing, rhythm, switching, and interaction fragmentation — and converts these patterns into numerical behavioral features, without accessing content, text, or personal data.\n\nThe SDK abstracts application- and platform-specific interactions into a unified behavioral signal layer, allowing developers and researchers to reason about human behavior, not interface details.\n\nThese behavioral signals power downstream systems such as:\n\nImportant: Synheart Behavior analyzes interaction dynamics, not what users type, read, or see.\n\nNo content inspection. No surveillance. Privacy by design.\n\nDevelopers can install Synheart Core SDKs directly on device and build applications that adapt to human state in real time.\n\nSynheart is also a research platform.\n\nAll specifications, schemas, and whitepapers are publicly available from day one.\n\nWe believe human-state-aware computing must be built in the open.\n\nOur goal is not a single product, but an ecosystem where:\n\nWe’re working toward a future where human state is a first-class signal in computing.\n\nHuman-state-aware systems begin here.",

    "fullText": "洪 民憙 (Hong Minhee) @hongminhee@hackers.pub\n\nI recently added sync/async mode support to Optique, a type-safe CLI parser\nfor TypeScript. It turned out to be one of the trickier features I've\nimplemented—the object() combinator alone needed to compute a combined mode\nfrom all its child parsers, and TypeScript's inference kept hitting edge cases.\n\nOptique is a type-safe, combinatorial CLI parser for TypeScript, inspired by\nHaskell's optparse-applicative. Instead of decorators or builder patterns,\nyou compose small parsers into larger ones using combinators, and TypeScript\ninfers the result types.\n\nThe type inference works through arbitrarily deep compositions—in most cases,\nyou don't need explicit type annotations.\n\nLucas Garron (@lgarronLucas Garron) opened an issue requesting\nasync support for shell completions. He wanted to provide\nTab-completion suggestions by running shell commands like\ngit for-each-ref to list branches and tags.\n\nAt first, I didn't like the idea. Optique's entire API was synchronous, which\nmade it simpler to reason about and avoided the “async infection” problem where\none async function forces everything upstream to become async. I argued that\nshell completion should be near-instantaneous, and if you need async data, you\nshould cache it at startup.\n\nBut Lucas pushed back. The filesystem is a database, and many useful\ncompletions inherently require async work—Git refs change constantly, and\npre-caching everything at startup doesn't scale for large repos. Fair point.\n\nSo, how do you support both sync and async execution modes in a composable\nparser library while maintaining type safety?\n\nThe fourth requirement is the tricky one. Consider this:\n\nThe combined parser should be async because one of its fields is async.\nThis means we need type-level logic to compute the combined mode.\n\nI explored five different approaches, each with its own trade-offs.\n\nAdd a mode type parameter to Parser and use conditional types:\n\nThe challenge is computing combined modes:\n\nA variant of Option A, but place the mode parameter first with a default\nof \"sync\":\n\nThe default value maintains backward compatibility—existing user code keeps\nworking without changes.\n\nDefine completely separate Parser and AsyncParser interfaces with\nexplicit conversion:\n\nSimpler to understand, but requires code duplication and explicit conversions.\n\nThe minimal approach. Only allow suggest() to be async:\n\nThis addresses the original use case but doesn't help if async parse() is\never needed.\n\nUse the technique from fp-ts to simulate Higher-Kinded Types:\n\nThe most flexible approach, but with a steep learning curve.\n\nRather than commit to an approach based on theoretical analysis, I created\na prototype to test how well TypeScript handles the type inference in practice.\nI published my findings in the GitHub issue:\n\nBoth approaches correctly handle the “any async → all async” rule at the\ntype level. (…) Complex conditional types like\nModeValue<CombineParserModes<T>, ParserResult<TState>> sometimes require\nexplicit type casting in the implementation. This only affects library\ninternals. The user-facing API remains clean.\n\nThe prototype validated that Option B (explicit mode parameter with default)\nwould work. I chose it for these reasons:\n\nThe CombineModes type computes whether a combined parser should be sync or\nasync:\n\nThis type checks if \"async\" is present anywhere in the tuple of modes.\nIf so, the result is \"async\"; otherwise, it's \"sync\".\n\nFor combinators like object(), I needed to extract modes from parser\nobjects and combine them:\n\nThe type system handles compile-time safety, but the implementation also needs\nruntime logic. Each parser has a $mode property that indicates its execution\nmode:\n\nCombinators compute their mode at construction time:\n\nLucas suggested an important refinement during our\ndiscussion. Instead of having run() automatically choose between sync and\nasync based on the parser mode, he proposed separate functions:\n\nPerhaps run(…) could be automatic, and runSync(…) and runAsync(…) could\nenforce that the inferred type matches what is expected.\n\nI applied the same pattern to parse()/parseSync()/parseAsync() and\nsuggest()/suggestSync()/suggestAsync() in the facade functions.\n\nWith the new API, creating an async value parser for Git branches looks\nlike this:\n\nNotice that parse() returns Promise.resolve() even though it's synchronous.\nThis is because the ValueParser<\"async\", T> type requires all methods to use\nasync signatures. Lucas pointed out this is a minor ergonomic issue. If only\nsuggest() needs to be async, you still have to wrap parse() in a Promise.\n\nI considered per-method mode granularity (e.g., ValueParser<ParseMode, SuggestMode, T>), but the implementation complexity would multiply\nsubstantially. For now, the workaround is simple enough:\n\nSupporting dual modes added significant complexity to Optique's internals.\nEvery combinator needed updates:\n\nFor example, the object() combinator went from around 100 lines to around\n250 lines. The internal implementation uses conditional logic based on the\ncombined mode:\n\nThis duplication is the cost of supporting both modes without runtime overhead\nfor sync-only use cases.\n\nMy initial instinct was to resist async support. Lucas's persistence and\nconcrete examples changed my mind, but I validated the approach with a\nprototype before committing. The prototype revealed practical issues (like\nTypeScript inference limits) that pure design analysis would have missed.\n\nMaking \"sync\" the default mode meant existing code continued to work\nunchanged. This was a deliberate choice. Breaking changes should require\nuser action, not break silently.\n\nI chose unified mode (all methods share the same sync/async mode) over\nper-method granularity. This means users occasionally write\nPromise.resolve() for methods that don't actually need async, but the\nalternative was multiplicative complexity in the type system.\n\nThe entire design process happened in a public GitHub issue. Lucas, Giuseppe,\nand others contributed ideas that shaped the final API. The\nrunSync()/runAsync() distinction came directly from Lucas's feedback.\n\nThis was one of the more challenging features I've implemented in Optique.\nTypeScript's type system is powerful enough to encode the “any async means all\nasync” rule at compile time, but getting there required careful design work and\nprototyping.\n\nWhat made it work: conditional types like ModeValue<M, T> can bridge the gap\nbetween sync and async worlds. You pay for it with implementation complexity,\nbut the user-facing API stays clean and type-safe.\n\nOptique 0.9.0 with async support is currently in pre-release testing.

    "description": "Kyiv deception operation pays off as Moscow intelligence fooled by assassination claims",
    "fullText": "As far as the Russians were concerned, they had got their man.\n\nDenis Kapustin, one of the most prominent anti-Putin Russians fighting on behalf of Ukraine, was reported dead on Dec 27, assassinated by a drone on the southern front.\n\nHe had long been hunted by Moscow and the price on his head reflected this: Russian intelligence services had offered $500,000 (£370,000) to anyone who killed him.\n\nRussia paid this out after news broke of the successful hit this week. But what Vladimir Putin’s intelligence services did not know was that they had handed the money directly to Ukraine.\n\nMr Kapustin, known by his nom de guerre “White Rex”, founded the pro-Ukrainian Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) in 2022.\n\nThe group made headlines in 2023 and 2024 when it carried out cross-border incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions, humiliating the Russian president and his generals.\n\nHis death was first confirmed by the RDK itself. “We will definitely take revenge, Denis,” the group said on Telegram. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nYet on New Year’s Day, in a morale-raising ruse, Mr Kapustin re-emerged – alive and unscathed – in a video posted by Ukraine’s military intelligence (HUR).\n\n“Welcome back to life,” Gen Kyrylo Budanov, head of HUR, said with a wry smile. He congratulated Mr Kapustin and his team on a successful operation to deceive their Russian adversaries.\n\nIt turns out HUR, along with the RDK, had hatched a plan to fake Mr Kapustin’s death and claim the $500,000 bounty from Russia for themselves, to be used in Ukraine’s war effort.\n\n“First of all, Mr Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” Gen Budanov added.\n\nRussia’s FSB and GRU agencies have long been feared for their ruthlessness.\n\nBut Ukrainian intelligence, throughout the near four-year war, has consistently proved its ability to outsmart their Russian counterparts, carrying out assassinations of generals and Kremlin officials on Russian soil, orchestrating complex sabotage operations and recruiting Russian agents.\n\nIn November, it was reported that Ukraine’s intelligence services used Russia’s own agents to accept missions offered openly by the FSB for financial reward and sabotaging its objectives.\n\nIn one case, a Ukrainian double-agent accepted a task from a Russia jobs board to build a bomb, which was then handed to a Russian saboteur.\n\nThe bomb, however, was made using flour and the Russian agent was captured by Ukraine after it failed to detonate.\n\nUkraine has also claimed responsibility for assassinations of high-ranking Russian officials, while Kyiv is suspected to have been behind many others.\n\nIn April, Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy chief of the main operations directorate of Russia’s army, was killed by a car bomb on Nesterov Boulevard in the Balashikha suburb of Moscow.\n\nBaza, a Russian media outlet with sources inside law enforcement agencies, said the home-made bomb was strapped to a parked Volkswagen car and detonated remotely when Moskalik, who lived in the neighbourhood, walked past.\n\nA month later, a former Ukrainian politician was shot dead in what appeared to be a professional hit job at the entrance of an exclusive school in Madrid.\n\nAndriy Portnov, a pro-Russian politician who worked as a close aide to the Moscow regime, was dropping off his daughters when an assassin shot him several times.\n\nThe shooting took place at the American School of Madrid while other parents were also making the school run.\n\nMost recently, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head ‍of the Russian army’s operational training ‍directorate, died in an explosion on Dec 22 in Moscow, probably planted by Ukrainian special forces.\n\nThe force of the explosion was such that at least seven cars parked nearby also sustained damage\n\nThe general worked in the Russian ministry of defence and participated in combat operations in Chechnya, Syria and Ossetia as well as Ukraine.\n\nAmong the most striking assassinations was the killing of Lt Gen Igor Kirillov on Dec 17 2024.\n\nThe officer, who was in charge of Russia’s nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, was killed by a remotely detonated device hidden inside an electric scooter.\n\n“Kirillov was a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against the Ukrainian military,” a Ukrainian security source said.\n\nIn a daring mission in June 2025 – dubbed Operation Spiderweb – Ukraine-operated drones destroyed several Russian surveillance aircraft and nuclear-capable bombers, with officials in Kyiv saying this rendered a third of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers useless.\n\nThe drones had been smuggled into Russia and assembled, and launched from trucks deep within Russian territory, in another huge victory for Ukraine’s spies.\n\nUkraine’s latest intelligence success means Denis Kapustin, a far-Right extremist and former football hooligan, is inside Ukrainian territory and “preparing to continue carrying out assigned tasks”, said a Ukrainian commander.\n\nThe commander’s family moved from Moscow to Germany when Mr Kapustin was 17 and he relocated to Ukraine in 2017.\n\nSince 2019, he has been banned from entering the Schengen Area for promoting neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nIn the early weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Mr Kapustin helped set up units that would become Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade that played a key role in defending Kyiv and later become renowned for its fierce fighting on the eastern front.\n\nResponding to reports of his death, the 3rd Army Corps said: “We together confronted the common enemy in the battle for Kyiv.”\n\nIt added on Dec 27: “He perceived [Ukraine] as a place of real resistance and freedom.”\n\nIn August 2022, Mr Kapustin set up the RDK, with the goal of overthrowing Putin to bring “peace to Russia”. Its stated aim is to end Putin’s regime of “lies, corruption, and lawlessness”.\n\nIt is made up of former Wagner Group recruits, some former FSB agents and civilian volunteers. It is deemed a terrorist organisation by Russia.\n\nRussian courts have twice sentenced Mr Kapustin to life imprisonment in absentia on treason and terrorism charges.\n\nIn March 2024, the RDK stormed into Russia alongside other anti-Kremlin militias on tanks and armoured vehicles. It clashed with Russian security services and captured Russian soldiers.\n\nKyiv has said that while it fights as part of Ukraine’s military, under its command, the incursions into Russia were not taking place under Kyiv’s orders.\n\nSince its incursions, the group is either fighting at the front or engaged in cross-border sabotage operations in Russia.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph in September, an RDK commander known as “White”, a 26-year-old Russian volunteer, described how he joined in order to exact revenge on Putin for invading Ukraine.\n\n“We fight to change something in Russia,” he said. “When the war ends, I will continue fighting until Putin falls.”",

    "fullText": "The imminent 130th anniversary of the Louis Vuitton monogram is less a birthday and more a demonstration of how powerful two letters can be.\n\nBorn in 1896, when the Époque was at its most Belle, the superposed initials LV appeared amidst a variety of foliate and geometrical motifs. At first it was not a success. “The public was initially reticent and demanded the chequered and even the striped canvas, but my father stood firm,” recalled Gaston-Louis Vuitton of his father Georges Vuitton, son of the founder.\n\nThe striped and chequered patterns he mentions refer to previous designs. Every decade or so, Vuitton changed the pattern of the canvas with which it covered its famous, flat-topped trunks. Trianon grey came first in 1858. In 1872, the grey gave way to stripes. The checkerboard Damier pattern came in 1888, and was the first time that the maker’s name appeared on luggage, with the words “Marque L Vuitton Déposée” (which translate as “L Vuitton registered trademark”) appearing every so often in the checks.\n\nThe Damier was intended to scare off counterfeiters. It didn’t work — which leads us to the monogram we know today. If Georges thought that this new design would deter the fakers, a summer stroll along a 21st-century Mediterranean beach, with its itinerant vendors of imposter Louis Vuitton bags, shows just how comprehensively he failed.\n\nGeorges Vuitton had inadvertently created one of, if not the, most recognisable hieroglyphs in the history of luxury goods. This was not branding as we know it today; it was more akin to an artist signing a canvas. As well as a hint of the Japonisme, the mania for all things Japanese that gripped France in the late 19th century, the geometric emblems attested to Georges Vuitton’s fascination with the ogives and spandrels of Gothic architecture. In particular, he was a great admirer of the work of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, the French architect who revolutionised the study and restoration of medieval architecture.\n\nViollet-le-Duc’s reputation may since have faded, but the patterned monogram is known in every corner of the globe. This January, the house will embark on a year-long celebration with the familiar dramatis personae taking to the stage: the Speedy of 1930; the Keepall, also from 1930; the Noé, made for a champagne producer in 1932 to carry five bottles (four upright and the fifth inverted); the Alma, Parisian architecture translated into handbag in 1992; and, finally, the Neverfull of 2007 — capable, so Vuitton says, of carrying up to 100 kilogrammes but more usually functioning as a capacious tote.\n\nThe bags will appear in different guises throughout the anniversary year. Most striking of the three celebratory capsules is Monogram Origine, a collection of the classics (minus, for some reason, the Keepall), that returns to Georges’s first pattern but deploys a newly developed coated linen/cotton canvas that comes in its recognisable chocolate-brown Ebène shade as well as a soft rainbow of pastels. All of which provide further proof, if further proof were needed, that at 130 years of age, the famous monogram is as versatile as it is well known.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO, Calif. (FOX5/KUSI) — Heavy rain soaking San Diego on New Year’s Day caused widespread flooding and prompted multiple water rescues across the county, as storm runoff overwhelmed roads and drainage systems and left drivers and pedestrians trapped in fast-moving water.\n\nSome of the most severe flooding was reported in Mission Valley, a low-lying area known for flooding during periods of sustained rain. Water remained pooled in parts of the neighborhood hours after the heaviest rainfall, underscoring how quickly conditions deteriorated.\n\nEmergency crews responded to numerous rescue calls throughout the day, including along Fashion Valley Road, where rising floodwaters stranded motorists. In one incident, firefighters rescued one adult and one child from a Jeep that became partially submerged as water levels rose rapidly.\n\nSan Diego Fire-Rescue officials said another rescue unfolded nearby at Camino de la Reina and Avenida del Rio, where a man became trapped underneath a bridge as floodwaters surged. Search-and-rescue teams deployed a raft to reach him and safely pulled him out before transporting him to a hospital for medical evaluation.\n\n“This is about as bad as I’ve seen it,” said Mission Valley resident Steven Shadpour, who noted that flooding has been a recurring issue in the area. “They told us when I bought the place that Mission Valley is lower elevation, so whenever it rains, it floods down here.”\n\nFire officials emphasized that many of the rescues were preventable and urged the public to avoid flooded roads.\n\nCrews also responded to other storm-related emergencies across the county, including a rescue at Lake Hodges, where a woman was swept by floodwaters and later rescued by helicopter.",

    "title": "13 Dirty Truths About Hybrid Cars Everyone Should Know",
    "description": "Hybrids promise fuel savings and eco-friendliness, but the full story is more complicated. From costly battery replacements to limited highway efficiency, these vehicles come with trade-offs that many buyers overlook. Their environmental impact starts with resource-heavy battery production and ends with complex recycling challenges. This article breaks down the hidden costs and realities behind the hybrid hype.",
    "fullText": "The narrative around electric vehicles has hit a few speed bumps lately. Despite years of relentless marketing and massive production ramps, the EV takeover hasn't quite materialized as some predicted. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz have both extended the life of combustion and hybrid lineups as EV demand has grown more uneven than expected. Volkswagen has said it may keep ICE models longer and even add new ICE offerings without increasing overall investment, by offsetting spending within its existing plan. Mercedes-Benz has also said it will keep upgrading combustion models and has reported higher-than-previously-planned spending on combustion-engine technology alongside delayed electrification targets.\n\nOn the other hand, hybrids are experiencing a surge in popularity, with manufacturers competing to offer a dizzying array of options. It's easy to see the appeal: they promise that sweet spot of substantial fuel savings without the existential dread of range anxiety. For many drivers, it seems like the ultimate compromise.\n\nBefore you sign on the dotted line for that virtuous hybrid, let's yank back the curtain. Hybrids, for all their supposed eco-cred and practicality, come with their own collection of dirty little secrets.\n\nLike their fully electric counterparts, many hybrids rely on lithium-ion batteries. Extracting the necessary metals, lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite, requires heavy-duty mining operations. Needless to say, these aren't exactly quaint backyard digs. The environmental impact is monumental: think open-pit mining operations that resemble lunar landscapes, carving out vast sections of pristine wilderness.\n\nConsider the thirst: Some commonly cited estimates for brine-based lithium extraction in arid regions put water losses at around ~2–2.2 million liters per tonne of lithium, but water use varies widely by site and extraction method (brine vs hard-rock; definitions of ‘water used’ also differ). In arid regions, this puts immense strain on local water supplies, impacting surrounding communities and fragile ecosystems. Beyond the H2O, the chemicals used during extraction and processing are often toxic, posing a significant risk of contaminating soil and groundwater if not meticulously managed. So, that \"green\" hybrid in your driveway might have a rather large, dirty footprint you never see.\n\nBattery warranty terms vary by brand and market. In the U.S., 8 years is common, and some manufacturers offer longer coverage (for example, Toyota extended hybrid battery coverage to 10 years/150,000 miles for 2020 model-year hybrids). While many last beyond that, there's an undeniable truth: they will eventually degrade to a point where replacement is the only viable option.\n\nAnd here’s where your wallet might go into shock. Even though hybrids pack smaller battery packs than pure EVs, they are far from cheap. Hybrid batteries are usually cheaper than full EV packs, but replacements can still be expensive. Many mainstream hybrid battery replacements are often quoted in the roughly $2,000–$8,000 range depending on the vehicle, battery type, and whether the pack is new or remanufactured. By contrast, full EV battery pack replacements are commonly cited in the $5,000–$16,000+ range because the packs are much larger.\n\nIt’s not like you’ll be swapping these out in your garage with a ratchet set; this is a specialized job, meaning you’ll also be on the hook for significant labor costs and the often-overlooked expense of proper battery disposal. That \"savings at the pump\" might just be a future mortgage payment in disguise.\n\nSure, lithium-ion batteries can be recycled at the end of their life cycle. But \"can be\" and \"is readily done\" are two entirely different things. The process is anything but simple. It requires energy-intensive pyrometallurgy or complex hydrometallurgy, far from a casual drop-off at your local recycling center.\n\nCurrently, the infrastructure for large-scale, cost-effective lithium-ion battery recycling is still in its infancy. Few companies are willing to invest heavily in a process that’s both technically challenging and not yet highly profitable. This means it will be a while before someone cracks the code on how to recycle these power packs on a scale large enough to have a significant, positive environmental impact. If you're having a shop replace your high-voltage hybrid battery, Battery handling and end-of-life pathways vary by region and program; recycling exists but can be costly and logistically complex, which can affect what a shop charges for handling.” (No citation needed; this avoids a hard factual claim you can’t universally prove).\n\nThe hybrid variant of a given car model invariably carries a higher sticker price than its gas-only counterpart. While they are generally more affordable than pure EVs, that upfront premium can put them out of reach for budget-conscious buyers.\n\nMany owners justify this extra expenditure by banking on long-term fuel savings. The harsh reality? It can take several years, or even tens of thousands of miles, to actually break even on that initial investment through fuel savings alone. This is particularly true if you're one of those who replace their car every few years; you might never recoup that premium before the next vehicle purchase.\n\nOpting for a hybrid to \"reduce your carbon footprint\" is a noble intention, but it assumes you'll be running predominantly on battery power. The inconvenient truth is that most hybrids are still fundamentally internal combustion engines with electric assistance. They do burn gasoline, and they do emit CO2 into the atmosphere.\n\nFactor in the energy-intensive battery manufacturing process and the vehicle's entire lifecycle emissions (LCA), and you might find yourself with a vehicle that, by some metrics, has a higher initial carbon footprint than a conventional ICE car. Your \"eco-friendly\" commuter still chugs gas, just perhaps with a touch more virtue-signaling.\n\nSure, some hypercars like the McLaren P1 or Ferrari LaFerrari utilize hybrid technology, but that's for mind-blowing power delivery, not just economy. Your average, everyday hybrid is meticulously engineered to maximize fuel efficiency, typically pairing a modest gas engine with electric motors.\n\nThe added weight of the battery pack and electric motor, coupled with the relentless focus on efficiency, sometimes means hybrids are slower to accelerate than their pure ICE counterparts. That extra mass also compromises handling and agility, making them feel less nimble when you try to toss them into a corner. Your hybrid's \"sport mode\" is often just louder engine noise; don't expect it to win any drag races, unless it's against a kid on a scooter.\n\nWhen everything is humming along nicely, or if your hybrid is still comfortably under warranty, maintenance costs may be comparable to those of an ICE vehicle. However, that's often still more than the bare-bones servicing requirements of a pure EV.\n\nThe real financial hit comes when that warranty expires. Hybrids feature dual powertrains, meaning they combine the complexity of a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) with high-voltage electric motors, inverters, battery management systems, and specialized cooling systems. If a high-voltage component fails out of warranty, repairs can be astronomically expensive.\n\nFinding an affordable, independent mechanic who possesses the specialized diagnostic tools and training for hybrid systems can also be a significant challenge, often forcing you to return to the pricier dealership service bay. Another hit to your savings that may put that dream car purchase back yet again, good thing you have your hybrid, I guess.\n\nHybrids are undisputed kings in city driving. Their electric motors excel in stop-and-go traffic, enabling electric-only propulsion at low speeds and recovering energy through regenerative braking. This translates to significantly lower fuel consumption than a gas-only car in urban environments.\n\nHowever, once you hit the open highway, that advantage rapidly diminishes. A hybrid's fuel consumption often rises drastically, the opposite of what you see in an ICE vehicle. At cruising speeds, the gas engine is predominantly engaged. Because it's usually a smaller, less powerful unit lugging around extra battery weight, it has to work harder than an equivalent, lighter ICE car. Your hybrid's city MPG bragging rights tend to disappear faster than a cheap date on the interstate.\n\nWe're constantly fed the narrative that hybrids are inherently more environmentally friendly, but as we've dissected, that's not necessarily true, especially if your driving mostly consists of highway miles. Additionally, if your weekly commute is a short trip to the grocery store and back, paying a significant premium for a hybrid might never yield any financial benefits.\n\nFor a hybrid to truly deliver both environmental and economic advantages, you need to cover a substantial amount of miles, predominantly in city driving or stop-and-go traffic, where the electric assist can do its best work. Otherwise, you're just driving a heavier, more complex gas car.\n\nWhen it comes to pulling heavy loads, traditional gasoline and diesel engines are still the undisputed champions. Even some new EVs, such as the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and Tesla Cybertruck, are proving their mettle in this arena.\n\nHowever, for most mainstream hybrids, towing is an afterthought, if it's even allowed. The smaller internal combustion engines are not designed for sustained heavy loads, and the hybrid systems often lack the necessary cooling capacity or robust driveline components. You're clearly not going to be towing more than a Barbie convertible with something like the Prius.\n\nThe Toyota Sequoia’s maximum tow rating is up to 9,520 lbs when properly equipped (Toyota marketing often highlights up to 9,500 lbs, with exact ratings varying by configuration). The Lexus LX Hybrid is rated up to 8,000 lbs. It's good enough for some campers, but most hybrids are coming nowhere near these numbers. Meanwhile, plenty of gas-fueled SUVs and pickups can breezily tow 10,000-plus pounds, giving you a lot more variety of choices to choose from if towing is your priority. But if the Toyota Sequoia is your dream car, you're in luck.\n\nThat shiny new hybrid typically comes with a steeper insurance bill than its traditional ICE counterpart. This makes perfect sense when you consider the higher purchase price and the increased technological complexity. Insurance companies aren't charities, after all.\n\nBecause hybrid vehicles involve more expensive, specialized components (especially the battery and high-voltage wiring) and require specialized labor for repairs, insurance claims and associated repair costs tend to be higher. Insurance costs vary heavily by model and driver, but some analyses find hybrids average around single-digit percentages higher to insure than comparable gas-only vehicles (one widely cited figure is ~7% higher on average) to insure a hybrid compared to the equivalent gas-only model. That \"eco-friendly\" car also has an \"expensive-to-fix\" price tag for the insurance company.\n\nThe sophisticated lithium-ion batteries found in hybrids (and EVs) are quite particular about their operating environment. They absolutely despise extreme temperatures. When it’s scorching hot, it accelerates battery degradation, leading to a permanent loss of capacity over time. Conversely, when the mercury plummets, the battery's chemical reactions slow down, leading to a noticeable reduction in range, power output, and less efficient regenerative braking. What are they, Goldilocks? Apparently, the temperature has to be juuuust right.\n\nCold temperatures can also significantly impact charging times for plug-in hybrids, forcing the gas engine in standard hybrids to run more frequently and for longer periods to reach optimal operating temperature, thereby directly negating the fuel-saving benefits. Your \"advanced\" battery is pickier about the weather than your aunt Mildred.\n\nToyota famously revolutionized the automotive world with the original Prius hybrid, and the technology has evolved dramatically since then. However, the regulatory landscape is shifting. The EU previously set rules aiming for effectively zero-CO₂ new car sales from 2035, which would have ruled out most hybrids. However, in December 2025 the European Commission proposed changes that would replace an effective 2035 ICE ‘ban’ with a 90% tailpipe CO₂ reduction target, potentially allowing some combustion and hybrid-type vehicles to continue under certain conditions due to their reliance on an internal combustion engine.\n\nMeanwhile, pure EVs are advancing at a breakneck pace, and other alternative technologies like e-fuels (synthetic gasoline) and hydrogen fuel cells are gaining traction. It's entirely plausible that hybrids, despite their current popularity, are merely an interim technology, a bridge to a truly fossil-fuel-free future, destined to be phased out as more efficient and advanced solutions mature. Are hybrids the Betamax of the automotive future or a viable long-term solution despite all their flaws? Only time will tell. In that time, we will be crossing our fingers for your wallet.\n\nLike our content?

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te on Thursday vowed to defend the self-ruled island’s sovereignty in the face of China’s “expansionist ambitions,” days after Beijing wrapped up live-fire military drills near its shores.\n\n“In the face of China’s rising expansionist ambitions, the international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people have the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in his New Year’s address.\n\n“As president, my stance has always been clear: to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, strengthen national defense and the resilience of the whole society, and comprehensively construct an effective deterrence and democratic defense mechanism,” he added.\n\nLai’s comments came days after China wrapped up live-fire drills around Taiwan featuring rocket launches, aircraft and warships. Beijing had expressed anger at a planned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, as well as at Japan’s new leader’s comments that Tokyo could intervene in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to annex it by force if necessary. A former Japanese colony, Taiwan has been governed independently from the mainland since 1949, when the Nationalist Party lost a civil war against the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island.\n\nLai's speech was met angrily in Beijing, where a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office called the president “a saboteur of peace, a troublemaker and a warmonger,” according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n“No matter what Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party authorities say or do, they cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China,\" said spokesperson Chen Binhua.\n\nThe planned arms sale, valued at more than $11 billion, is the U.S.’s largest so far to Taiwan. It includes missiles, drones, artillery systems and military software.\n\nThe United States is obligated by its own laws to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nChina’s leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan’s eventual annexation “ unstoppable \" during his own televised New Year’s address on Wednesday.\n\nTaiwan last year announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called the Taiwan Dome.\n\nThe budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island’s GDP, as part of his strategy amid China’s threats of invasion.\n\n“Facing China’s serious military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait,” Lai said.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing.",

Details regarding the nature of his injuries have not been publicly disclosed, though they were described as minor.\n\nThe driver involved in the crash — who had been hired for the trip — was also treated at a hospital and released today. However, TMZ reports that the individual could face criminal charges.\n\nAdditionally, the driver of the stationary truck that Joshua’s car hit is wanted by authorities for fleeing the scene after the fatal crash.\n\n“He could be hit with reckless driving charges as a result of Monday’s incident,” TMZ reported. “The driver of the truck that Joshua’s SUV smashed into fled the scene immediately after the crash and is now being hunted down by officials.”\n\nMeanwhile, The Guardian Nigeria cited preliminary findings suggesting a mechanical failure may have played a role in the accident.\n\n“Preliminary investigations revealed a burst tyre was responsible for the accident in which two-time heavyweight champion Joshua survived but lost two close associates,” the outlet reported, adding that the front passenger-side tyre burst, causing the vehicle to lose control before colliding with a stationary truck.\n\nIn the days following the tragedy, an outpouring of support has emerged for the victims’ families. More than $180,000 has reportedly been raised in honor of Ayodele to help fund the construction of a mosque in his memory — a gesture reflecting the deep impact he had on those around him.",

It's helped to carry this market in 2025. I'm curious how you how you see that AI trade and trend evolving in 2026, Tom.\n\nGood afternoon, Josh. Thank you very much for having me on and happy New Year to everyone. Yeah, so, so we sort of described four pillars of the rally and the most important and first one as you said is AI. and it's really been a rising tide that's lifted all boats, not just this year, but for the past three and a half years, really. But we think that's changing a little bit in 2026. and importantly, it doesn't mean it's necessarily going away, but instead, I think the sort of AI enthusiasm is going to look a lot more like Q4 than it did say Q2 and Q3. and what I mean by that is that it's fractured. So we're not going to have every single tech stock just running away. It's going to become a selection of winners, say like your Micron, and then maybe some losers, like your Oracle and to a point Qualcomm. and I'm not saying to those stocks specifically into 2026, but more as an example that we're going to have to be selective as AI matures.\n\nWell, let me ask you, if AI is sort of more fractured next year, you know, if I'm a viewer or I'm an investor, I'm listening to that. How do I discern, Tom, then the winners and losers in this AI fractured world you're describing?\n\nSo for me, I look at AI as sort of a cycle that's maturing, right? And really the first stage was sort of it was it was the epiphany stage, right? Oh my gosh, we can do this. And then in order to do this, the first thing we need is semiconductors. And now we're going to run out and buy all the semiconductors that we can and obviously Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi have benefited fantastically from this. I see it evolving a bit now into those that those companies that are really taking the leading edge. Probably my top AI pick for 2026 is Google. I like Gemini 3. I think their advantage on search gives them a huge uh sort of chip in the game against Open AI. So I like Google from a search standpoint. I also like the memory because that's sort of the next stage of this data center build out, right? We need the compute power. Well now all of a sudden we need all the memory to power all that we need. So I see it more of an infrastructure play evolving uh towards memory on the infrastructure side, but then also from sort of the hyperscalers, I really like Google uh with YouTube and then with Gemini 3.",

    "fullText": "A “fireball” during the New Year’s Eve Potato Drop fireworks show appeared to shatter glass at a downtown Boise building, injuring a child, according to video and witness accounts.\n\nBoise Fire Department spokesperson Lauren Melink confirmed in an email to the Idaho Statesman that fire crews and Ada County EMS responded to West Bannock Street for reports of a child injured by glass that broke during the fireworks show immediately following the midnight potato drop.\n\nMelink said the child was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.\n\nThe Idaho Potato Drop did not respond to requests for comment Thursday morning.\n\nVideo from the event, which has taken place outside the statehouse since 2016, showed the 17-foot-long potato dropping from a crane as usual. But immediately after the enormous potato finished its descent, an explosion erupted from an area where fireworks were being lit. The video, filmed by Boise resident Joshua Dougherty, includes the sound of glass shattering as the explosion occurred.\n\n“I saw that giant fireball blast, felt it in my chest!” Dougherty told the Statesman via Facebook Messenger.\n\nDougherty, who was standing near the corner of Capitol Boulevard and Bannock Street, said he “immediately heard a ton of glass shattering, felt it raining down on me” and saw a child bleeding from her face.\n\nDougherty’s video shows shattered glass strewn across the sidewalk and broken panes in several window frames of the downtown building.\n\nThe Boise man said bystanders quickly called paramedics to the scene, and the fireworks show carried on without interruption.\n\nA post of Dougherty’s video shared in the Treasure Valley Police Scanner Facebook group garnered hundreds of comments and shares Thursday morning, including accounts from other attendees who said they saw or felt the blast, were hit by debris from the shattered windows or witnessed the paramedics’ response to the injured child.",

    "description": "How Joey McGuire won over Texas Tech with bold outreach and a seven-step plan to jump-start winning as the program's next head coach.",
    "fullText": "Experience isn't everything when it comes to hiring. Just look at Joey McGuire, the head football coach at Texas Tech University.\n\nWhen the Red Raiders began their head-coaching search in 2021, McGuire didn't have as stacked a résumé as his competition. As ESPN reported, he was \"a true underdog candidate.\"\n\nAt the time, McGuire had spent the majority of his coaching career at Cedar Hill High School in Texas, where he had notched three state championships. He also spent a few years as an assistant coach at Baylor.\n\nOn paper, it was the kind of background that would have given many Power 4 programs pause.\n\nTexas Tech's hiring committee may have completely overlooked McGuire had he not reached out himself. According to ESPN, he cold-called athletic director Kirby Hocutt, left a voicemail, and asked for the opportunity to interview.\n\nThat kind of bold outreach can be a differentiator.\n\n\"I always advise not to be too afraid of cold outreach,\" a former Google recruiter told Business Insider in 2023. \"If you're really interested in a company, get in touch with those you want to work with — email the CEO, the head of talent, or the hiring manager and let them know why you're the right person for the job.\"\n\nOnce McGuire got in the room, he made the most of it.\n\nESPN reported that he showed up to the interview with unmatched enthusiasm and \"a seven-step plan for winning.\" The publication said he had with him \"the full list of coaches he would like to hire. He had a detailed plan for fixing in-state recruiting and spoke of waking a sleeping giant.\"\n\nThe preparation left a lasting impression.\n\n\"We were all like, 'We found our guy,'\" Tony Hernandez, a former deputy athletic director and member of the search committee, told ESPN after the meeting.\n\nTexas Tech ultimately decided to go with McGuire, and the gamble has paid off.\n\nWhile the Red Raiders fell to Oregon in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals on Thursday, under McGuire, the team has surged from relative obscurity to a program-record 12 wins in 2025. They also secured their first outright conference championship since 1955 when they toppled BYU last month.\n\nMcGuire's story is a good reminder that a little preparation can go a long way, no matter what type of job you're applying for.\n\nAs business etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore told BI, \"Most people don't do the proper research about the company. We have so many resources to use, including LinkedIn, websites, and social media. There's no excuse for you to go into an interview and not know about the company and something about who might be interviewing you.\"",

So, like if I'm not moving, I feel awful, you know? And I'm like the kind of person that's like, and even if it's 20 minutes a day, you're golden,\" Hudson told podcast hosts Jessie and Lennie Ware.\n\nThe actor said she often uses that to encourage people who are reluctant to start exercising.\n\n\"I'm like, just go in for 20 minutes. Just like, move your body. Just go lift some weights. Stand in front of the mirror and just do something,\" Hudson said.\n\nEven a small amount of daily movement can create a \"domino effect\" that motivates people to make healthier choices and be more active, she said.\n\nHudson said she varies her workouts depending on how she's feeling, sometimes focusing on yoga, stretching, and breathwork, and other times on weightlifting.\n\n\"Even this morning, it's like, I couldn't not wake up and move my body,\" she said.\n\nShe told Women's Health in a 2019 interview that she eats about five times a day and her go-to workout is Pilates.\n\n\"I love how flexible I get and what it does to the shape of my body,\" Hudson said.\n\nIn an October interview with EatingWell, Hudson shared her morning routine, which includes going outside barefoot and spending time in the sun.\n\n\"I wake around 6 a.m. and do some sort of meditation practice while I drink warm water with lemon. I also try not to look at my phone during this time,\" Hudson said.\n\nHudson isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about fitting shorter workouts into their busy schedules.\n\nHelen Mirren, 80, has long been a fan of a 12-minute military workout developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1950s.\n\n\"It is the exercise I have done off and on my whole life. It just very gently gets you fit,\" Mirren said.\n\nIn February, Kristen Bell, 45, told Business Insider that she tries to fit short bursts of exercise into her days by treating them like exercise \"snacks.\"\n\n\"I keep a set of 10 or 15-pound weights underneath furniture so when I'm cooking dinner, if I haven't worked out that day, I'll do a set of bicep curls or shoulder presses while something simmers on the stove. Sometimes my workouts are sliced into my day in one-and-a-half-minute segments,\" Bell said.",

    "fullText": "Chinese tech stocks kicked off 2026 by testing how far their AI-fueled rally can run.\n\nShares of Shanghai Biren Technology, an AI chip designer, surged nearly 120% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by midday on Friday after the company raised 5.58 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $717 million, in an initial public offering.\n\nThe stock opened at 35.70 Hong Kong dollars, well above its IPO price of 19.60 Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThat appetite was reflected across the offering, with the retail portion subscribed more than 2,300 times, according to exchange filings, underscoring intense interest in China's homegrown AI hardware sector.\n\nThe enthusiasm has been building more broadly. Chinese AI and semiconductor stocks have rallied since the breakout of the China-made DeepSeek-R1 AI model in January last year, which helped push the Hang Seng Tech Index 23% higher in 2025. The index jumped by as much as 3.9% on Friday.\n\nWashington's tightening export controls on advanced Nvidia chips have also fueled the boom by accelerating demand for domestic alternatives.\n\n\"Nvidia's once-dominant position in China's AI chip market has effectively evaporated in 2025, marking a seismic shift in the global intelligent-computing landscape,\" wrote Andrei Zakharov, an analyst who publishes on Smartkarma, in a note last week.\n\nShanghai Biren's stunning stock market debut underscored China's AI rally, which reversed a few bruising years for the country's tech sector amid a regulatory crackdown and broad economic challenges.\n\nFollowing the DeepSeek-R1 breakout, startups such as Cambricon, Moore Threads, and Metax have drawn billions of dollars in funding as they race to supply chips for data centers, large language models, and industrial AI applications.\n\nThat surge in capital is also translating into personal fortunes, with China's AI chip boom minting billionaires at breakneck speed even as the broader economy continues to sputter amid a long-drawn property crisis.\n\nShanghai Biren's blockbuster debut is expected to be followed by more fresh supply, with Hong Kong emerging as the key venue for that fundraising drive.\n\nBaidu, a Chinese big tech firm, said on Friday that its artificial-intelligence chip unit has confidentially filed for a Hong Kong listing.\n\nAt least 25 companies made their market debuts in Hong Kong last month, marking the busiest month for IPOs since November 2019, according to Bloomberg data. About half of those listings were technology firms.\n\nMore AI-related Chinese tech listings are expected this month. They include startup MiniMax Group and Knowledge Atlas Technology, also known as Zhipu AI, which are expected to make their debut next week.",

    "fullText": "The California Department of Motor Vehicles said this week that approximately 325,000 Californians will be required to replace their Real ID licenses because of a software error.\n\nIn the coming weeks, DMV officials said, about 1.5% of those holding Real IDs will be notified that they “need to take action” to “ensure continued compliance with federal REAL ID regulations.”\n\n“The DMV is informing affected individuals of the steps they need to take,” officials said in a news release issued Wednesday. Fees associated with reissuing the IDS will be waived for those affected.\n\nDMV officials said the problem was discovered after a review of technology systems revealed that some legal immigrants had been issued Real IDs that did not expire at the same time as their authorization to remain in the country.\n\nThe Real ID Act was signed into law in 2005 and established security standards for state-issued IDs for things like boarding planes. But implementation was repeatedly delayed, and the requirement finally went into effect in May of 2025. DMV officials said they discovered that a “small subset” of Real IDs issued to lawful permanent residents “applied the standard credential renewal interval in some cases, instead of the expiration of a REAL ID holder’s authorized stay.”\n\n“We proactively reviewed our records, identified a legacy system issue from 2006, and are notifying impacted customers with clear guidance on how to maintain a valid California-issued credential,” DMV Director Steve Gordon said. “For nearly 99% of REAL ID holders, no action is required. The DMV remains committed to serving all Californians and ensuring REAL ID credentials meet federal standards.”\n\nOfficials said the problem came about because of “legacy coding from 2006.” But the release added that all those who had been issued Real IDs received them only after the federal system had verified their lawful presence in the country, and that no one who was undocumented got one.\n\nA.

The airline's daily flight from Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) will run for the last time on Feb. 14. For the time being, BGA will serve exclusively general aviation like flight training, air ambulances and agricultural flights as airport authorities remain in talks to try to bring in other commercial airlines.\n\n\"Air service decisions involve many factors that are outside the control of local airports and communities,\" GBA Commissioner of Aviation Mark Heefner said in a statement. \"We are in active discussions with Delta and are working closely with our state, local, and federal partners to re-establish passenger service as soon as possible.

Palantir's gain of more than 32-fold from its low in 2022 is one notable example.\n\nThe best part of the AI story is that it has probably just begun. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31% through 2033.\n\nThat probably means other stocks hold the potential for 10-fold gains by 2036. While a lot can happen in 10 years, these stocks are on track to make such gains as they help advance AI.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) may seem like a strange choice. For one, it lags market leader Nvidia in the AI chip industry, and it's up more than 13,000% from its 2015 lows.\n\nStill, AMD is on track to become the first company with the potential to match or possibly catch up to Nvidia in the AI accelerator market. The company has made the claim that its upcoming MI450 accelerator will accomplish that goal, and it will probably be onward and upward if it can meet that expectation.\n\nAdditionally, AMD's CPUs still make it a force in the PC market, and its gaming and embedded segments will also benefit from the technology it has developed.\n\nMoreover, AMD forecasts a 30% CAGR for revenue over the long term, with that rising to a 60% revenue CAGR for the data center segment that designs its AI accelerators.\n\nInvestors may have already begun to take notice, as AMD stock is up over 70% over the last year. Also, while its 105 P/E ratio could deter some investors, it's probable that others will buy shares at its current forward P/E ratio of 53. Such levels make it easier to take a chance on this increasingly influential AI giant.\n\nCoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) has begun to emerge as a leading AI cloud platform.\n\nIndeed, tech giants like Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure lead the overall cloud market. Still, CoreWeave has built a competitive advantage with a cloud specifically tailored for AI workloads, particularly when its ecosystem works with Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nAdditionally, CoreWeave takes on a task most companies don't want to do themselves, namely building and maintaining data centers. This means more organizations will probably turn to CoreWeave rather than taking on this task in-house.",

The four road closures were reported between 9:30 p.m. New Year's Eve and 5:20 p.m. New Year's Day.\n\nSo, how much rain have we gotten so far?\n\nMore: Flooding shuts down road in Desert Hot Springs on New Year's Day\n\nPhilip Gonsalves, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Diego, urged motorists to exercise caution and avoid driving through low-water crossings during a conversation about rainfall totals.\n\nHe said Palm Springs recorded about 0.58 inches of rain in the past 12 hours. The city typically receives less than a tenth of an inch on any given day this time of year.\n\nMeteorologists track rainfall from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30, which captures the region's full rainy season. In total, since October, Palm Springs has received 2.34 inches of rain, exceeding the normal 1.11 inches for that period.\n\nWinter storms typically bring limited rain to desert areas because surrounding mountains block much of the moisture — a rain shadow effect. The low-pressure system, Gonsalves said, pulled in deep tropical moisture from farther south, with moisture extending high into the atmosphere, allowing rain to fall even in areas that are usually shielded by the mountains.\n\nShowers are expected to taper off by mid to late afternoon Thursday as rain moves northeast out of San Diego County. Light, isolated showers could linger overnight, but they are expected to be brief and scattered.\n\nThe added moisture, however, comes with trade-offs.\n\n\"Everything comes with advantages and disadvantages, right? From one perspective, it's a good thing, but it comes with risks,\" he said. \"And in Southern California, one of the risks is flooding.\"\n\nAs rain ushered in the new year across the Coachella Valley, it's the kind of start that invites a little puddle-jumping while it lasts.\n\n\"Well, isn't that true for most things?\" Gonsalves said.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nJennifer Cortez covers education in the Coachella Valley.

    "fullText": "Tommy Lee Jones' daughter Victoria Jones was found dead on Thursday, Jan. 1, according to a report\n\nVictoria made some onscreen appearances in film and television in the early 2000s\n\nVictoria Jones, the daughter of actor Tommy Lee Jones, was found dead on Thursday, Jan. 1 in San Francisco, according to reports. She was 34.\n\nTMZ was first to report the news of Victoria's death, citing law enforcement sources.\n\nThe San Francisco Fire Department confirmed to PEOPLE that it responded to a medical emergency at the San Francisco Fairmont just before 3 a.m. local time on Thursday. The fire department said that an unnamed individual was found dead at the scene.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department additionally confirmed to PEOPLE that officers responded to the hotel on Thursday, where they met with paramedics and declared an unnamed adult female dead.\n\nNBC Bay Area also reported that a police source told the outlet that the woman found dead at the hotel is believed to be Victoria.\n\nA cause of death is unknown, though NBC Bay Area said that foul play is not suspected.\n\nThe San Francisco Fairmont, San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and a rep for Tommy did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's requests for comment.\n\nVictoria was the daughter of Tommy, now 79, and his ex-wife, Kimberlea Cloughley. The couple also shares a son, Austin Jones, 43.\n\nShe did some acting at a young age, first appearing in her father's film, Men in Black II, back in 2002. She was also in 2005's The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, a film directed by her father and which featured her stepmom, Dawn Laurel-Jones, as the stills photographer.\n\nIn addition to her film roles, Victoria made an appearance in the popular teen drama TV series One Tree Hill in one episode in 2003.\n\nTommy is, of course, an Oscar-winning actor, nabbing the Best Supporting Actor honor for 1993's The Fugitive. He has also appeared in JFK, the Men in Black series, No Country for Old Men and Lincoln, among other acclaimed projects.",

    "description": "Iowa football received some unexpected transfer portal news on New Year's Day.",
    "fullText": "Just one day after Iowa beat Vanderbilt in the ReliaQuest Bowl, the program received some unexpected news.\n\nThe NCAA transfer portal officially opens on Friday, but players can announce their intention to enter the portal now. The Hawkeyes have seen a couple of current players do just that, most notably sophomore running back Terrell Washington Jr. That was an expected move, as Iowa possesses a logjam of talent in the backfield, and Washington Jr. could easily get more playing time elsewhere.\n\nIowa saw another player announce their intentions to enter the transfer portal on Thursday, but this one caught many people by surprise. Sophomore punter Rhys Dakin took to X on Thursday with a statement announcing that he's planning to enter the transfer portal and to depart the program.\n\nThankyou, Iowa ❤️ pic.twitter.com/2U9DRZsZvs\n\n— Rhys Dakin (@Rhys_dak1n) January 1, 2026\n\nThis was a shocking announcement from Dakin, who many expected to return to Iowa City for his junior season in 2026. The sophomore had 42 punts in 2025, averaging 43.6 yards per punt with a long of 65 yards. That average was slightly down from his freshman year, when he was an All-Big Ten third-team selection by the media and second-team by the coaches.\n\nDakin had big shoes to fill, coming in immediately after Tory Taylor went to the NFL, and the young Aussie showed a lot of promise. He was coming off one of his best games of the season in the ReliaQuest Bowl, where he punted three times with a 49-yard average per punt. And now he's set to look for opportunities elsewhere.\n\nDakin's departure adds to the losses for the Iowa special teams unit heading into next season. Kicker Drew Stevens and return specialist Kaden Wetjen are set to graduate and move on, while special teams coordinator LeVar Woods is off to East Lansing to join Pat Fitzgerald's coaching staff. The Hawkeyes are going to have a lot of work to do in the portal and recruiting this offseason to replace the production walking out the door.\n\nIowa doesn't have another punter on the roster currently with eligibility for 2026, so Kirk Ferentz and company will look to the portal to find their next guy at that position. If there's one thing fans should trust Ferentz with, it's his commitment to the importance of special teams.\n\nWhile Dakin is a surprising and big loss, fans should believe in the coaching staff to find the right replacement.\n\nContact/Follow us @HawkeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Iowa news, notes and opinions. Follow Zach on X: @zach_hiney\n\nThis article originally appeared on Hawkeyes Wire: Iowa football punter Rhys Dakin to enter transfer portal",

    "fullText": "Indiana football made quite an emphatic statement in its College Football Playoff Rose Bowl quarterfinal matchup against No. 9 Alabama.\n\nBehind a three-touchdown afternoon from Fernando Mendoza and some relentless defense, the top-seeded Hoosiers embarrassed the ninth-seeded Crimson Tide 38-3 in \"The Granddaddy of Them All\" on Thursday, Jan. 1 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California to advance to their first CFP semifinal.\n\nThe Hoosiers' dominant \"business trip\" to the Rose Bowl made some history, as it is tied for the fourth-largest blowout win in the history of the College Football Playoff and the worst loss Alabama has sustained since 1998. It is the first bowl win for the Hoosiers since the 1991 Copper Bowl.\n\nWho's in CFP semifinals? Updated bracket, scores for College Football Playoff\n\nA 17-0 halftime lead for Indiana quickly snowballed into a 38-3 lead for the Hoosiers following Roman Hemby's 18-yard rushing touchdown at the 10:33 mark of the fourth quarter. Mendoza's 1-yard pass to Omar Cooper Jr. with 17 seconds remaining in the second quarter started a four-consecutive drive stretch for the Hoosiers where they scored a touchdown\n\nWith its win, Indiana now heads to Atlanta for another date against No. 5 Oregon on Friday, Jan. 9 in the CFP Peach Bowl semifinal, where the Hoosiers will look to beat the Ducks for the second time this season.\n\nHere's what to know on the biggest blowout win in College Football Playoff history:\n\nGeorgia owns the record for the biggest blowout win in the history of the College Football Playoff at 58 points against TCU in the 2022-23 CFP Championship game.

The Nittany Lions previously held it at 28 points from its 38-10 first-round win over SMU last season at Beaver Stadium in Happy Valley.\n\nHere's a look at the top 10 biggest blowout wins in the history of the College Football Playoff, including where Indiana's 35-point win over Alabama ranks amongst them:\n\n1.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have lost four of their last five games and are approaching the point in the season where many of their flaws need to be addressed. Their 128-106 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday raised questions of whether or not the team has developed an identity yet.\n\nThe Lakers once again were dominated by an opponent's athleticism, and it prompted head coach JJ Redick to reflect on a conversation he had with Hall of Fame Lakers coach Phil Jackson last season.\n\n\"Think about our team last year, this team is different,\" Redick said. \"Our identity will eventually be different. We didn't get that identity until late January, it felt like, and then we had to shift again.\n\n\"I don't think it's unnatural. I remember a meeting I had with Phil last year, pretty early in the season. And he said, 'I always felt like I knew who my team was by Thanksgiving.' I think that's hard to figure out with this team right now.\"\n\nLos Angeles hasn't been afforded the best bill of health this season. As LeBron James pointed out post game when asked a similar question pertaining to the team's identity, the Lakers have only played one or two games with their full roster.\n\nNot only did James miss the first few weeks of the season, but Austin Reaves is now sidelined for at least a month with a calf strain. Promising rookie Adou Thiero is out for a month with an MCL sprain just as he was starting to find his role on the back end of Redick's rotation.\n\nIt's not hard to see why the Lakers have struggled to find an identity through 30 games, even if, as Redick points out, it's a cop-out or excuse. Los Angeles hasn't been healthy enough to even begin laying the foundation of a true identity.",

Offensively, the Crimson Tide couldn't find any momentum in Pasadena.\n\nIndiana won 38-3, one of the worst CFP performances for the Crimson Tide in the illustrious history of its football program.\n\nHere's where Thursday's Rose Bowl loss ranks among Alabama's lowest-scoring CFP games ever.\n\nMORE: The biggest blowouts in College Football Playoff history\n\nAlabama has now played in a total of 15 College Football Playoff games since the format was introduced in 2014. Previously, only twice have the Crimson Tide failed to break 20 points in those CFP games.\n\nThursday's loss was the lowest-scoring Alabama performance in a playoff game. Before losing 38-3 to Indiana, Alabama's lowest-scoring performance in a CFP game was 16 points in the 2019 national championship. In that game, the Crimson Tide lost 44-16 to Clemson.\n\nHere are Alabama's lowest-scoring CFP games.\n\nAlabama barely avoided a shutout against Indiana, only notching a field goal over four quarters. The team hasn't been shut out in a game in 25 years; the last time the Crimson Tide failed to score in any game was on Nov. 18, 2000, when Auburn blanked Alabama 9-0 in the Iron Bowl.\n\nThe Tigers needed just three field goals in Tuscaloosa to claim their win, as their defense shut out the Crimson Tide. That was Mike DuBose's final game coaching Alabama before Dennis Franchione took over in 2001.\n\nMORE: Where Alabama ranks among all-time winningest college football teams\n\nNot only did Alabama allow 38 points and 413 yards of offense to Indiana, but the total numbers for the Crimson Tide offense were also rough.\n\nTy Simpson threw for 67 yards on 12 completions before backup quarterback Austin Mack went 11-for-16 with 103 passing yards. On the day, the Crimson Tide ran for just 23 yards on 17 carries for an average of 1.4 yards per carry, converting on three of 11 third-down opportunities.",

It usually does that only after a contract or memorandum of understanding is signed.\n\nJackson's position is unknown, but his background suggests it will be in the defensive front seven.\n\nIn 2025, Jackson served as a defensive analyst and assistant defensive line coach at Penn State, where he worked under Knowles.\n\nJackson was the defensive line coach at Fordham (2017), Old Dominion (2020) and West Virginia (2021-24). He was a defensive quality control coach at Mississippi State (2018) and defensive tackles coach at James Madison (2019). And he was also a Penn State defensive line graduate assistant (2015-16).\n\nJackson worked under Knowles at Penn State in the 2025 season. In December, Tennessee coach Josh Heupel hired Knowles to replace fired defensive coordinator Tim Banks.\n\nTennessee currently has three position coaches in the front seven of the defense. Defensive line coach Rodney Garner's contract expires Jan. 31, 2026, but he is expected to sign an extension. Outside linebackers/edge rushers coach Levorn \"Chop\" Harbin and linebacker coach William Inge each have a contract through January 2027.\n\nBut UT also has an extensive staff of analysts, so Jackson could fill a role there, as well.\n\nAdam Sparks is the Tennessee football beat reporter.

(AP) — Alabama rallied from a 17-point deficit once in the College Football Playoff, but there would not be a repeat performance against No. 1 Indiana in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Crimson Tide tried everything possible to stage a historic comeback on the site of so many memorable moments for the program, from a 1926 win that marked the arrival of southern football as a powerhouse on par with the rest of the country, to a 2024 overtime loss that would be legendary head coach Nick Saban's final game, but not even benching star quarterback Ty Simpson in the second half could provide a spark in a 38-3 loss to the Hoosiers.\n\nThe cracks that had been evident throughout a tumultuous season, from the shock opening loss to Florida State that only got worse as the year went on to why Alabama (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) found itself trailing by three scores against Oklahoma in the first round on Dec. 19, finally brought the inevitable conclusion for a talented, but flawed, team.\n\nWithout the benefit of any semblance of a running game, Simpson struggled to create big plays against Indiana's stout defense, going 12 of 16 for 67 yards and running for 17 yards with a lost fumble. The desperation to keep up with Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza had Alabama going for it on fourth down from its own 34 early in the second quarter, leading to an odd Wildcat pop pass that was stopped short.\n\nAustin Mack, who followed head coach Kalen DeBoer from Washington to Alabama before the 2024 season, took over late in the third quarter and managed a field goal on his first drive. That was as much as the third-year sophomore could muster, ending up 11 of 16 for 103 yards with three sacks.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe nature of the College Football Playoff is to pin the best teams in the country against one another, allowing debates over the best squad to be settled in the race for a national championship.\n\nWith 136 FBS teams, the selection process for the CFP can be controversial, but for the most part, only the elite teams wind up competing in the playoff bracket. Every once in a while though, that doesn't matter much, as a CFP matchup becomes a one-sided affair.\n\nFrom the 2023 national championship game, to some lighter first-round opponents in the first-ever 12-team CFP in 2024, there have been some significant blowouts in the history of college football's postseason.\n\nHere are the 13 biggest blowouts in the history of the College Football Playoff.\n\nMORE: How every Heisman Trophy winner fared in the NFL\n\nThe biggest blowout in CFP history came in a title game, as in 2023, Georgia bludgeoned TCU 65-7 to win the national championship. While the Horned Frogs had made the game by beating Michigan 51-45 in the semifinal, they found no such luck against the Bulldogs.\n\nThe 58-point victory for Georgia wasn't just the most lopsided win in a CFP title game; it marked the biggest win in any title game, and at the time, it was the largest margin of victory in any bowl game at the FBS level.\n\nAs the Bulldogs repeated as the champions and completed a 15-0 season, Stetson Bennett threw for 304 yards and four touchdowns, adding another two scores on the ground. Branson Robinson scored twice on the ground, Kendall Milton had a rushing touchdown, Ladd McConkey caught two touchdowns and Brock Bowers and Adonai Mitchell both caught one pass in the end zone — all while TCU scored just one first-quarter touchdown.\n\nMORE: Revisiting the infamous Uga-Bevo attack video with Texas and Georgia\n\nFinal Score: Oregon 59, Florida State 20\n\nA Pac-12-ACC matchup came in the 2015 Rose Bowl, as second-seeded Oregon took on third-seeded Florida State in Pasadena. Unfortunately for the Seminoles, the CFP semifinal game was all Ducks.\n\nOregon beat the defending national champs 59-20, advancing to the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship Game. In the game, the Ducks totaled 639 total yards, including 301 rushing, breaking the record for the most points (59) scored in a Rose Bowl.\n\nMarcus Mariota had 338 passing yards, two touchdown passes, one interception and a rushing touchdown in the win, while Thomas Tyner and Royce Freeman added four more scores on the ground. The Ducks went on to fall by 22 points to Ohio State in the championship.\n\nMORE:Complete history of Lee Corso's College GameDay headgear picks\n\nFinal Score: Alabama 38, Michigan State 0\n\nAlabama was an established powerhouse under Nick Saban by 2015, and he continued flexing his coaching muscles in that year's College Football Playoff. Matched up against Michigan State in the semifinal, the Crimson Tide made light work of the Spartans.\n\nWhile most of Alabama's work was done in the second half, including Jake Coker's two touchdown passes to Calvin Ridley. Derrick Henry was his typical dominant self as well, running for 75 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAlabama picked off MSU quarterback Connor Cook twice, controlling the game from start to finish as it advanced to the title game.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 16 greatest Alabama players of all time\n\nFinal Score: LSU 63, Oklahoma 28\n\nThere's a reason the 2019 LSU Tigers are considered one of the best teams in college football history. In their semifinal playoff game, the Tigers exploded for 63 points against the country's fourth-ranked team, Oklahoma.\n\nEven by the end of the first quarter, LSU led 21-7, and by halftime, it was 49-14. The Sooners simply could not contain Joe Burrow and Ed Orgeron's offense; on the day, Burrow had 493 passing yards and an unreal seven touchdown passes, tying the NCAA records for touchdown passes in a half and touchdown passes in a bowl game. Burrow also ran for an eighth touchdown.\n\nJustin Jefferson caught four of Burrow's touchdowns, setting a College Football Playoff record, Terrace Marshall Jr. had two and Thaddeus Moss had another.\n\nMORE: Most NFL Draft picks by a school in one year\n\nFinal Score: Indiana 38, Alabama 3\n\nTo open their 2026 College Football Playoff run, Indiana, one of the all-time worst football programs in college football history, was tasked with one of the best all-time programs: Alabama. History didn't matter very much in the CFP quarterfinal game.\n\nIndiana stampeded through Alabama, 38-3, stymying Kalen DeBoer's offense all day while Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes. The Hoosiers advanced to the semifinal with the victory, becoming the title favorite with defending champion Ohio State's loss.\n\nAlabama totaled just three points all day in the 2026 Rose Bowl for one of the biggest playoff blowouts ever.\n\nMORE: Where Indiana ranks among all-time losing CFB programs\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 31, Ohio State 0\n\nThere's only two shutouts on this list of CFP blowouts, and one came in 2016, when Clemson decimated Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl, which was a playoff semifinal game.\n\nUrban Meyer coached his unit to a 31-0 win, scoring in all four quarters while his defense didn't allow a single point to the Buckeyes. Despite Deshaun Watson's two interceptions, he also ran for two scores and threw for another.\n\nOhio State registered just nine first-downs all night, with quarterback J.T. Barrett throwing a pair of interceptions as Clemson moved onto the championship.\n\nMORE:The 7 biggest national championship upsets ever\n\nFinal Score: Ole Miss 41, Tulane 10\n\nTulane had a hard time keeping up with Ole Miss in the first round of the playoff in 2025, letting up two quick touchdown drives to start the game and only finding the end zone once in a 41-10 loss.\n\nThe Green Wave actually racked up more than 400 yards of offense, but they struggled to finish drives, turned the ball over three times and slipped up again defensively in the second half after a promising finish to the first half.\n\nOle Miss totaled 497 yards of offense in the win, including 346 passing yards with Trinidad Chambliss in full command.\n\nFinal Score: Penn State 38, SMU 10\n\nIn the first year of the 12-team CFP, Penn State earned the right to host a first-round game in Beaver Stadium, and the opposing environment did not go well for the SMU Mustangs. They were blown out, 38-10, as the Nittany Lions moved onto the quarterfinals.\n\nPenn State's first offensive score didn't come until the five-minute mark of the second quarter, but James Franklin's team was already up multiple scored by then — SMU quarterback Kevin Jennings threw two pick-sixes in the first half.\n\nThe Mustangs didn't find the end zone until the fourth quarter, and even on a day where quarterback Drew Allar had just 127 yards and no touchdowns, Penn State rolled to a CFP win.\n\nMORE: How Penn State's 'White Out' became an annual tradition\n\nFinal Score: Alabama 52, Ohio State 24\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide capped a perfect season with a huge win over Ohio State in the 2021 CFP championship, scoring 35 points in the first half alone to coast against the Buckeyes.\n\nAll night, the Crimson Tide offense was on fire — quarterback Mac Jones threw for 464 yards and five touchdown passes, running back Najee Harris scored three times, and Heisman Trophy winning-receiver Devonta Smith took his 12 catches for 215 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe Buckeyes were playing keep-up from the start, and Alabama won yet another national title under Nick Saban.\n\nMORE: Revisiting Alabama's loaded 2015 coaching staff\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 44, Alabama 16\n\nAlabama came into the 2019 title game as the No. 1-ranked team, but the final score said otherwise. The second-ranked Clemson Tigers had no issues en route to a 15-0 record and national title, winning by 28 points.\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a clean 347 passing yards and three touchdown passes, which went to Justyn Ross, Tee Higgins and Travis Etienne, who also scored twice on the ground. Dabo Swinney's squad used 17 second-quarter points to build its advantage.\n\nClemson won its second national title in three years with its blowout win.\n\nMORE: Where is Clemson located?\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 30, Notre Dame 3\n\nIn a CFP semifinal game, Clemson came in and routed Notre Dame in the 2018 Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Texas. The Tigers, who also went on to blow out Alabama in the championship game, walked away with a dominant 30-3 win over the Fighting Irish.\n\nClemson entered with a 13-0 record behind quarterback Trevor Lawrence, and even a suspension for three players, including starting defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, coming into the game didn't slow the Tigers down.\n\nOf Clemson's 30 points, 27 went unanswered from the first-quarter on. Lawrence threw touchdown passes to Justyn Ross (2) and Tee Higgins, then Travis Etienne put a cap on the win with a 62-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.\n\nMORE: Why are LSU and Clemson both called 'Death Valley'?\n\nFinal Score: Ohio State 42, Tennessee 17\n\nIn hindsight, the fact that Ohio State was the No. 9 seed in the 2024 College Football Playoff bracket looks laughable, but the eventual-champion Buckeyes faced significant questions coming onto the playoff after losing their regular-season finale to Michigan.\n\nHowever, Ryan Day's unit came out and dominated to open the CFP, cruising to a 21-0 start in the first quarter against Josh Huepel's Tennessee squad.\n\nThe Buckeyes advanced to the quarterfinals with a 42-17 win as quarterback Will Howard threw for 311 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, freshman phenom Jeremiah Smith caught two touchdown passes with 103 yards, and running backs TreVeyson Henderson and Quinshon Judkins both scored twice.\n\nMORE: The history of Ohio State coaches' records vs. Michigan\n\nFinal Score: Georgia 34, Michigan 11\n\nAt the 2021 Orange Bowl, Georgia met Michigan for one of the two CFP semifinal games.

    "fullText": "After a night of rain in Pasadena, the Indiana Hoosiers washed away the weight of history.\n\nEntering the Rose Bowl, College Football Playoff teams coming off first-round byes were winless. At the start of the season, the Hoosiers led college football with the most all-time losses. During their sole previous Rose Bowl appearance in 1968, the Hoosiers lost to USC.\n\nIndiana’s football program spent most of its time stuck in the Big Ten conference basement, but that era is over.\n\nNow, with new blood infused by head coach Curt Cignetti and an offense led by Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, the Hoosiers have turned the page and shattered expectations.\n\nAfter a quarter of brushing off their rust following a three-week break, No. 1 Indiana rolled to a 38-3 Rose Bowl victory over No. 9 Alabama Thursday afternoon in front of a crowd of 90,278. It is the largest postseason margin of defeat in Crimson Tide history.\n\n\"We've come through in clutch moments,\" Cignetti said during his ESPN postgame interview. \"I'm proud of the way they've responded.\"\n\nIndiana scored its first touchdown on a 21-yard pass from Mendoza to Charlie Becker to make it 10-0. It was the first touchdown scored by a Hoosier at the Rose Bowl in program history, the perfect way to establish Indiana’s domination.\n\nIndiana’s defense established its dominance during a pivotal stretch in the second quarter when Alabama could not afford to let the Hoosiers stretch their lead.\n\nFacing fourth-and-one at the Alabama 34, Indiana coach Curt Cignetti called timeout when it was clear the Tide were in a trick play formation. After the timeout, Alabama tried to get the Indiana defense to jump offsides but couldn’t get a penalty and burned a timeout of its own. The teams lined up one more time on fourth down, with Crimson Tide running back Daniel Hill passing to receiver Germie Bernard. Indiana’s Isaiah Jones and Rolijah Hardy combined to stuff Bernand for no gain and a game-defining turnover on downs.\n\nHoosiers fans celebrated the early success after taking over the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day. The sea of cherry red fans planted their flag and made themselves heard. Any time the word Alabama was mentioned, Indiana fans booed and asserted homefield advantage. With the skies clearing after a morning of heavy rain, Hoosiers joyously broke out “Who’s your daddy?” chants.\n\nCignetti kept taking jabs at the Tide defense with heavy use of the run game early in the contest. When it was his turn to pass, Mendoza was nearly perfect. He finished 14 of 16 passing for 192 yards and three touchdowns. He was sacked three times, but Mendoza never turned the ball over.\n\nMendoza contributed to the strong Indiana run game, frustrating the gashed Tide defense. With all his receivers covered, he scrambled for a back-breaking eight-yard run in the third quarter to tighten Indiana’s control of the game.\n\nThe following play, Mendoza threw a 24-yard touchdown to Elijah Sarrat to make it 24-0. He finished with 38 rushing yards.\n\nEntering the game, Indiana wanted to contain Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson. He gave up a critical first-half fumble and struggled to find seams in the Indiana defense. Tide coach Kalen DeBoer eventually benched Simpson, who had been limited by injuries part of this season, at halftime.\n\nCrimson Tide second-string quarterback Austin Mack finished the game with 103 passing yards. Simpson finished the game with 67. Mack threw a 34-yard pass to Bernard in the third quarter, which led to a 28-yard field goal that made the score 24-3.\n\nThe Hoosiers tacked on a Kaelon Black 25-yard rushing touchdown to make it 31-3. He finished the game with 99 yards and one touchdown.\n\nAs clouds dissipated, the Hoosiers booked their ticket to the Peach Bowl, where they will face Oregon in their pursuit of the ultimate team award – the national championship.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Quarterback Lamar Jackson shared his status for the Steelers-Ravens Week 18 game.",
    "fullText": "Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson will play in Week 18 against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a win-or-go-home game.\n\n\"I'm gonna be out there,\" Jackson said.\n\nThis poses a greater challenge for the Steelers' defense, as the two-time MVP is a dynamic quarterback.\n\nIn their first matchup, Pittsburgh did a good job of limiting Jackson, as he completed 19 of 35 passes for 219 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He also rushed for 43 yards and a touchdown on seven carries.\n\nThe Steelers will need another effective defensive performance against the Ravens. Pittsburgh needs to force Baltimore to pass the ball.\n\nIn that game, the Ravens had a strong rushing attack, as Derrick Henry ran for 94 yards on 25 carries and Keaton Mitchell added 76 yards on six carries.\n\nThe Steelers' defense limited Baltimore's passing attack, and that could be crucial if they can force Jackson into must-pass situations.\n\nHowever, a lot will hinge on the effectiveness of Pittsburgh's offense. The Steelers will be without star wide receiver DK Metcalf, who is serving the final game of his suspension.\n\nIn the first game against Pittsburgh, Metcalf had a monster game, hauling in seven receptions for 148 yards. On the season, Metcalf has 59 receptions for 850 yards and six touchdowns.\n\nPittsburgh will also be without another one of their top weapons in tight end Darnell Washington, as he suffered a broken arm. On the season, Washington had 31 receptions for 364 yards and a touchdown.\n\nWithout Metcalf and Washington, the Steelers will need wide receivers Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Adam Thielen to step up, as well as tight end Pat Freiermuth.\n\nThe Steelers' offense struggled in Week 17 against the Cleveland Browns, as they didn't have a reliable weapon for Aaron Rodgers to target.\n\nAgainst the Ravens, they will need to establish the run game with Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell to open up the passing attack. In their first game, the rushing attack was ineffective, as Warren rushed for 13 yards on eight carries and Gainwell had 15 yards and a touchdown on four carries.\n\nThe Steelers will have a tough battle against the Ravens in Week 18 for the AFC North title and a spot in the postseason, and it will be even more challenging with Jackson playing.",

All Allen has to do is play the first snap of the game to extend the streak.\n\nThat's what he did last season, taking the field for the opening snap before trotting off the field with a smile on his face.\n\nIt seems safe to expect Allen to do that again this year.\n\nThe Bills certainly need to prioritize Allen's health for the playoffs, and it appears that's what they're doing.\n\nIf they can extend his streak in a foolproof way in the process, all the better.\n\nDrake Maye has one issue that could stop Patriots from winning Super Bowl\n\nMicah Parsons' injury has crushed the Packers in a very specific way\n\nJalen Hurts has a big problem, and it's not what it used to be\n\nPuka Nacua made the best non-catch you've ever seen\n\nPope Leo XIV gives the Seahawks a good omen\n\nThis viral Josh Allen highlight from Wyoming is crazy",

    "fullText": "South Carolina WR Vandrevius Jacobs plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, per On3’s Pete Nakos. Jacobs was the Gamecocks second-leading receiver in 2025.\n\nHis 32 receptions led South Carolina receivers this season, and totaled 548 yards and four touchdowns as a result. On his career, Jacobs has caught 47 passes for 789 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nJacobs had three 100+ yard performances during the 2025 season. This included matchups vs. Missouri (128 yards, TD), Kentucky (108 yards) and Clemson (141 yards, TD). His performance against Clemson was a career best.\n\nBefore college, Jacobs was a four-star recruit in the 2024 recruiting class per the Rivals Industry Rankings, which is a proprietary algorithm that compiles ratings and rankings from all four primary recruiting media services. He was the No. 338 overall recruit and No. 52 overall player at his position.\n\nHis decision comes after South Carolina’s No. 1 WR in 2025, Nyck Harbor, announced that he’ll be returning to Columbia in 2026.\n\n“You really thought I was going somewhere? Nah,” Harbor said in a video he posted on social media. “Eight’s running it back. Let’s do it.”\n\nAdditionally, QB LaNorris Sellers announced his plan to return to South Carolina next season. The two will provide what’ll be expected to be one of the most exciting duos in the SEC in 2026. Many placed high expectations on Sellers ahead of the 2025 season and while that didn’t pan out the way many believed the would, Sellers will use the 2026 to regain that type ahead of his redshirt junior season.\n\nSouth Carolina finished the season with a 4-8 record, missing out on a bowl game for the second time in three seasons under head coach Shane Beamer. This comes after the Gamecocks broke out for nine wins in 2024. Their strong finish to the year led to South Carolina ranked 13th in the preseason AP Poll and were ranked as high as No. 10 before losing six of their last seven games.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

    "fullText": "On Thursday afternoon, the Alabama Crimson Tide were back in action to play in a must-win game, doing so against the Indiana Hoosiers in the CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl.\n\nWith a trip to the CFP semifinal at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on the line, it was Indiana who secured a victory out in Pasadena, defeating Alabama in blowout fashion, 38-3.\n\nSimply put, this was one of the worst bowl performances in recent memory for the Crimson Tide, one that included a 407-193 total yardage deficit for Alabama against the No. 1 overall seeded Hoosiers.\n\nFollowing are some instant reactions to Alabama's loss against Indiana in the CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl.\n\nOne of the biggest stories from Alabama's loss to Indiana was the performance of the Crimson Tide on both sides of the ball on third down. Offensively, Alabama was held to 3-of-11 on third downs, as well as 0-2 on fourth, while the Crimson Tide defense also struggled, allowing Indiana to convert 9-of-14 attempts.\n\nSimilar to the first round against Oklahoma, Alabama fell behind early on by a sizable margin, but this was a first half deficit the Crimson Tide could not overcome. Alabama turned the ball over on downs, as well as fumbled the ball, in the first half, both of which led to Indiana touchdowns to help build a 17-0 edge at halftime.\n\nWhile the Crimson Tide posted three sacks, Indiana's Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza had a big day against the Alabama defense. In all, Mendoza completed 14-of-16 passes for 192 yards and three scores, while also rushing for 16 yards on eight attempts.\n\nAlabama made a quarterback change in the third quarter following an injury to Ty Simpson, with Austin Mack playing a majority of the second half. Mack ended up completing 11-of-16 passes for 103 yards during the second half.\n\nAs a result of the Crimson Tide's loss in the Rose Bowl, Alabama's season comes to an end in the CFP quarterfinal round with an 11-4 overall record. Indiana will advance to face No. 5 seeded Oregon in the CFP semifinals.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama football instant reactions to Rose Bowl loss vs. Indiana",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlabama’s 38-3 loss to Indiana in the Rose Bowl wasn’t just a defeat, but a historical anomaly that highlighted how far the Crimson Tide fell on college football’s biggest stage.\n\nThe setback marked the worst margin of defeat for the Alabama Crimson Tide in more than two decades. No Alabama team in the past 20 seasons had lost by 30 points, a reflection of the standard established during Nick Saban’s tenure. For first-year coach Kalen DeBoer, it was the most one-sided loss of his time in Tuscaloosa and the program’s worst showing since a 42-6 defeat to Arkansas on Sept. 26, 1998.\n\nBeing held to three points placed Alabama in rare and uncomfortable territory. The Tide had not failed to score a touchdown since the 9-6 overtime loss to LSU in the 2011 “Game of the Century.” More recently, a 24-3 loss at Oklahoma in 2024 ended a long touchdown streak, but the Rose Bowl result went even further. The 35-point margin surpassed the 44-16 loss to Clemson in the 2018 national championship game as the program’s most jarring modern-era defeat.\n\nIndiana left no doubt it belonged. Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza delivered one of the most efficient post-Heisman performances in recent memory, completing 14 of 16 passes for 192 yards and three touchdowns as the Hoosiers controlled the game from start to finish.\n\nThe outcome also intensified scrutiny on DeBoer after a week spent deflecting rumors about the Michigan opening. He now heads into the offseason facing questions about Alabama’s direction.\n\nFor Curt Cignetti and the Indiana Hoosiers, the night was historic.

    "fullText": "While many of the headlines lately seem to be about players making the decisions to explore their options in the transfer portal, Penn State and new head coach Matt Campbell got a bit of big news from one of the top defensive players on the roster. Linebacker Tony Rojas announced he will be staying in Happy Valley in 2026.\n\nRojas shared his announcement to return wiht a post on his Instagram account on Thursday, putting an end to any speculation that he may explore some transfer opportunities this offseason.\n\n\"The past three seasons have been an incredible ride with a lot of historic moments and lifetime memories I will be able to hold on to,\" Rojas said in his statement. \"But as we all know, this season has been nothing but a roller coaster and I was in disbelief and hurt when I went down. I felt like I let myself down and most importantly my teammates down.\n\n\"With that being said, after lots of talks with my family and close ones, I will be returning to Penn State for my senior year,\" Rojas confirmed. \"I'm ready to finish what me and my teammates started and am ready to flip this thing and tell an incredible story with Coach Campbell and his new staff.\"\n\nRojas was one of the rising stars on the defense since his arrival with the program but he suffered what turned out to be a season-ending injury during the 2025 season. His loss from the roster fell in line with the rapid decline of Penn State's season with UCLA being the first team to take full advantage of a Rojas-less Penn State defense. Penn State went on to lose the next four games after that UCLA loss (Northwestern, Iowa, Ohio State, and Indiana) as the defense worked to fix some concerns it had.\n\nPenn State does have a few linebackers choosing to enter the transfer portal, likely resulting in their pending departure from the program. Karui Jackson, Keon Wylie, and Anthony Speca have all reportedly entered the transfer portal.\n\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Penn State LB Tony Rojas announces decision for 2026",

    "description": "A deeper look with @iamcogs at Caleb Williams’ and the Chicago Bears’ 38-42 loss against the San Francisco 49ers",
    "fullText": "Note: Due to unforeseen New Years plans, play reviews won’t be done this week. I will be doing a deep dive into play reviews next week to make up for the lack of them the last two weeks!\n\nFirst and foremost: Happy New Years to all of you Windy City Gridiron faithful! I hope 2026 brings you all the happiness and blessings you deserve!\n\nI don’t think any Bears loss has made me feel as inspired as the loss we had on Sunday Night Football against the San Francisco 49ers last week.\n\nThat’s a weird thing to say, thinking about it, but bear with me.\n\nThere have been many Bears games in the past where our defense just wasn’t on it’s A game, and the opposing teams’ offense boat races us. Take for example the 2014 Chicago Bears. After suffering a crushing 51-23 loss to the Tom Brady led New England Patriots, the Bears, coming out of a bye week, gave up an astounding 55 to rival Green Bay, a game in which the Packers went into halftime with a 42-0 lead.\n\nWhile this is an example taken from perhaps the worst Bears defense ever fielded, there’s some parallels. We were a respectable to good offense during the Trestman era, (perhaps more so in 2013) the Bears defense struggled to stop teams from scoring, and in my cases that offense could not keep up.\n\nOn Sunday night that wasn’t the case.\n\nEach time the 49ers swung, we swung back, even taking a late lead with a 29-yard Cairo Santos field goal. It came down to the final play, but the Bears would fall short to the 49ers 38-42, on a disjointed play due in part to the play call coming in late.\n\nThe Bears offense went blow for blow, on the road, in a playoff atmosphere, against a premiere NFC opponent, and it came down to the last play. And a lot of that is due in part to Bears quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nWilliams shined on primetime, completing 25 of 42 passes for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and a 100.3 Passer Rating (125.7 TPR). He was absolute money when his team was behind all night, and he connected on deep balls over and over again, hitting on all 4 of his deep attempts for 130 yards, 2 touchdown and a perfect 158.3 Passer Rating (for a little fun, that’s a 608.8 on the TPR model!)\n\nAnd this isn’t just a one off thing, if you’ve been following the series you know he’s been steadily playing his best football of his career, in fact his numbers over the last 10 weeks are stellar, and some of his season long numbers have been incredible too.\n\nOver those last 10 weeks:\n71.0% On-Target%\n(LOS: 89.8% | S: 76.1% | M: 58.0% | D: 59.0%)\n2,655 Tot Yards (265.5/game)\n16 Tot TD (3.7% TD%)\n4 Tot Turnovers (0.9% Turnover%)\n12 Sacks (3.3% Sack%)\n9.3 ADOT\n21 Dropped Passes\n8.6% Big Play % | 1.6% Turnover Worthy %\n\nLocked in. https://t.co/gdKGQelzoN\n\n— Grim Cutty (@iamcogs) December 31, 2025\n\nA big play quarterback, with elite level sack avoidance and mobility, who also refuses to turn the ball over is a rare blend of quarterback that us Bears fans have never seen under center.\n\nSo often when it came to prime time I always had extreme levels of Bears related anxiety when it comes to how our quarterback plays. But in 5 prime time games this season, Williams completed 99/176 passes for 1,196 yards, 7 touchdowns and just 1 interception.\n\nI’m so excited to say this, but I’m ready to: We’ve found a franchise quarterback, and it’s going to be a very fun decade of Bears football.\n\n(Totals and averages are all before week 17: Season totals are underlined, Season averages in Italics)\n\nC/A: 285/493 (57.8%) | 19/32.9 (57.8%) | 25/42 (59.5%)\n\nQB at Fault Sacks: 13 | 0.9 | 0\n\nTrue Passer Rating: 126.0 | 125.7\n\nTime to Pressure: 2.64s | 3.11s\n\nPoor Play Rate / Big Play Rate: 9.6% PPR / 7.7% BPR | 2.1% PPR / 10.4% BRP\n\nThe full grading sheet for each play can be found here.\n\nNFL Passer Rating / True Passer Rating / PFF Grade: 100.3 / 125.7 / 71.8\n\nThe average passer rating in the 2025 season sits at 92.3 through week 17. His 100.3 NFL Passer Rating would be considered a good game.\n\nA 125.7 TPR is a solid Good game boarding on great, with 100 serving as the baseline for “Average.”\n\nOn the PFF scale, a score of 70 or higher is considered an Above Average game. With a 71.8, Caleb Williams’ performance was graded as a lower end Above Average game.\n\nPFF’s score is honestly underselling his performance this week, in my opinion. I pointed it out in a tweet earlier this week where Bo Nix was graded higher on the week than Williams, despite a much less impressive performance.\n\nOn-Target Throws: Season Average: 66.2% | Week 17 vs. 49ers: 76.5%\n\nReminder: Completion % ≠ On-Target %. On-target throws are only counted on aimed passes, so throw aways, spikes, and deflections at the line aren’t counted. And drops are counted as on-target.\n\nShort-Level Passing (Behind LOS – 9 yards): 21/26 | 80.8% On-Target\n\nDeep-Level Passing (10–20+ yards): 5/8 | 62.5% On-Target\n\nHis On-Target throwing has improved leaps and bounds. In the first 6 weeks of the season he was sitting at just 59.1%, but over the last 10 weeks his On-Target % is at 71.0%, with each and every one of those 10 games being above his season average On-Target rate. Very obvious and quantifiable growth!\n\n2.1% Poor Play Rate (turnover-worthy + poorly graded plays) against a 10.4% Big Play Rate (great + elite graded plays)\n\nI keep repeating myself here, but this is another week of positive trending when it comes to being under his season mark of PPR and being over his season mark on BPR.\n\nHow about that free play touchdown to Colston Loveland? It’s intangibles like that, that make me excited over the future of this kid.\n\nOver the last 3 weeks his big play rate has exploded, sitting at 8.6%, which is nearly double his season mark of 4.8%.\n\nTime to Throw: We saw a good mix of play-action and pocket passing this week, once again, putting his time to throw charted by me at 2.95 seconds.\n\nPer PFF his time to throw out of play-action last week was 3.75 seconds\n\nNo play-action time to throw sat at 3.03 seconds.\n\nIceman Cometh: The Bears spent a good portion of the game trailing, but Caleb Williams didn’t miss a beat, throwing for 257-yards, 2 touchdowns, and an adjusted 75.0% completion %. Just more proof that when the game is in peril, QB1 delivers.\n\nHis final scores in week 17 of 1st Half (1.05) / 2nd Half (3.95) / Game (5.00) give him another solid “Good” game grade on the season. His 4th game of the season with a “Good” or better grade, he also only has 3 games all season that graded below the score of “Average” (Week 1 vs. MIN, Week 6 @ WAS, Week 12 vs. PIT.) Of the 7 quarterbacks I grade, only Drake Maye has had more Good or better games (7).\n\nOf the seven quarterbacks I grade (with the slight caveat of 3 of those quarterbacks are injured) Williams placed 1st this week, as he continues an extremely impressive back-end performance to the 2025 season.\n\nWeekly scores of every QB I grade can be found here.\n\nThe Bears come back home for the final week of a the 2025 NFL regular season. Crazy to think this season has flown by as fast as it has. The Bears have a few things on the line, a win would lock up the #2 seed in the playoff’s ensuring 2 playoff home games (if they handle business in the wildcard round.) Caleb Williams is also 109 yards away from breaking the Chicago Bears single season passing yardage record held by Erik Kramer, and is 270 yards away from being the franchises first 4,000 yard passer. I predict that he will, in fact, do just that against the Lions at home.\n\nAs always, Bear Down, and we will see you back here next week!\n\nGary Baugher Jr. is a rookie contributor to WCG, bringing football insight backed by over 16 years of experience in organized football and more than 30 years as a passionate fan of the game.

(AP) — No. 1 Indiana became the first team in the brief history of the 12-team College Football Playoff to win a game after receiving a first-round bye, smothering Alabama 38-3 in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Hoosiers (14-0; No. 1 AP, No. 1 CFP) ended a six-game losing streak for teams coming off an extended layoff, including second seed Ohio State falling to Miami in the Cotton Bowl on Wednesday and fourth seed Texas Tech being shutout by Oregon in the Orange Bowl earlier on Thursday.\n\nAn inauspicious start made it seem as if Indiana might continue the trend of teams unable to respond after a long layoff, going three-and-out on the opening possession with Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza taking two sacks. The Crimson Tide (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) then found early success with two quick first downs into Hoosiers’ territory before the defense stepped up to force a punt.\n\nFrom there, Indiana came to life, taking a 17-0 halftime lead on a 31-yard field goal by Nicolas Radicic and two touchdown passes from Mendoza. Avoiding an early deficit was crucial, as it had been something of a constant in the previous losses by idle teams.\n\nThe Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-0 hole at the break against the Hurricanes, and the Red Raiders allowed 104 yards to the Ducks while gaining minus-2 yards in the first quarter. In last year's Granddaddy of Them All, Oregon gave up the first 34 points in a 41-21 loss to eventual national champion Ohio State.\n\nNot spotting Alabama an early advantage allowed Indiana to continue playing to its strengths and eventually wear down the SEC at-large participant.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "When a club as big as Bayern Munich does anything, it’s bound to gather attention from the media. Now imagine when the German side do something significantly positive or, even worse, negative. Disaster. Any and every shortcoming Bayern endure is put under the microscope for the unforgiving media to scrutinize.\n\nTake Bayern’s failed attempt to sign Florian Wirtz. The failed transfer signaled a media rampage, ultimately writing Bayern off as a desirable destination for top players without a single minute of the 2025/26 season being played. One signing of Luis Díaz and a few months later, Bayern are the talk of the town across Europe, perhaps even the favorite to win the Champions League. From one end of the pendulum to the other. That’s how quickly things change at Bayern.\n\nOne thing that remains consistent no matter what, is the media. However positive or negative, the white noise doesn’t seem to bother Bayern sporting director, Christoph Freund.\n\n“There’s always a lot going on around FC Bayern,” explained Freund in an interview with Servus Nachrichten (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “So much is being written and so many rumors. The club is just so big and interesting. If a transfer somehow doesn’t work out, then it’s obviously a huge topic. But we’ve always said that we don’t have to do much with our squad. When our injured players come back, we’ll have a really good team. The club hasn’t lost any of its appeal. When something is reported, whether positive or negative, it’s always about FC Bayern Munich. That’s a brand, and it’s a huge one.”\n\nAfter decades of being at the very pinnacle of Europe’s elite, Die Rekordmeister are primed to deal with the media. While headlines and criticism may trigger fans, it’s just another day in the office for Bayern.",

He started his career at West Virginia and redshirted his first year in the sport. Trotter was a freshman All-American for the Mountaineers in 2024 before transferring to Mizzou.\n\nInstead, he’ll go through the draft process, and all indications suggest he will be a top-100 prospect this year.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Mizzou learned that fellow third-year and potential NFL Draft entrant Cayden Green will not declare for the draft and instead will return to Columbia in 2026.\n\nAll Glory to God pic.twitter.com/LB5N0p9DEv\n\n— Josiah Trotter (@TrotterJosiah) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Tigers are now waiting on a decision from one final third-year player: defensive end Damon Wilson II, who can stay or declare for the draft.\n\nTrotter was Mizzou’s leading tackler in his lone season in Columbia, racking up 84 total tackles, which included 13 hits behind the line of scrimmage and two sacks.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Trotter as the third-best run-stopping linebacker in the Southeastern Conference and as a top-five pass-rushing LB in the league.\n\nHe has significant professional pedigree in his family.\n\nHis father, Jeremiah Trotter Sr., was a four-time Pro Bowler and Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer who spent more than a decade in the league.\n\nJosiah Trotter’s older brother, Jeremiah Trotter Jr., was on the Eagles roster than won the Super Bowl last season.\n\nMock Draft Database has Trotter listed at No. 107 on its consensus big board for the 2026 draft, which is a fourth-round slot. It would not be a surprise to see the 6-foot-2, 237-pound linebacker climb higher as he goes through the NFL Scouting Combine and Pro Day.\n\nIt’s a significant loss for Mizzou’s defense.\n\nThe Tigers announced earlier Thursday that standout sophomore Nicholas Rodriguez will return in 2026. But, Mizzou is also set to lose two more players from its core, four-player rotation in Khalil Jacobs and Triston Newson to eligibility.\n\nThat means Missouri likely will be active in the transfer portal looking to fill those gaps.\n\nMore: Missouri football needs a QB for 2026.

    "fullText": "The term 'Stetson Bennett-esque' has been used to describe Gunner Stockton from time to time throughout his time as Georgia's starting quarterback.\n\nStockton himself told me ahead of the 2025 season that he sees a lot of who he is in Stetson Bennett. And it just so turns out that the the feeling is mutual.\n\nThe legendary former Georgia quarterback was highly complementary of Stockton and said he saw a lot of similarities in their journeys.\n\n\"I'd love to hear what he said about me,\" Bennett laughed to me following the Rams' 27-24 loss to the Falcons on Monday night. \"In terms of you saying he told you he thinks he has the same type of playing style and moxie as me, I totally agree. I love watching him and I'm one of the biggest fans of Georgia that there is.\"\n\nBennett lives and breathes Georgia. That much rang true in his decision to come to Georgia as a walk-on for a second time after going to Jones College, taking a chance against some of the toughest quarterback competition in the nation against then-Bobcats head coach Steve Buckley.\n\nThe rest is history as Bennett became perhaps the best college football player story of all-time. The quarterback still has the same sentiment toward Georgia, even if he's not able to watch the Bulldogs as much as he would like to at this point in his personal NFL journey.\n\n\"Saturdays are our traveling days, so I haven't gotten to watch as much of Georgia as I used to,\" Bennett said. \"But the little bit I've watched, I loved.\"\n\nBennett sees Georgia as the same gritty team he came from, with a story that echoes his own experience with the Bulldogs in some ways. Stockton has been a part of that, with Bennett saying the Tiger, Georgia native is among his favorite players to watch.\n\n\"They've gotten better as time has gone on and early in the season,\" Bennett said. \"They got battle tested but you see moments like that 4th & 6 pass Gunner threw against Tennessee. The scratching and fighting and clawing and figuring out a way to get it done when they had to.\"\n\nBennett will have his eyes closely locked on the Sugar Bowl matchup between Georgia and Ole Miss on Thursday evening. He couldn't be more confident in a quarterback who has been pinned by some as the next \"Stetson Bennett\" already.\n\n\"Just trying to go out there and do the best that you can for your team. It looks like Gunner has been doing that all year, and I can't wait to watch him continue doing that.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Draft Wire: Stetson Bennett 'totally agrees' with Gunner Stockton comparison",

    "title": "Notable quotes from Dan Lanning's presser after shutout vs. Texas Tech",
    "description": "Oregon Ducks head coach Dan Lanning met with media members to break down his team's win over the Texas Tech Red Raiders in the CFP Quarterfinals.",
    "fullText": "It may have taken an entire calendar year, but the Oregon Ducks finally exorcised their demons from last year with a win in the College Football Playoff Quarterfinals. They manhandled the Texas Tech Red Raiders in a 23-0 shutout, where the Big-12 champions’ top-10 offense was dismantled.\n\nDan Lanning was visibly frustrated with his team’s defense after their win in the first round of the playoffs, so it makes sense why the unit put together such an inspired performance. The same couldn’t be said for the offense, who only had 16 points total before a garbage-time touchdown inflated the stats slightly.\n\nWhile there are still things to improve upon, it should make the Ducks feel good that they can be so dominant while playing far below their potential. They are just two wins away from being immortalized as champions. Let’s look at what Lanning had to say about that prospect and the win today over Texas Tech.\n\nLanning: Unbelievable game. A lot of fun. We've talked to our guys about being battle tested all year and having to win in different ways. That game went back and forth in a lot of ways, struggled at times to go score points, and our defense did an unbelievable job getting the ball back. And then our offense showed up when it mattered most at the end of the game. I think we out-physicaled our opponent at the end. A lot of respect for Coach McGuire and the team that he's had. This shouldn't discredit them. I remember this feeling last year when you have a really good team, you play really good football all year, and then it comes to an end. And that's the way it is for every team but one. Certainly grateful for our fans and excited to see them show up in Atlanta.\n\nQ: What did you make of the hype surrounding Texas Tech’s defense before this game?\n\nLanning: Yeah, we thought they were. They are a good defense. Their performance today, I think it showed it. You walk into halftime, it's 6-0, that's a great indicator of them being a good defense. And they had some guys that played some really good ball. We just felt like in this moment it was going to be about chipping away and eventually it was going to break. It kind of broke open with us creating some extra opportunities there with takeaways, opportunities on special teams. I thought our special teams played really, really well.\n\nBut we had a lot of respect for Texas Tech's defense. They don't play the way they've played all year and not be good. And they are. They're good. We thought it would be about explosive plays. There weren't a ton of explosive plays in this game really for either side. But the physicality showed up for our guys down the stretch.\n\nQ: How were you able to shut down the Red Raiders’ passing attack?\n\nLanning: Definitely it starts with players like Brandon. I think Brandon would tell you the same thing. It's about 11 guys executing, and that's how you get an opportunity to create plays like that. I think when we pull up this film and we watch it, we're going to see 11 guys playing the same call. We knew their tempo would be an issue. So ultimately we wanted to be able to get the call in fast and let our guys line up. I thought we did a really good job of that.\n\nI thought Coach Lupoi did a great job of calling the game, and our defensive coaches preparing them. I felt like it was probably faster in practice than it was in the game, which is ultimately what we wanted. And then we knew their strengths. They've been really good at completing shots down the field. They've had a really good screen game. Those are things that we really prepared for and worked really hard for, and guys like Brandon showed up.\n\nQ: Can you speak about your mindset on going for it in fourth down?\n\nLanning: Well, it worked sometimes and didn't work sometimes. So I assume all the times it didn't work I'm stupid and all the times it worked I'm smart. That's kind of how it works. I feel like -- we talked about it at halftime. We made some adjustments. They were playing really good 4th down defense, and we decided, hey, let's take the points in the second half. But I think that's our mindset. We make those decisions early in the week, and I certainly trust our offense. They ran a really tough defensive call for what we called down there in the red area. That's one that you wish you had back, say we could have took the points there. But points are never guaranteed. We missed a field goal, too.\n\nBut I felt good about -- we had an early look on punt and felt like we were going to have a look at the punt fake. That was an opportunity to go be aggressive. And just felt like ultimately, if you limit the opportunities for their offense to be on the field, you were going to increase the opportunities for us to go score and them not to, and that showed up today.\n\nQ: What is the challenges of defending a player like David Bailey?\n\nLanning: They've got good players, man. They've got really good players. They've got a great front. Ultimately they rushed the passer really, really well. I'm excited to evaluate the film and say how can we shore that up. I think there's going to be some small things that we can attack and make better. There's some plays we were really efficient at today, and then there were some plays that weren't. When you have a player like David Bailey, when you have players that you're going to see in the College Football Playoff, you've got to have a plan for them. At times our plan was really good, and then there was some times that we could certainly improve that.\n\nQ: Can you speak about Brandon Finney Jr.’s interception in the end zone?\n\nLanning: It's a strategic play. He did it exactly like we asked him to do. We tell him to play low to high down in the red area. He did exactly that. He played low until the player was able to show up and take away the low and then he creeped to high, and he made an outstanding play. I was just as impressed with the fact took a knee after he caught it.\n\nQ: What are your thoughts on not having a first-round bye?\n\nLanning: I guess it works, right? I've been a proponent for games to be happening much quicker for a long time. I think that's best for college football. Again, I felt like this game -- the Orange Bowl, first off, was unbelievable. I should have really given kudos to the Orange Bowl because it's been a great experience, but it's not the same bowl experience anymore when you talk about playoffs. Our guys didn't leave the hotel. They had a mindset that we can celebrate when this thing is all over with and they were really focused, but the hospitality here was unbelievable.\n\nBut we're trying to serve two different purposes here, and this is a playoff. A playoff in my opinion should have been played in Lubbock, Texas. I've said that before. That's not because we wanted to go play in Lubbock; I certainly didn't. I'm glad we played here in Miami, and it was good prep for us, but last year very similar situation for us. I feel like that game should have been played in Eugene. There's a lot of people that do playoffs. I feel like the playoffs have looked a certain way for a long time, and we're trying to serve two purposes here. The amount of time in between games, obviously, is tough for teams. We experienced it last year.\n\nQ: What will the next 24 hours look like for your team after this win?\n\nLanning: Well, it's going to start with about a five-hour flight, five-and-a-half-hour flight, but we'll be watching film on the way back, start trying to evaluate the opponents that we could potentially play. Hopefully we get some wi-fi up there in the air and we can flip on a game and check it out. But it always starts with us. That's where we're going to go back and look at this game and say, okay, what did we do really well. Let's go to the doctor, let's figure out what kind of medicine we've got to take for the next game because I think that's always the greatest indicator of what you have to improve, when you start to analyze what you have in front of you. Then we'll have kind of a bonus day here tomorrow and then we'll hop right into a normal week prep, Sunday prep. I don't even know what day today is. Today is Saturday in my mind. But we'll get a bonus day, and then it'll be Sunday the next day.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Top quotes from Dan Lanning after CFP win vs. Texas Tech Red Raiders",

    "fullText": "What's next for Alabama? Explaining questions surrounding Kalen DeBoer, Ty Simpson and more in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlabama's 2025 season came to an anticlimactic end on Thursday afternoon. The Tide fell 38-3 to the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers, in one of the worst playoff appearances for Alabama in recent years.\n\nAlthough the Tide managed to beat Oklahoma in the first round, losing by 28 points in the quarterfinal puts a sour end to the year. The three points Alabama put up is the lowest output since in its six appearances in the CFP era.\n\nNow that the book is closed on Alabama's 2025-26 season, let's take a look at what's next for head coach Kalen Deboer, quarterback Ty Simpson and the rest of the Tide in 2026.\n\nMORE:Lowest scoring Alabama games in CFP history\n\nThat likely depends on what incumbent Ty Simpson decides to do. The signal-caller's season was cut short against Indiana in the Rose Bowl. After taking a big hit that forced a fumble late in the second quarter, Tide head coach Kalen DeBoer benched him.\n\nThe decision appeared to be at least partly medical, as early in the second half, ESPN sideline reporter Kris Budden reported that while Simpson was trying to warm up, coaches determined he was not healthy enough to return to the game.\n\nSimpson is a redshirt junior who backed up both Bryce Young and Jalen Milroe in Tuscaloosa. He is eligible for the 2026 NFL Draft and could declare. The NFL Mock Draft database projects Simpson as a first-round pick, going No. 20 overall to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nSimpson, who threw for 3,500 yards with 28 touchdowns and five interceptions this season, had a strong first year as a starter. You could make the case for him to go pro, but you also can’t blame him for returning to Tuscaloosa to get another full season under his belt and possibly improve his draft stock, which dipped due to his late-season struggles.\n\nIf Simpson does leave, the Tide have a few options at quarterback. His backup is Austin Mack, who initially played under DeBoer at Washington. The former 4-star quarterback prospect out of Folsom, Calif., originally signed with the Huskies' 2023 class before following DeBoer to Tuscaloosa. After Simpson’s injury, Mack had a modest debut, going 11-of-16 for 103 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.\n\nAlabama also has former 5-star quarterback Keelon Russell from its 2025 class, and the Tide signed 4-star quarterback Jeff Thomalia to its 2026 recruiting class.\n\nMORE:Why Alabama QB Ty Simpson was pulled from Rose Bowl\n\nAs of now, it appears that Williams will remain with the Tide. In the days leading up to the Rose Bowl, he told  AL.com that he's \"Alabama through and through.\" He added that he has \"no intentions of being anywhere else.\"\n\n\"I had a lot of ups, people considered last year, and just learning how to deal with those, and I've had a lot of downs, people considered this year, and I've learned how to deal with those,\" Williams told ESPN at media day before the Rose Bowl. \"Really just an opportunity to stay human and have empathy for others, because I've been through some things. It's been a blessing to go through all the ups, all the downs, all the arounds.\"\n\nWilliams being speculated to transfer isn't too much of a surprise. He had a breakout season as a true freshman in 2024, getting 48 receptions 865 yards with eight touchdowns last season. But in 2025, Williams finished with just 43 receptions for 643 yards and four touchdowns. The sophomore is second nationally in highest percentage of drops (14.3) with 10 on the season.\n\nMORE:Indiana, Curt Cignetti shred rest vs. rust narrative in Rose Bowl\n\nKalen DeBoer is in his second season with Alabama, compiling a 20-8 record with the Tide over two seasons.\n\nDespite the impressive record and a playoff appearance this season, it hasn't all been sunshine and roses with the head coach and Alabama fans from the jump. In fact, it's been a roller coaster. DeBoer appeared to be on the hot seat after Alabama’s 2024 finish, which came in just his first season at the helm. The Tide seemed on track for a College Football Playoff bid last season, with one-score losses to Vanderbilt and Tennessee entering late November.\n\nThat changed with an embarrassing 24-3 road loss to Oklahoma on Nov. 23, which knocked Alabama out of playoff contention. The Tide then fell 19-13 to Michigan in the ReliaQuest Bowl to finish 9-4. Alabama opened the 2025 season with a 31-17 Week 1 road loss to Florida State.\n\nDeBoer worked his way back into fans’ good graces as the season progressed. Alabama beat then-No. 5 Georgia 24-21 on the road Sept. 27, then added wins over ranked Vanderbilt, Missouri and Tennessee. The Tide later lost 23-21 on the road to Oklahoma but rebounded with a win over Auburn to clinch a spot in the SEC championship game.\n\nAgainst Georgia in Atlanta, Alabama turned in an abysmal performance. In the 28-7 loss, the Tide were held to minus-3 rushing yards and just 209 yards of total offense, finishing 3-for-14 on third down. The showing was so poor that many expected Alabama to be left out of the CFP.\n\nInstead, the committee awarded Alabama a bid, and the Tide went on the road to face Oklahoma. Despite falling behind 17-0 early, they stormed back to win 34-24, briefly restoring DeBoer in Alabama fans' good graces. However, the 38-3 Rose Bowl loss quickly erased that goodwill. If Alabama gets off to a slow start in 2026, DeBoer will likely be under intense scrutiny again.\n\nTide fans’ fickle opinions are a big reason DeBoer was linked to the open Penn State and Michigan jobs. Expect his name to surface again in the 2026 coaching carousel if things remain unsteady in Tuscaloosa. With Thursday's loss, DeBoer's Alabama teams have dropped to 0-7 when trailing at halftime.\n\nHere's a look at Alabama's schedule for 2026:\n\nMORE:Worst Alabama losses: Where Rose Bowl defeat vs. Indiana ranks",

    "description": "While speaking with NJ Advance Media's Cayden Steele, Mailata hinted at an early retirement, but only after he finds his replacement.",
    "fullText": "Jordan Mailata's story with the Eagles isn't quite rags to riches. Still, the All-Pro left tackle has improved drastically year by year since Philadelphia selected the former Australian Rugby Player in the late rounds of the 2018 NFL draft. Since then, Mailata, 28, has developed into one of the NFL's most efficient and highest graded left tackles.\n\nMailata, like Jason Kelce before him, has taken on a mentor role in the Eagles' locker room, and like the former All-Pro center, Mailata will play a role in finding his eventual successor. While speaking with NJ Advance Media's Cayden Steele, Mailata hinted at an early retirement, but only after he finds his replacement.\n\n“I care a lot, man,” Mailata said. “I care a lot because I only have so long to play this game, man. Everyone’s like, ‘Oh, you can play another five years.’ Yeah, bulls---. I’m already in the phase of bringing the next guy along with me. Who’s it gonna be? I can’t tell you, but it’s a high standard playing in this city, so just gotta keep that going. And for me it’s just, I want the best for those boys. I am always going to root for the underdog.”\n\n“In a sense, I’d feel a type of way,” Mailata said about not finding his replacement before retirement. “You just want to leave it in a good place. Leave it as you found it.”\n\nWith the help of Lane Johnson and offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, Mailata has become the face of the NFL's International Pathway Program. Mailata's 83.8 overall grade from PFF is the 8th best in the NFL, while his 81.2 pass blocking grade is eighth as well.\n\nMailata has allowed two sacks in 972 pass block snaps.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Jordan Mailata has started to scout his likely successor with Eagles",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox are reportedly looking to add another bat and could pursue one of the top hitters.\n\nBoston has continued to show interest in bringing back Alex Bregman, but the team has also shown interest in Bo Bichette. Now, MLB.com’s analyst Jared Greenspan and Theo DeRosa linked the Red Sox to Eugenio Suarez if the team can’t land either Bregman or Bichette.\n\n“Boston could still use another impact bat,” the two wrote in an article published on Thursday. “Among the top remaining free-agent hitters, shortstop Bo Bichette and outfielders Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger aren’t the most natural fits for the Red Sox.\n\n“But re-signing third baseman Alex Bregman would be an obvious move. If Bregman signs elsewhere, slugger Eugenio Suarez could be a fallback option.”\n\nSuarez would be an impact bat for Boston and could play third base and hit in the middle of the order. The slugger split last season between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Seattle Mariners, and he hit 49 home runs with 118 RBIs. The 49 home runs tied his career-high back in 2019.\n\nThe Red Sox have also been linked to Ketel Marte in trade talks, but it’s uncertain if the Diamondbacks will move him.\n\nRegardless of who it ends up being, adding a bat is likely the priority for the Red Sox after shoring up their pitching staff this offseason.\n\nSo far this offseason, Boston has acquired first baseman Willson Contreras and pitchers Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo in three separate trades.\n\nRed Sox Fans Shouldn’t Forget About These Two Vital Extensions",

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes, Indiana’s defense thoroughly throttled Alabama, and the top-seeded Hoosiers roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 38-3 victory in the 112th Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nMendoza passed for 192 yards in his first game since winning his school’s first Heisman Trophy, but the hard-nosed Hoosiers (14-0, No. 1 CFP seed) won the Rose Bowl for the first time in school history by dominating the Crimson Tide (11-4, No. 9 CFP seed) at the line of scrimmage.\n\nIndiana scored the game’s first 24 points before pouring it on with fourth-quarter rushing TDs from Kaelon Black and Roman Hemby, wrapping up a jubilant win in the 112th edition of the Granddaddy of Them All.\n\nCharlie Becker, Omar Cooper Jr. and Elijah Sarratt caught TD passes, while Black rushed for 99 yards. Indiana outgained Alabama 407-193, steadily delighting a decidedly pro-Indiana crowd that celebrated its long-struggling team’s first Rose Bowl game appearance since 1968 with chants of “Hoosier Daddy?” in the final minutes.\n\nIndiana had not won any bowl game since the Copper Bowl in 1991, but history has been no match for Curt Cignetti and his dominant Hoosiers during the coach’s two transcendent seasons.\n\nThe Hoosiers are headed to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9 for a CFP semifinal rematch with fifth-seeded Oregon, which routed Texas Tech 23-0 earlier Thursday in the Orange Bowl. Indiana beat the then-No. 3 Ducks 30-20 in Eugene last October in one of Cignetti’s most impressive Big Ten victories.\n\nIndiana is two wins away from the first national championship in school history after becoming the first team to advance following a first-round bye in the current 12-team playoff format. The first six bye teams — including the first two this season — couldn’t come back strong from an extra-long layoff, but the Hoosiers took care of business while improving to 25-2 under Cignetti.\n\nThe Crimson Tide’s second season under Kalen DeBoer ended in the same venue as their final season under Nick Saban two years ago. Alabama was outclassed one week after an impressive road win over Oklahoma, managing just 151 yards before the meaningless final minutes of this blowout.\n\nTy Simpson passed for 67 yards before backup Austin Mack replaced him in the third quarter. Mack immediately got the Tide rolling on a 65-yard drive leading to a short field goal, but the Hoosiers responded with two unstoppable TD drives.\n\nIndiana dominated the famous Rose Bowl turf, which stayed pristine despite nearly 24 hours of steady rain before kickoff. The storms dissipated while the Hoosiers took their first-half lead, and blue skies appeared in the second half.\n\nAfter the first scoreless first quarter in a Rose Bowl in 26 years, Indiana’s second drive stretched 84 yards and 16 plays over nearly nine minutes before Nicolas Radicic’s 31-yard field goal on the first snap of the second quarter.\n\nIndiana’s defense then stopped Alabama on fourth and 1 at the Tide 34, and Mendoza fired a long, high pass to the leaping Becker four plays later for a 21-yard touchdown.\n\nSimpson fumbled in Indiana territory after a courageous first-down scramble late in the first half, and the Hoosiers methodically drove for Mendoza’s 1-yard TD pass with 17 seconds left to Cooper, the hero of Indiana’s dramatic victory over Penn State.\n\nAfter halftime, Mendoza led a steady 79-yard drive ending in his 24-yard TD pass to the leaping Sarratt.\n\nThe victory is the latest step in the monumental two-season turnaround of what was the losingest program in college football when Cignetti took charge. After winning 11 games and reaching the CFP last season, the Hoosiers steamrolled through their schedule this fall before beating defending national champion Ohio State for the Big Ten title and ascending to the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 for the first time.\n\nAlabama: It was remarkable to see the most successful program of the 21st century get dominated up front. The Tide’s inability to run the ball was a season-long problem, but it was particularly painful in Pasadena. Whether through personnel or scheme, DeBoer’s offense must take a step forward next year to reach the standard expected at Bama.\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers acted like they’ve been here before, even though they haven’t. Cignetti’s group has a businesslike demeanor that wasn’t remotely altered by Alabama’s reputation and history.\n\nAlabama: Host East Carolina on Sept. 5.\n\nIndiana: A trip to Atlanta to face the powerhouse Ducks, who lost last season’s Rose Bowl to Ohio State as the No. 1 seed.",

    "description": "Diggs is optimistic about the opportunity and adjusting to life in Green Bay — he's got a friend in Micah Parsons helping him make the transition.",
    "fullText": "As the saying goes, \"new year, new me.\" It's a timely one for new Green Bay Packers cornerback Trevon Diggs, who was claimed off waivers Wednesday after being released by the Dallas Cowboys Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm not chasing accolades. I'm not chasing anything,\" Diggs told reporters Thursday, New Year's Day, before adding, \"I'm chasing being a better me, being better every day, helping this team win.\"\n\nThe Cowboys moved on from Diggs just two years after signing the two-time Pro Bowl corner to a five-year, $97 million extension.\n\nTrevon Diggs on the level of player he thinks he is:\n\n“Still feel like I’m the best.”\n\nHis locker is three down from Micah Parsons, who he called right after learning the Packers claimed him.\n\n“He told me it’s work, it’s a lot different and he said I’m gonna like it a lot.” pic.twitter.com/9zun21Ougo\n\n— Matt Schneidman (@mattschneidman) January 1, 2026\n\nCowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer said Diggs' release resulted from a \"culmination of multiple factors,\" one of which was the Maryland native straying from protocol and not flying back to Dallas with the team after its Christmas Day road win over the Washington Commanders. Diggs had asked Schottenheimer if he could stay in the D.C. area to see family, but Schottenheimer turned down Diggs, just as he said he rejected requests from other players who had asked to fly separately that week.\n\n\"It was one of many factors,\" Schottenheimer said Wednesday, per ESPN. \"It was not the only factor. I'm not the Grinch that stole Christmas. I love Christmas. I love my family. But at the end of the day, we have a protocol that we go through, and the process was not followed.\"\n\nAnother factor Schottenheimer mentioned was Diggs' performance. After piling up 17 interceptions across his first three seasons in the NFL, including a league-leading 11 as a first-team All-Pro in 2021, the 2020 second-round pick from Alabama has tallied just three picks over the past three seasons.\n\nThis time around, the 27-year-old Diggs has played in eight games and, according to Pro Football Focus, is currently allowing a perfect 158.3 passer rating when targeted. Vocal about his frustration with the Cowboys' defensive scheme this season, he's given up 16 catches on 20 targets for 286 yards and three touchdowns without a single pass break-up or interception, per PFF.\n\nDespite those meager metrics, Diggs still has the confidence of a CB1.\n\n\"I still feel like I'm the best,\" he said Thursday.\n\nInjuries disrupted the brilliant start to his Cowboys career. During practice early in the 2023 campaign, Diggs tore the ACL in his left knee. That injury cost him most of that season.\n\nHe made his way back for the 2024 season, although he later missed time with a groin injury and then was shut down for the year to have another surgery on his left knee.\n\nDiggs was sidelined while rehabbing this past offseason, including during training camp leading up to a Week 1 return that Packers edge rusher Micah Parsons, one of Diggs' close friends, criticized the Cowboys for mismanaging.\n\nDiggs suffered a concussion in October because of an accident at home. A TV that he was trying to mount fell on his head, as reported by NFL Network's Jane Slater last month. Also that month, he was placed on injured reserve due to a right knee injury that had lingered this fall.\n\nHe didn't return until Week 16. By that point, the Cowboys were already eliminated from postseason contention. Diggs said Thursday that he's healthy, joked that he'll be using Taskrabbit for his handyman work from now on and emphasized that he's grateful to be in position to help a contender like the playoff-bound Packers.\n\n\"It's been a great feeling,\" Diggs said. \"They believe in me. I believe in myself, and I'm ready. It's going to be fun.\"\n\nDiggs said he got the call that he was headed to the Packers Wednesday just as he was about to take his kids to Dave & Buster's.\n\nThe trip was tabled, but the moment was celebrated.\n\nThen Diggs contacted Parsons, whom the Cowboys traded to the Packers in late August after an infamous contract standoff.\n\n\"Yeah, I called him right away,\" Diggs said of Parsons. \"He's super excited for me, super happy for me. We have a great relationship — our families, our moms, everyone is real close, so it all worked out.\"\n\nParsons, now a five-time Pro Bowler, logged 12.5 sacks in his first 14 games with Green Bay, however, a torn ACL in Week 15 cut his inaugural Packers campaign short.\n\nWhile the sack artist won't be on the field with Diggs this season, they now share a locker room again. Parsons has offered Diggs a place to crash and a car to drive. He's also provided the corner with some insight about playing for the Packers.\n\n\"He told me it's work. It's a lot different,\" Diggs said. \"He said I'm going to like it a lot, and I'm going to enjoy it. So far I've been enjoying it a lot.\n\n\"My first day was out there today, and I had a lot of fun, and it's a great thing to be here.\"\n\nDiggs admitted that blocking out all the noise surrounding him recently has been a challenge. He's focused on moving forward in the New Year.\n\n\"I want to be here as long as they want me to be here, for sure,\" he said. \"I like it here a lot. I got relationships here already, and I would love to call this place home.\"",

    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins have brought in Hall-of-Fame QB and ESPN analyst Troy Aikman as a consultant to assist with their search for a general manager, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. The three-time Super Bowl champion’s role will not be permanent; he will serve as an advisor throughout the process of finding the Dolphins’ next GM.\n\nDespite Aikman’s lack of front-office experience, it is common for teams to bring in new perspectives when seeking new leadership. Former Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers served as a key advisor during the Washington Commanders' coaching search.\n\nFormer New England Patriots quarterback and Fox analyst Tom Brady has also served as an advisor to Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis in his role as a minority owner.\n\nBrady has assisted the Raiders with insights on football operations, player acquisitions, and their coaching search. Brady has been criticized for having a conflict of interest with his role as a broadcaster and a team owner.\n\nThe biggest difference between Aikman’s role and Brady’s is that Aikman does not have ownership of the team, and his position is temporary. Aikman’s role with the Dolphins will end once they have found their next GM.\n\nIn October, the Dolphins and former general manager Chris Grier decided to mutually part ways after the team’s 2-7 start. Grier had been the general manager since 2016, leading the team to five winning seasons and three playoff appearances during his tenure.\n\nThe new GM will need to work with Dolphins owner Stephen Ross to determine the future direction of the team. The first order of business will be deciding whether head coach Mike McDaniel and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa will remain with the team next year.\n\nMcDaniel is 35–34 as the Dolphins’ head coach and has missed the playoffs in the last two seasons. Tagovailoa is coming off his worst season as a starting quarterback. McDaniel’s contract runs through the 2028 season.\n\nTagovailoa’s 15 interceptions are the second-worst in the NFL, and he was benched for seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers. Tagovailoa signed a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension, which is set to run through the 2028 season.",

    "title": "The year of unaffordability",
    "description": "2025 was marked by rising prices. Fortunately, classical liberalism offers the resources we need to overcome the crisis.",
    "fullText": "As 2025 draws to a close, American politics ends where it began: the affordability crisis is at the top of the agenda. Housing, healthcare, childcare, education, and even electricity in some places all seem to be slipping further out of ordinary reach, even as the economy continues to grow.\n\nClassical liberalism offers a straightforward diagnosis and an equally straightforward cure. Remove unnecessary regulations that constrict supply and withdraw subsidies that artificially inflate demand! Yet the year has also provided familiar public choice stories about the obstacles to these sensible solutions. Concentrated interests profit from regulation and subsidies, but their costs are thinly dispersed across millions of consumers. The Trump administration’s renewed push for deregulation offers a glimmer of hope, but 2025 illustrates both the generative power of liberty and the political obstacles from past incursions on our freedoms.\n\nAt bottom, the affordability issue reflects the failure of wages to keep pace with prices. Given that incomes in the United States have generally been increasing, affordability is not a fundamentally macroeconomic problem of stimulating greater economic growth, although, of course, growth would be beneficial. It is, instead, a microeconomic problem in which prices in essential sectors such as housing, medicine, education, and parts of agriculture continue to rise much faster than inflation. What do these sectors have in common? Government intervention in the form of price controls, subsidies, or both. In areas where the government is absent, prices for technological goods or home-delivered household goods through online platforms such as Amazon are decreasing, quality is increasing, or both.\n\nThus, the classical liberal solution to this year’s economic crisis is more of the old-time religion: free markets, open competition, and the elimination of subsidies, particularly to those who are not poor. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. Restrictions on market entry benefit incumbents, who have greater influence with politicians than unorganized entrants. Subsidies drive up prices. But, of course, those enjoying the subsidies have every interest in retaining them. The effect of subsidies on prices is just an economic argument, but for the recipient, the subsidy appears as money in the bank. It is thus unsurprising that they are challenging to eliminate. Political scientists have long observed that legislation tends to deliver concentrated benefits and diffuse costs, even if the diffuse costs far exceed the benefits.\n\nIt is a striking confirmation of the grip of this political truth that the Democratic Party chose to make the administration’s failure to extend new healthcare subsidies the issue on which it shut down the federal government. Moreover, the government’s perennial inability to end any “free” government money was underscored by the fact that these subsidies had originally been sold as a short-term solution to the pandemic and that some of them go to families earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. According to prevailing political consensus, the Democrats won the shutdown with their tactical maneuver, and their opponents, while in the legislative majority, have struggled to develop a politically feasible response.\n\nYet these subsidies increase the cost of healthcare and insurance by making consumers less price-conscious. One solution is to subsidize health insurance only for catastrophic medical events among the poor, rather than day-to-day care for the middle class. Yet, of course, the insurance companies, whose profits are padded by subsidized sign-ups from whatever sources, strongly oppose any such reform.\n\nAnd health insurance is not the only government distortion of the market for medical care. There are numerous supply-side restrictions. Licensing regimes restrict the use of nonphysician providers, and certification-of-need requirements delay the entry of new hospitals, yet doctors and incumbent hospitals benefit from government regulations. The FDA is a barrier for many new drug candidates. Medical care is thus not only a poster child for the affordability crisis but also for government dysfunction.\n\nThe other area most discussed in affordability is housing. Again, developments in 2025 indicate that it will be challenging to reduce housing costs through deregulation. Just as the government shutdown was the most striking federal political event, the most striking local one was the election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City. Not surprisingly for a self-proclaimed socialist, his policies are the opposite of the classical liberal program. He ran on a platform to address affordability through price controls and subsidies, specifically draconian rent controls, as well as “free” childcare and buses.\n\nGiven that bad government regulation is at the heart of the affordability crisis, the most effective antidote is deregulation.\n\nHis platform is more proof of the power of public choice analysis. Economists across the political spectrum oppose rent control because it reduces the housing stock over the long run and disincentivizes housing supply. It is thus a policy that undermines affordability rather than promotes it. Nevertheless, rent control remains politically popular. There are more tenants than landlords, and those who are prevented from moving into the city do not have the right to vote in municipal elections.\n\nThe classical liberal solution would be the opposite. Eliminate rent controls and increase housing supply by weakening zoning regulations. Unfortunately, the latter is almost as unpopular as the former because homeowners benefit from restricted entry that keeps housing prices high, particularly in New York City, where soaring prices make homeowners’ homes a disproportionate share of their net worth.\n\nThe childcare subsidies will raise effective costs, as providers increase their prices to the same extent as colleges have, given government grants and low-cost loans. A better solution would be to deregulate childcare, allowing providers to operate from their own homes, as they did in earlier centuries.\n\nMedicine, housing, and childcare are only a few of the sectors in which the government restricts price competition. For instance, obstructive licensing regimes have impeded infrastructure development. Moreover, some of these impediments have increased energy costs by delaying pipeline construction and the expansion of the electric grid.\n\nGiven that bad government regulation is at the heart of the affordability crisis, the most effective antidote is deregulation. Thus, the most significant source of optimism for classical liberals in 2025 was the Trump administration’s domestic deregulatory agenda. Most importantly, the Trump administration has made substantial changes to the overall regulatory structure. It has emphasized regulatory budgeting and required the deregulation of ten rules for every new rule issued. It has mandated that new regulations be issued, or existing ones survive, only if they are based on the best reading of the statute, thereby suggesting that the administration will reconsider regulations grounded in overly aggressive readings that supported expansive regulation.\n\nIt has also pursued sector-by-sector deregulation. Particularly notable are those that seek to remove regulatory barriers to energy production and to roll back requirements that mandate the production of electric vehicles by automakers. In education, it is moving to allow greater choice among accreditors, making it easier for schools to secure approval for innovative and cost-reducing ideas. It has also focused on deregulating financial services and securities regulation, including crypto, to stimulate capital markets. The more efficient capital markets are, the easier it is for upstarts to challenge incumbents, increasing competition and reducing prices.\n\nNevertheless, many of the regulatory bottlenecks underlying the affordability crisis are at the state and local levels. For instance, the federal government has limited power to influence zoning and state permitting regulations that make new housing expensive to build. Nor can the federal government eliminate the pernicious and growing local rent control.\n\nFortunately, the administration’s focus on deregulating artificial intelligence, an initiative I have discussed before as a mechanism for boosting economic growth, is also likely to address affordability problems caused by the regulation at all levels of government. One of AI’s promises of affordability is that it can reduce regulatory compliance costs, which function as entry barriers, shielding incumbents and pushing smaller firms out of markets altogether. Moreover, AI can reduce costs for diffuse groups, such as consumers seeking to organize against special interests, and publicize the costs of regulation, thereby exerting political pressure for regulatory simplification or elimination.\n\nTake my own field of law. Software is far less effective than AI-enabled online companies at providing low-cost legal assistance for routine legal documents, such as wills and powers of attorney. When the lawyers’ guild argued that such aid was illegal as the unauthorized practice of law, our words of decentralized media helped build pressure in states like Texas to exempt these new practices from such legal prohibitions. Thus, technology can both cut the cost of providing expert advice and reduce the barriers that protect incumbents from competition.\n\nThus, the rise of artificial intelligence will help address the affordability crisis, at least initially, by reducing fixed compliance costs, weakening entry barriers, and assisting diffuse interests in organizing against regulatory excess. But that same promise will invite efforts to convert the legitimate needs for “AI safety” into the next regulatory moat.\n\nWhether AI can continue to improve affordability depends on which impulse prevails. Will it be the use of innovative technologies to expand competition and supply, or their capture by incumbents seeking new protection? History suggests no final victory. The struggle for affordability is never finished because it is essentially a struggle for liberty. It must be renewed generation by generation.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has publicly humiliated his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt by contradicting her repeated reassurances and excuses about his health woes.\n\nSince Trump, 79, returned to office last January, speculation has raged over bruising on his hands and about his cognitive ability, particularly after he underwent a mystery scan in the fall—with the Daily Beast leading the way on reporting the president’s various medical issues, including his swollen cankles.\n\nLeavitt, 28, has repeatedly claimed the reason for the discoloration on the back of his right hand—which the president has covered up with band-aids, bandages, and thick make-up—is that as “a man of the people,” Trump “meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nWhile Leavitt has also attributed the bruising to the president’s routine aspirin use, she has often led her responses to questions about Trump’s hands by blaming his handshaking, including when questioned on the matter earlier this month by the Beast’s political correspondent Farrah Tomazin.\n\n“The president is literally constantly shaking hands, the Oval Office is like Grand Central Terminal,” she explained earlier this month.\n\nDays after the bruising appeared to spread to Trump’s left hand—which he does not use to greet people—the president on Thursday gave a revelatory interview about his health to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump offered a different reason for the bruising: overuse of aspirin and his thinning skin.\n\nHe told the Journal that he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin a day—four times the 81-milligram “low dose” commonly used in daily therapy, per the Mayo Clinic—despite conceding his doctors have urged him to take less.\n\nThis higher-than-recommended aspirin use, Trump said, has become a central factor in the bruising that’s been spotted on his hands. But he told the outlet he refuses to reduce the dose because he’s been on the same routine for decades, and is “a little superstitious.”\n\nTrump also said he wears makeup because he has soft skin, and it bruises when it gets “whacked.”\n\nDiscussing an episode in which Attorney General Pam Bondi, 60, nicked him during a high-five, he told the Journal: “The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut.”\n\nHe added that he puts makeup on his hands after he gets “whacked again by someone,” saying: “I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds.”\n\nTrump also gave more details about his October scan, further embarrassing Leavitt, who has fended off repeated inquiries about it from the White House podium.\n\nShe at first repeatedly answered questions without naming the test and leaning on scripted assurances about his condition. On October 23, she declined to specify what test he received. On November 4, pressed on why Trump had a week earlier described it as an MRI, she said she would “check back,” while insisting he was in “optimal physical health” and framing the Walter Reed visit as a routine follow-up.\n\nWhen asked again on November 12, Leavitt leaned on the language of the doctor’s memo, reiterating that Trump received “advanced imaging” as part of a routine exam and that physicians considered him in “exceptional” condition, without explaining why the imaging was ordered.\n\nLeavitt’s position remained the same until December 1, when Trump’s physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, released a memo describing cardiovascular imaging. Leavitt told reporters the screening was normal and positioned the disclosure as transparency.\n\nEven then, the White House’s preferred shorthand remained “advanced imaging,” rather than a clear, consistent label for what Trump had undergone.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Trump said he’d been telling people it was an MRI, but then corrected it: “It wasn’t an MRI… It was less than that. It was a scan.” He complained that getting the test had handed critics “ammunition” because it fueled questions about whether something was wrong.\n\nThe Journal reported that Trump and Barbabella ultimately characterized the procedure as a CT scan performed to rule out cardiovascular issues, with no abnormalities found.\n\nLeavitt is quoted in the Journal saying the White House had “often referred to the procedure as ‘advanced imaging,’” while not addressing why Trump didn’t correct the MRI/CT description sooner.\n\nIn the Journal article, Trump also discussed his ‘cankles’ and why he apparently cannot stay awake during public meetings.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and Leavitt for comment.",

    "description": "\"Customers are asked to return this product to their nearest store.\"",
    "fullText": "Nothing dampens the holiday spirit more than an unexpected bout of allergies. Unfortunately, a Christmas-themed product from Aldi might've left some customers with more than a bad taste in their mouths.\n\nThe Independent reported that the U.K. supermarket chain recalled Perfect Christmas Mozzarella Sticks in Blankets from its stores. This product contains egg, which wasn't listed on the packaging.\n\n\"Customers are asked to return this product to their nearest store, where a full refund will be given,\" Aldi wrote in the recall notice. \"We apologise that this product did not meet our normal high standards and thank you for your co-operation.\"\n\nThe affected product was sold in 278-gram (about 9.8-ounce) packages with a use-by date of December 15. The U.K. Food Standards Agency (FSA) urged consumers with allergies or intolerance to eggs to return the product instead of rolling the dice.\n\nCustomers can make good on Aldi's refund, in any case. Aldi also informed customers that they could receive more information via a phone number or on help.aldi.co.uk.\n\nLabel accuracy is crucial for managing food intolerance and allergies. When companies fail to list allergens, consumers must depend on others for accurate information.\n\nSomeone with an egg allergy could have a serious reaction when they were simply trying to enjoy some seasonal mozz sticks. You can imagine the potential consequences, including a possible trip to the hospital.\n\nEggs are one of the 14 allergens the FSA requires to be declared, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers them one of the \"Big 9\" allergies that are leading causes of reactions and symptoms.\n\nFood recalls often highlight broader concerns in the food production industry, including a lack of oversight or inconsistent safety standards.  These failures can result in cross-contamination between different products or the inclusion of unlisted allergens and hazardous materials into food.\n\nThat can have significant implications for households. Many other things besides eggs have made it into food mistakenly, including another common allergen: milk. Other scenarios include pieces of plastic making it into a pulled pork sandwich or salad dressing.\n\nShould companies be required to help recycle their own products?\n\nThey should get tax breaks instead\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nUltimately, ensuring better food safety is a group effort by manufacturers, regulators, and consumers. On the front end, manufacturers need to tighten up their production to minimize mistakes that can lead to missing instances of unlisted ingredients and contamination.\n\nRegulators can proactively check up on producers to make sure they are closely complying with food safety standards. Because humans are involved, there's always a chance something can slip through the cracks.\n\nThat's where it becomes incumbent on consumers to raise the alarm if something is off on a food item. Regulators can broadcast that message quickly and minimize the damage with comprehensive and expedient recall notices.\n\nThe next step falls to producers to find out where things went sideways and address any lingering issues that led to the mistake.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Now that the Kansas City Chiefs have committed to building a new stadium and team headquarters in Kansas, what’s next for the Truman Sports Complex?\n\nWhile the Royals could still renew their lease with Jackson County, county legislator Manny Abarca says it’s time to start thinking about the future of the land.\n\n“At the end of 2031, December 1, something will change and we want to be ready for that with a plan, with a strategy, if we’ve got to tear down one or two stadiums, we should be prepared for that, not waiting for after the fact,” Abarca said.\n\nAbarca wrote a letter to Jackson County Executive Phil LeVota on Wednesday, with a plan to use the existing Repair, Maintenance, Management, and Operations (RMMO) fund to set aside money for the potential demolition of one or both stadiums and the redevelopment of the land.\n\n“We’ve got to have a strategic plan going forward,” Abarca said.\n\n“That opportunity of us, scrapping some of that maintenance and repair money towards the strategic plan is still within our RMMO accounts. So, there’s some opportunity. We just have to be willing to do it.”\n\nCurrently, a 3/8 cent sales tax sends roughly $55 million annually to the complex’s upkeep and renovations. Saving half of that money over the course of the next 5 years could amount to north of $137 million.\n\nAs for what’s next for the land, Abarca says it could be of huge benefit for the county.\n\n“I think we can look at that as a county park, as a county asset. There were houses there before and so I think there’s an opportunity to look at that as a public housing option if there aren’t stadiums there. It’s adjacent to our Rock Island corridor, which is currently a bike route, but could be a mass transit route. There’s a lot of opportunity, right? Its geographic location is really center of our county.”\n\nWhether the Royals decide to stay at Truman or leave, Abarca says it’s time to be prepared for the next phase of that land.\n\n“Before taxpayers were asked to fund stadiums, this was a green space. These were neighborhoods. These were communities. There’s vibrancy that was there before. Now, instead of walking away with an abandoned stadium, that can be 30 to 50 to $70 million to tear down and maybe two of those, it can at least be a green space.”",

    "description": "Does today's Wordle have you stumped? Here are some hints and the answer.",
    "fullText": "Happy new year! We hope 2026 brings you everything you long for. One thing you might be looking for is to keep your Wordle streak going for as long as possible. To help with that, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Thursday's puzzle (#1,657).\n\nIt may be that you're a Wordle newcomer and you're not completely sure how to play the game. We're here to help with that as well.\n\nWordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that debuted in 2021. There is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.\n\nWordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that shows how they fare each day in a spoiler-free way. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.\n\nThe New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.\n\nTo start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard. However, you can still use those letters in subsequent guesses.\n\nYou'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.\n\nWordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets and Discord. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.\n\nIf you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,600 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.\n\nIn addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.\n\nBefore today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed:\n\nYesterday's Wordle answer for Wednesday, December 31 — SIREN\n\nEvery day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word.\n\nIn case you still haven't quite figured it out by that point, we'll then provide the first letter of the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle.\n\nThis should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly. Spoilers are ahead.\n\nHere is a hint for today's Wordle answer:\n\nA short story akin to a fairy tale that has a moral lesson to impart.\n\nThere are no repeated letters in today's Wordle answer.\n\nThe first letter of today's Wordle answer is F.\n\nThis is your final warning before we reveal today's Wordle answer. No take-backs.\n\nDon't blame us if you happen to scroll too far and accidentally spoil the game for yourself.\n\nWhat is today’s Wordle? Today's Wordle answer is...\n\nNot to worry if you didn't figure out today's Wordle word. If you made it this far down the page, hopefully you at least kept your streak going. And, hey: there's always another game tomorrow.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Widening demonstrations sparked by Iran's ailing economy spread Thursday into the Islamic Republic's rural provinces, with at least seven people being killed in the first fatalities reported among security forces and protesters, authorities said.\n\nThe deaths may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran’s theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded elsewhere. The fatalities, two on Wednesday and five on Thursday, occurred in four cities, largely home to Iran’s Lur ethnic group.\n\nThe protests have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the demonstrations have yet to be countrywide and have not been as intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.\n\nThe most-intense violence appeared to strike Azna, a city in Iran's Lorestan province, some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of Tehran. There, online videos purported to show objects in the street ablaze and gunfire echoing as people shouted: “Shameless! Shameless!”\n\nThe semiofficial Fars news agency reported three people had been killed. Other media, including pro-reform outlets, cited Fars for the report while state-run media did not fully acknowledge the violence there or elsewhere. It wasn't clear why there wasn't more reporting over the unrest, but journalists had faced arrest over their reporting in 2022.\n\nIn Lordegan, a city in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, online videos showed demonstrators gathered on a street, with the sound of gunfire in the background. The footage matched known features of Lordegan, some 470 kilometers (290 miles) south of Tehran.\n\nFars, citing an anonymous official, said two people had been killed during the protests Thursday.\n\nThe Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said two people had been killed there, identifying the dead as demonstrators. It also shared a still image of what appeared to be an Iranian police officer, wearing body armor and wielding a shotgun.\n\nIn 2019, the area around Lordegan saw widespread protests and demonstrators reportedly damaged government buildings after a report said people there had been infected with HIV by contaminated needles used at a local health care clinic.\n\nIn Fuladshahr in Iran's Isfahan province, state media reported on the death of a man there Thursday that activist groups attributed to the police opening fire on demonstrators.\n\n'Protests due to economic pressures'\n\nA separate demonstration Wednesday night reportedly led to the 21-year-old volunteer in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Basij force.\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member’s death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, which is believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Lorestan province.\n\nThe Guard member “was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defense of public order,” he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.\n\n“The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns,\" Pourali said. \"The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.”\n\nThe protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, over 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Tehran. Local prosecutor Kazem Nazari said 20 people had been arrested after the protests and that calm had returned to the city, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.\n\nIran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters. However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.\n\nMeanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had linked to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.\n\nIran's theocracy had declared Wednesday a public holiday across much of the country, citing cold weather, likely as a bid to get people out of the capital for a long weekend. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.\n\nThe protests, taking root in economic issues, have heard demonstrators chant against Iran's theocracy as well. The country's leaders are still reeling after Israel launched a 12-day war against the country in June. The U.S. also bombed Iranian nuclear sites during the war.\n\nIran has said it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program to ease sanctions. However, those talks have yet to happen as U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have warned Tehran against reconstituting its atomic program.",

    "description": "In 1930, archaeologists found he lower half of a massive statue of Ramesses II. Now, they've discovered the long-missing top half in pristine condition.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nIn 1930, German archaeologists uncovered the lower half of a massive statue, estimating that it likely originally stood some 23 feet tall.\n\nNow, U.S. and Egyptian archaeologists have announced the discovery of the long-missing top half in thankfully pristine condition.\n\nA proposal has already been submitted to unite the bottom with the long-missing top half, and the discoverers are confident of its approval.\n\nSome 96 years ago, German archaeologist Günther Roeder unearthed the lower half of what would’ve been a massive, 23-foot-tall statue of Ramesses II—one of the most celebrated pharaohs throughout all 31 dynasties of Ancient Egyptian history. Roeder found the statue 150 miles south of Cairo in the Minya Governorate, near the modern-day city of El Ashmunein. In ancient times, this area along the Nile was known as Khemnu. It served as a provincial capital in the Old Kingdom of Egypt (2649–2130 BCE), and was later called Hermopolis Magna when Romans ruled the Mediterranean.\n\nMany treasures of the region’s illustrious past were known to be buried in the surrounding desert, and while Roeder’s discovery proved remarkable, the rest of the enormous statue he found remained lost to time … until now.\n\nIn March 2024, the Egyptian archaeologists—in partnership with U.S. experts—announced that after 96 years, they’d finally found the missing upper half of Roeder’s statute. Speaking with Reuters, the experts from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities reported that the upper half stretched some 12.5 feet tall, and depicted Ramesses II wearing a headdress topped with a royal cobra.\n\nHowever, the discovery of this ancient statue—and exquisite preservation—was far from certain when the statue was first discovered lying face down in January 2024.\n\n“One problem with Hermopolis is that it’s close to the Nile. After [the building of] the Aswan Low Dam, the water table became a huge issue. There was no guarantee that the stone would be OK,” Yvona Trnka-Amrhein, assistant professor of classics at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-leader of the team said in a press statement. “Sometimes sandstone is uncovered that is basically just sand or degraded limestone. It could have just been a lump of rock.”\n\nLuckily, after further excavation, the team confirmed that the statue was remarkably well-preserved and contained another amazing find—traces of blue-and-yellow pigment could be found on the statue’s surface. Hopefully, further analysis of this pigment will help researchers understand the context of the statue’s creation, as well as its original appearance.\n\n“We knew it might be there, but we were not specifically looking for it,” Trnka-Amrhein said in a press statement. “It was plausible that the rest of the statue might be there, but it was a total surprise.”\n\nThankfully, the hunch proved correct, and Egyptian co-leader Basem Gehad has already submitted a proposal to reunite the two pieces together at long last (Roeder’s lower half still remains on site in El Ashmunein). Trnka-Amrhein expects it to be approved.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump may now be having trouble walking across flat surfaces.\n\nThe president appeared to be hiding a slight limp as he was filmed walking with his wife, Melania, at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe new speculation over the 79-year-old’s health came after he revealed in an interview that he tried compression socks for his swollen ankles and used makeup to cover the bruising on his hands caused by large daily doses of aspirin.\n\nThe popular anti-Trump X account Call to Activism posted a clip of Trump appearing to drag his right leg as he walked down a runway toward the press gathered to snap attendees of his ritzy New Year’s Eve party.\n\nThe account, which has over 1.1 million followers, wrote, ″Trump just showed up at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate New Year’s, dragging his right leg, and quickly adjusted his walk when he realizes the cameras are on. What’s Trump hiding?\"\n\nIn the clip, Trump can be seen slightly limping as he enters the frame, but after a few steps, he adopts a steadier gait before he and First Lady Melania Trump stop to pose for photographs.\n\nViewers were split on whether the clip showed a new medical malady for the oldest president in American history or if it was no big deal.\n\n“It pretty obvious [sic] he is dragging his right leg. If Biden had done that every news station would have this video up all day all time about his health,” wrote one suspicious viewer on X.\n\n“Honestly? Probably nothing,” said a less-convinced X user. “He knows the cameras are always watching, so of course he adjusted. Not every awkward step means there’s something being hidden.”\n\nOn Monday, the nearly octogenarian president had difficulty descending four small steps at Mar-a-Lago. On multiple occasions, he has descended the steps on Air Force One at a snail’s pace.\n\nHe has also been filmed struggling to walk in straight lines and dragging his right leg in public for years.\n\nWednesday’s Mar-a-Lago entrance comes amidst intensified speculation about Trump’s health issues, which the Daily Beast has led the charge in covering.\n\nThese include persistent bruising on his hands, difficulty sleeping through the night and staying awake during the day, and chronic venous insufficiency, which has caused his ankles to swell.\n\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump personally called the publication to complain about the persistent coverage of his health and attempted to set the record straight on some health mysteries that have dogged his second term.\n\nTrump told the publication that he takes quadruple the common dose of aspirin for “cardiac prevention,” and that is what causes the bruising on his hands.\n\nThe piece did not address speculation about Trump’s ambling gait. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the president’s Mar-a-Lago entrance.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast reported on Trump taking a circuitous route between Marine One and Air Force One in September, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the publication, “You must be f-----g blind or stupid, because that was a perfect walk.”",

    "fullText": "CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — Swiss investigators are probing what caused a fire in a bar at an Alpine ski resort that left around 40 people dead and another 115 injured during a New Year's celebration.\n\nMost injuries, many of them serious, occurred when the blaze swept through the crowded bar less than two hours after midnight Thursday in southwestern Switzerland.\n\nThe Crans-Montana resort is best known as an international ski and golf venue. Overnight, its crowded Le Constellation bar morphed from a scene of revelry into the site of potentially one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.\n\nCrans-Montana is less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Sierre, Switzerland, where 28 people, including many children, were killed when a bus from Belgium crashed inside a Swiss tunnel in 2012.\n\nHere’s what we know about the deadly fire:\n\nThe blaze broke out around 1:30 a.m. Thursday inside the Le Constellation bar amid the holiday celebration.\n\nTwo women told French broadcaster BFMTV they were inside when they saw a male bartender lifting a female bartender on his shoulders as she held a lit candle in a bottle. The flames spread, collapsing the wooden ceiling, they told the broadcaster.\n\nPeople frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door, causing a crowd surge, one of the women said.\n\nA young man at the scene said people smashed windows to escape the fire, some gravely injured, reported BFMTV. He said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames, likening what happened to a horror movie.\n\nThe injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theater at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, said Mathias Reynard, head of the regional government of the Valais Canton.\n\nOfficials rule out possible attack\n\nWhile officials said Thursday it was too early to determine the fire's cause, investigators have already ruled out that it could have been an attack.\n\nExperts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage, said Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, at a news conference.\n\nWork is underway to identify the victims and inform their families, according to Valais Canton police commander Frédéric Gisler.\n\nThe blaze triggered a flashover or backdraft\n\nThe Swiss officials called the blaze an “embrasement généralisé,” a French firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.\n\nVictims suffered from serious burns and smoke inhalation. Some were flown to specialist hospitals across the country.\n\nAuthorities urged people to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require the already overwhelmed medical resources.\n\nA top venue for the world's best athletes\n\nWith high-altitude ski runs rising around 3,000 meters (nearly 9,850 feet) in the heart of the Valais region’s snowy peaks and pine forests, Crans-Montana is one of the top venues on the World Cup circuit.\n\nThe resort will host the best men’s and women’s downhill racers, including Lindsey Vonn, for their final events before the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.\n\nThe town’s Crans-sur-Sierre golf club, down the street from the bar, stages the European Masters each August on a picturesque course.\n\nDazio reported from Berlin and Leicester reported from Paris. Geir Moulson in Berlin and Graham Dunbar in Geneva contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek has ushered in 2026 with a new technical paper, co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng, that proposes a rethink of the fundamental architecture used to train foundational AI models.\n\nThe method - dubbed Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) - forms part of the Hangzhou firm's push to make its models more cost-effective as it strives to keep pace with better-funded US rivals with deeper access to computing power.\n\nIt also reflected the increasingly open, collaborative culture among Chinese AI companies, which have published a growing share of their research in public.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nFor industry watchers, DeepSeek's papers often provide an important early signal of the engineering choices that will shape the start-up's next major model release.\n\nIn the paper, released on Thursday, a team of 19 DeepSeek researchers said they tested mHC on models with 3 billion, 9 billion and 27 billion parameters, and found it scaled without adding significant computational burden.\n\n\"Empirical results confirm that mHC effectively ... [enables] stable large-scale training with superior scalability compared with conventional HC (hyper-connections),\" wrote the researchers, led by Zhenda Xie, Yixuan Wei and Huanqi Cao.\n\nLiang was listed as the final author.\n\nThe team added that \"crucially, through efficient infrastructure-level optimisations,\" mHC delivers these gains with \"negligible computational overhead\".\n\nThe publication also offered fresh evidence that Liang, who has kept a low profile despite DeepSeek's increasing fame, remains closely involved in core research at one of China's most closely watched AI companies.\n\nHyper-connections were first proposed by ByteDance researchers in September 2024 as a tweak to ResNet (residual networks) - a dominant deep learning architecture introduced in 2015 by Microsoft Research Asia scientists including legendary Chinese computer scientist He Kaiming.\n\nResNet enables the training of very deep neural networks by stabilising the training so that key information, or residual, is retained as the number of layers increases.\n\nThe paper was uploaded to the open-access repository arXiv by DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng himself, who has also posted DeepSeek's more prominent technical papers in recent years. Photo: Shutterstock alt=The paper was uploaded to the open-access repository arXiv by DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng himself, who has also posted DeepSeek's more prominent technical papers in recent years. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nIt has become integral to major large language models such as OpenAI's GPT as well as Google DeepMind's Nobel-winning AlphaFold system.\n\nHowever, ResNet has notable limitations, including difficulty ensuring that the learning signal that flows through the neural network remains strong without \"collapsing\" into a one-size-fits-all state.\n\nAccording to the DeepSeek researchers, ByteDance's HC solution successfully addressed these issues by expanding the residual stream and enhancing the complexity of the neural network, \"without altering the computational overhead of individual units.\"\n\nDeepSeek argued, however, that the earlier approach did not fully account for rising memory costs, leaving its \"practical scalability\" constrained for large-model training.\n\nInstead, they proposed an additional tweak that \"constrains\" the HC network with a specific manifold to ensure compute and cost efficiency.\n\n\"mHC will help address current limitations and potentially illuminate new pathways for the evolution of next-generation foundational architectures,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe paper was uploaded to the open-access repository arXiv by DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng himself, who has also posted DeepSeek's more prominent technical papers in recent years, including work linked to its R1 and V3 models.\n\nOther less important papers have typically been uploaded by other researchers.\n\nFlorian Brand, a PhD student at Germany's Trier University and an expert on China's AI ecosystem, said DeepSeek's papers often acted as an early signal of the technical direction behind its next generation of models.\n\nIndustry expectations are running high that DeepSeek could release its next major model in the run-up to the Spring Festival holiday in mid-February.\n\nPreviously, the company released its groundbreaking R1 model on the eve of last year's national holiday, fuelling speculation it could repeat that playbook this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

    "description": "Bitcoin price enters 2026 in a stalemate. A 1% move at key levels could reveal the winner between buyers and sellers.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin price enters 2026 stuck in the same buyer-seller fight that kept it muted through late 2025. The price is almost flat over the past 30 days, down about 0.6%, which shows how neither side has taken control.\n\nIt is still down about 7% year on year. This balance of pressure has turned into a stalemate. However, a 1% or even a 3.5% move from here could decide the next direction if the right conditions appear.\n\nBitcoin is trading inside a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. This shape shows the market trapped between lower highs and higher lows, hinting at the buyer-seller tussle. Capital flows are not helping the upside.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has trended lower since December 10. For the unversed, the CMF measures how much money flows into or out of an asset. It shows a bearish divergence now because the BTC price has trended higher between December 18 and December 31, while the CMF made lower lows. That signals continued outflows and selling pressure.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nThis negative capital flow is being partially offset by exchange outflows.\n\nExchange net position change shows coins leaving exchanges. That often hints at accumulation. On December 19, exchange outflows were about 16,563 BTC. By January 1, they rose to 38,508 BTC.\n\nThat is an increase of about 132%. This push of coins leaving exchanges helps price stability and keeps the lower trendline of the triangle protected.\n\nSmart Money Index readings confirm the lack of direction. The Smart Money Index compares how larger, informed traders position versus the broader market. The line is hugging its signal line with no clear separation. That hints that larger traders are waiting for a breakout and not betting on either direction yet.\n\nUntil the breakout happens, the triangle stays neutral.\n\nThis matches what CMF and exchange flow data are saying. Outflows signal pressure. Exchange withdrawals signal support. Together, they cancel each other and hold the BTC price still. And even the most informed traders are unsure as to which side would win.\n\nThe cost basis heat map highlights clusters where many buyers last bought. These clusters often act like support or resistance. The nearest resistance zone is around $88,082 to $88,459, where about 200,035 BTC sit.\n\nBitcoin is trading near $87,480. A daily close roughly 1% higher would put the price above that zone. That could act as the first bullish trigger and settle the upper triangle break. On the BTC price chart, the level aligning with this cluster is $88,300, which needs to break first.",

    "description": "I'm keeping track of Trump's economy right here. Every month. Enjoy!",
    "fullText": "(AKA the unemployment rate, cost of eggs, gas prices, inflation, the Dow Jones, whether citizens received a stimulus check, and Trump's overall approval rating.)\n\nIt wasn't exactly convincing, considering Americans are facing massive insurance hikes in 2026 because Trump and his party recently chose to allow Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire in two weeks. Likewise, our pockets are shrinking as the cost of food and living bloat.\n\nNote: Data on inflation is released a few weeks after each month has ended, so our reports will look at the previous month's numbers.\n\nGetting data on the unemployment rate between September and November has been plagued and vague due to the government shutdown this year. September's numbers were late. October's rate was altogether canceled, and November appears to have come in at 4.6% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFor someone who brags about a booming economy, the steady increase in Americans searching for work sure doesn't bode well for the president's claims.\n\nAh, the price of eggs. Another cursed number.\n\nFood indexes are also released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and so we won't be getting an October number. I can, however, report that eggs officially dropped under the $3 mark, and you can find a grade A dozen for around $2.86 on average in November.\n\nShifting from a positive to a negative, the cost of beef is still skyrocketing, and I continue to find that giving up red meat this year was one of the best financial decisions I've made.\n\nIf you're looking for a pound of beef, prices jumped to $6.50 on average in November.\n\n(And yes, the government shutdown is still acting as the Ghost of Christmas past, and we will not be getting an October average here either.)\n\nGas is going down, though! I'm sure y'all will flood the comment section with local prices wayyyyy higher than the national average, and wish you saw numbers as low as this, but according to the Energy Information Administration, a gallon of gasoline cost around $3.179 last month.\n\nInflation dropped to its lowest point in months, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2.7% figure has raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \"For the inflation report, many economists were caught off guard by the way the B.L.S. handled the distortions, which is part of why they are casting so much doubt on the numbers published today.\"\n\nThe above is fancy speak to say that the government shutdown caused \"distortions\" in the data surrounding inflation, and so it may or may not paint a prettier picture than reality.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones neither rose nor fell in November, according to Stat Muse. So, there's that.\n\nWe're approaching a full year under Trump's second presidency, and there's still no stimulus check in sight for struggling Americans. What happened to those $2,000 tariff dividend checks Trump promised on Truth Social? I haven't heard a single word of it since Nov. 9.\n\nYIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES.

YIKES.\n\nTrump's approval rating hit an all-time low for this term. Gallup reports that only 36% of Americans approve of how Trump's second presidency is going. It's looking BLEAK.\n\nIt's not uncommon for me to see comments from conservatives who claim the data presented in this report is \"fake news.\" Usually, I point to the fact that the data is retrieved from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Energy Administration, which fall under Trump's own administration. So, if the numbers are \"fake news,\" that would mean these MAGA commenters believe Trump's people are spreading fake news...\n\nI appreciate the readership, regardless. <3\n\nAlso in In the News: 27 Photos Of Donald Trump In 2025 He Probably Reaaaaaally Doesn't Want You To See\n\nAlso in In the News: \"Oh My God\": People Are Not Holding Back AT ALL After Trump Made Another White House \"Upgrade,\" And Hoo Boy, You Gotta See This One\n\nAlso in In the News: Donald Trump Hated His Time Magazine Cover...

The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.  “This policy is not about cost or care — it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is facing a new legal complaint from a group of government employees who are affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.\n\nThe complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.\n\nThe complaint argues that denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination and asks the personnel office to rescind the policy.\n\n“This policy is not about cost or care — it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.\n\nThe complaint, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, includes testimonies from four current federal workers at the State Department, Health and Human Services and the Postal Service who would be directly affected by the elimination of coverage.\n\nFor instance, the Postal Service employee has a daughter whose doctors recommended that she get puberty blockers and potentially hormone replacement therapy for her diagnosed gender dysphoria, which would not be covered under the new OPM policy, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint notes that the workers are making the claim on behalf of themselves and a “class of similarly situated federal employees.”\n\nThe Trump administration has taken other steps to restrict care for transgender Americans, particularly minors. In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.\n\nSenior Trump officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors. But such restrictions go against recommendations from major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin’s Jan. 1 price history highlights recurring patterns of rapid growth followed by sharp corrections.\n\nDespite major drawdowns, Bitcoin has repeatedly rebounded to new highs.\n\nAnalysts say seasonal trading patterns offer limited support for a near-term rebound in 2025.\n\nBitcoin’s (BTC) price on New Year’s Day has repeatedly marked turning points in the crypto market’s volatile history, offering a snapshot of investor sentiment as markets enter each new year.\n\nA year-by-year review of Bitcoin’s Jan. 1 price highlights how periods of rapid growth and renewed optimism have built it from a fringe experiment into the mega asset it is today.\n\nBitcoin began 2015 trading near $314, reflecting a prolonged downturn following the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange and waning interest after its first major speculative cycle.\n\nPrices recovered steadily over the next two years.\n\nThat momentum culminated at the beginning of 2018, when Bitcoin opened the year near $13,657 after a historic rally in late 2017.\n\nThe surge marked the asset’s first mainstream breakthrough but also preceded a sharp reversal.\n\nBitcoin’s price fell to about $3,843 by Jan. 1, 2019, as the market unwound what many critics had labelled a speculative bubble.\n\nHowever, the decline did not mark the end of the asset’s growth.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2021, it traded near $29,374, supported by growing institutional adoption and looser global monetary conditions.\n\nThe rally continued into early 2022, with Bitcoin opening the year near $47,686, before tightening monetary policy and a series of crypto-sector failures triggered another steep downturn.\n\nBitcoin entered 2023 trading at roughly $16,625, reflecting widespread risk aversion after high-profile exchange collapses and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nPrices rebounded strongly over the following year, rising to about $44,167 at the start of 2024.\n\nBTC began 2025 at approximately $94,419, near record highs.\n\nIn 2025, technical analysts suggest that Bitcoin’s recent weakness may persist beyond the holiday period.\n\nValdrin Tahiri, an analyst at CCN, said seasonal trading patterns offer little support for a near-term reversal.",

    "description": "Our first trip to Amsterdam as a family was great, but there are mistakes I wish we avoided and tips I wish we knew before we got to the Netherlands.",
    "fullText": "I'd long imagined Amsterdam as a picturesque city of canals, tulips, and windmills.\n\nHowever, visiting for the first time with my husband and 11-year-old twins quickly showed me a few surprising realities that coexist alongside those postcard-worthy views.\n\nFrom its frenetic bike culture to its unexpected culinary influences, the city challenged some of my assumptions even as it reinforced others.\n\nHere's what surprised me most about my first time in Amsterdam.\n\nI was already aware of Amsterdam's reputation as a cycling city — thanks to its flat, compact geography.\n\nBut until you're standing at a crosswalk with hundreds of bikes whizzing by in every direction, it's hard to really internalize just how central cycling is to daily life.\n\nThere are more bikes than residents here, and riders of all ages commute with precision and speed.\n\nI spotted the littlest kids perching on handlebars (or even riding their own bikes in the street), people texting while biking, and lots of cyclists running red lights … all while tourists like us scrambled to get out of the way.\n\nLocals aren't aggressive so much as efficient per se; bikes are treated like vehicles, with their own rules and right-of-way. We learned quickly to look both ways — twice — before stepping into a lane.\n\nIt didn't take me long to realize that my idea of renting bikes for a leisurely family ride through town was not going to be the casual thing I'd thought we might be up for.\n\nTo get around, we mostly relied on Amsterdam's trams and buses. They ran on time, were comfortable, and took us pretty much everywhere we wanted to go.\n\nBut we had a major issue on our way out of town: Since our family of four had lots of luggage for a two-week jaunt through multiple European cities, we called an Uber to get us to the train station when it was time to leave.\n\nThis turned out to be a disaster. We left with what we thought should have been plenty of time, but we got stuck in gridlock traffic for far longer than anticipated.\n\nFinally, we ended up jumping out of the unmoving car mid-ride and into a bus (with all our luggage), which we hoped would get us to the train station faster, since they have dedicated lanes.\n\nBut by then, it was too late; we ultimately missed our train. At least now I understand why so many locals skip cars entirely.\n\nAt our hotel, I asked the concierge for local recommendations for a celebratory dinner on the evening of my twins' birthday.\n\nShe explained that many traditional Dutch foods are prepared in people's homes, so there isn't as huge of a dining-out culture for this cuisine as I'd expected. So she recommended we get a traditional meal of \"rijsttafel,\" or \"rice table,\" at an Indonesian restaurant.\n\nRijsttafel is a Dutch-Indonesian feast born of the country's colonial ties to Indonesia — the Netherlands colonized Indonesia for roughly 350 years.\n\nIt's presented family-style, with tons of small dishes in the middle of the table for sampling, and served with rice — think satay, rendang, sambal (chili pastes), and vegetables.\n\nThe variety lets us sample a wide range of flavors, textures, and spices. It was incredible.\n\nAmsterdam has a strong reputation for its permissive sex and drug culture, which we didn't seek out on a family trip. However, this vibe did seep into things like naughty souvenirs and street art, which slightly raised a couple of tween eyebrows.\n\nThat said, we generally found Amsterdam to be incredibly family-friendly. The walkable, compact city is filled with cultural attractions and parks, so even with kids in tow, it didn't feel overwhelming.\n\nMy twins were able to navigate on foot, hop easily on trams, explore the sprawling Vondelpark greenspace, and sample kid-friendly treats, such as warm stroopwafels, from street vendors.\n\nAside from obvious venues for adults, we didn't come across many spots where visitors had to be a certain age to step inside, which helped our whole family feel included. Kids seemed to be welcome all over, even in restaurants and pubs where we might not expect to see them back home in the US.",

    "fullText": "Living rooms are often considered the heart of the home, serving as a versatile space for hosting guests, spending quality time with loved ones, and relaxing after a long day.\n\nSo, if there's any room in your house that should feel warm, inviting, and full of personal touches, it should be this one.\n\nWith that in mind, Business Insider asked five interior designers to share insight on what will be popular in living rooms this coming year, and which fads are on their way out.\n\nHere's what they predict will be in and out for living rooms in 2026.\n\nAccording to Candace Griffin, principal designer and founder of Candace Mary Interiors, color capping will be a popular living-room trend this year.\n\nUnlike color drenching, which covers an entire room's walls in a single hue, color capping uses multiple shades from the same tone to create movement, depth, and a more polished look.\n\n\"Color capping can sometimes be used to draw your eye up, to make your ceilings feel taller,\" Griffin said. \"… It serves a functional purpose, but also just gives you another opportunity to have some fun in the space.\"\n\nUltra-glam light fixtures will also lose popularity to soft, antique-style lamps in 2026, said Kara Thomas, interior designer and founder of Studio KT.\n\nThat said, the trend toward unique antiques will extend beyond lamps and sconces.\n\n\"I think the desire to fill a home with antiques and thoughtfully sourced items stems from a desire to be more unique, especially with the internet flooded with a lot of rinse-and-repeat ideas,\" Thomas said.\n\nFor that reason, she believes we will see more rustic decor, mixed metals, and vintage artwork and frames in living rooms this year.\n\nInterior designer Molly Torres Portnof of DATE Interiors said she predicts a shift toward more distinctive, intimate, and creative layouts.\n\nThis could look like incorporating a cozy reading nook or a small playroom for the kids into your living room.\n\n\"If you have the space to create separate conversation areas, you can get creative with those corners and niches,\" Griffin added. \"[It's] really just maximizing every inch of the space and not feeling like you have to be in a box, per se.\"\n\nHandmade, wooden furniture and handwoven textiles will be everywhere in 2026, according to Molly Miller, principal designer and founder of Molly Miller Interiors.\n\n\"These elements add depth and authenticity that mass-produced items simply can't match,\" she said.\n\nThese particular elements are also becoming increasingly important as people gravitate toward home spaces that feel inviting, timeless, and emotionally calming, Miller added.\n\nOftentimes, people want to put a mirror on the wall or above their fireplace, but feel like they don't have the room to fit it next to a TV.\n\nWith that in mind, Torres Portnof said she's excited about the possibility of mirror TVs taking over living-room spaces.\n\nAs the name suggests, a mirror TV looks like a sleek, framed mirror when turned off and appears like a high-definition television when turned on.\n\n\"I love the fact that it's dual-purpose, and I think others will as well,\" she said.\n\nAs more people turn toward designs that evoke warmth and comfort, designers expect soothing, earthy palettes to become everyone's go-to choice for living-room colors.\n\n\"Everything is leaning more toward earthy tones,\" said Thomas. In particular, she sees burgundy, deep browns, olive greens, and darker blues taking over living rooms this year and beyond.\n\nDanielle Chiprut, interior designer and founder of Danielle Rose Design Co., believes that bland, cold-feeling spaces are becoming outdated.\n\nInstead, she predicts a growing shift toward heavily textured living-room designs with warmer colors, patterned sofas, and personalized elements.\n\n\"We're moving away from that minimalist, modern design and into a more layered, cozy [layout],\" Chiprut said.\n\nFurthermore, as living rooms become less sterile and showroom-like, Griffin is also seeing a general pull toward spaces that feel truly \"lived in.\"\n\n\"The real way to achieve that is by taking your time and incorporating the things that you like and that are important to you,\" she added.\n\nFor example, when it comes to artwork, she recommends building a collection over time and avoiding mass-produced pieces.",

    "description": "Afters years of talk, governments in Australia, France, and more are taking action to ban social-media for kids. Some warn of unintended effects.",
    "fullText": "After years of discussion, 2026 is shaping up to be the year when governments around the world take action on kids using social media.\n\nAustralia, France, Denmark, and Norway are advancing or planning social-media bans for young people under a certain age. In the US, a patchwork of state-based efforts is likely to face tougher prospects.\n\nThe changes come as concerns mount over the toll that platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat can take on young people's mental health.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, in a New Year's Eve speech, reiterated his support for banning social media for children and young teens — setting the tone for what could be a landmark year for such efforts worldwide.\n\n\"We will protect our children and teenagers from social media and screens,\" he said.\n\nWorld leaders have talked for years about restricting children's access to social media. Now, that talk is crystallizing into action. Australia became the first major nation to impose a social-media ban for children under 16. Its law took effect in December.\n\nMacron wants France to follow Australia's example. Bills in the works would restrict access for children under 15 starting next fall, timed to coincide with the start of the new academic year.\n\nThe Malaysian government has said it intends to implement a similar ban this year. Denmark is also planning a ban for children under 15, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced in October, warning that \"never before have so many children and young people suffered from anxiety and depression.\" Norway, too, is considering similar measures, though its prime minister acknowledged it would be a challenge to enforce.\n\nIn India, high court judges suggested in December that the country consider legislation modeled on Australia's approach.\n\nSocial media executives have criticized bans on their products, touting their own safeguards, questioning the feasibility of such measures, and warning of unintended consequences.\n\nAs for the Australian law, Google and Meta had both called for a delay in its implementation. They said the government should rely on an age-verification system, which had been under trial before the new law took effect.\n\n\"We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them,\" a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider last year in response to EU discussion on young people and social media.\n\nElon Musk, owner of X, criticized Australia's legislation, calling it \"a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\" TikTok expressed \"significant concerns\" with the legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, a nationwide effort in the US — the birthplace of the world's largest social media companies — faces an uphill battle.\n\nWhile lawmakers in Congress have floated proposals to restrict young people's access, none have passed. Instead, the push has largely shifted to the states, where a patchwork of age-verification rules, parental-consent laws, and time limits is advancing, often amid legal challenges.\n\nVirginia is set to impose a one-hour daily limit on social-media use for children under 16 unless parents opt out, a law that is scheduled to take effect this year but is already facing legal challenges. Nebraska recently passed legislation requiring parental consent for minors to open social-media accounts. Other states, including Utah and Florida, have advanced age-verification or parental-consent laws that have been delayed or blocked in court.\n\nSome states are targeting smartphones, rather than just social media, imposing \"bell-to-bell\" bans on cellphones at public schools.\n\nAttorneys general from 14 states sued TikTok in October, saying the app is addictive and profits from damaging the mental health of children. TikTok has disputed that its products harm kids, defending its own internal safeguards.\n\nWhile momentum is gathering for efforts to protect children from social media, some industry watchers have cautioned that such efforts aren't a magic fix and could have unexpected knock-on effects.\n\n\"While UNICEF welcomes the growing commitment to children's online safety, social media bans come with their own risks, and they may even backfire,\" UNICEF, the United Nations agency focused on children, said in a December statement, noting that some marginalized children rely on social media and that others may find workarounds or flock to darker corners of the internet.",

    "title": "What it's like visiting the island of St. Barts — a beloved party spot for billionaires and their superyachts",
    "description": "St. Barthelemy, or St. Barts, is a French-speaking Caribbean island with beaches and high-end shops where billionaires like Jeff Bezos vacation.",
    "fullText": "Located in the French West Indies, the small island runs about 11 miles long and 2.5 miles wide.\n\nIt's typically warm and sunny most of the year, with temperatures often in the 70s, 80s, or low 90s, and peak tourist season starts in late fall and lasts through the spring.\n\nAs a French territory, the official language of St. Barts is French, though English is also widely spoken.\n\nThe exclusive-feeling island is home to more than a dozen beaches, where visitors can soak up the sun on smooth, sandy shores and in crystal-clear water.\n\n\"I always say if you want to have your toes in the sand and eat a croissant that feels like you're in Paris, St. Barts is the place for you,\" Elisabeth Brown, the membership director at the luxury concierge service Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider's Madeline Berg.\n\nSurrounded by shallow coral reefs, St. Barts has some top-tier snorkeling spots, such as Grand Cul-de-Sac — home to sea turtles and a range of tropical fish.\n\nLocal natural sights also include mountains and hills formed from volcanic eruptions. That said, there are no active volcanoes on St. Barts.\n\nJeff Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez Bezos, were photographed in St. Barts this week — and the Amazon founder has been spotted in St. Barts on multiple occasions over the years.\n\nNo matter the time of year, though, the island regularly welcomes the wealthy.\n\nCelebrities like Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, and Leonardo DiCaprio have visited in the past, and influential banking families, like the Rothschilds, have famously purchased property there.\n\nIn addition to Bezos' vessel, massive yachts owned by Playrix founder Dmitry Bukhman, Dallas Mavericks owner Miriam Adelson, and entertainment mogul David Geffen also parked in St. Barts during the recent holiday.\n\nWhile the yachts are primarily used for transportation to the island, they're also attractions in and of themselves, featuring amenities such as jacuzzis and movie theaters.\n\nTravelers without private yachts can still reach the island by flying into an airport on a larger Caribbean island, like San Juan. From there, they could take a ferry or private boat to St Barts.\n\nVisitors have several options for accommodations, ranging from villa rentals starting at over $900 a night to luxurious hotels for an even higher price.\n\nThe Eden Rock hotel is just one example. It overlooks St. Jean Bay — home to one of the most popular beaches on St. Barts — and is home to fine-dining restaurants and holistic spas.\n\nDuring holiday seasons like New Year's, a single-night stay at its largest villa can cost upward of €13,000, or about $15,200.\n\nThere's also the Rosewood Le Guanahani resort, located on a private peninsula that's home to two secluded beaches, giving travelers the ultimate getaway far from crowds.\n\nSuch privacy comes at a price, as even its most basic room can run guests thousands of dollars a night.\n\nWith billionaire travelers always on-site, the island's retail scene largely caters to shoppers who can drop thousands at any given moment.\n\nSome of the designer brands that have boutiques on St. Barts include Hermès, Cartier, Dior, and Louis Vuitton.\n\nThe island's also home to luxury retailers like Patek Phillipe, which sells one-of-a-kind timepieces you can't find anywhere else. Some retail for five, six, and even seven figures.\n\nA trip to St. Barts isn't all about relaxation, though. There are plenty of places to party and experience live music.\n\nOne of the most popular spots for this on the island is Nikki Beach, an upscale restaurant and beach club. In past years, big-name musicians like Kygo and Mariah Carey have even performed at its New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nIt's also a go-to for people looking to relax poolside with a drink in hand — though keep in mind that even just renting a lounge chair may cost you over $100.",

    "description": "AI data centers are soaking up key components, raising the risk of higher smartphone and PC prices for consumers in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Your smartphone's price might increase in 2026 — and you'll have AI to thank for that.\n\nAccording to a December 2025 report from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC), the manufacturing of Random Access Memory (RAM), used to store data in devices such as computers and phones, is being reallocated to support AI data centers, rather than being incorporated into phones and PCs.\n\nJust as your smartphone runs faster with more memory available, so do AI data centers. As more companies rely on AI tools, the importance of reliable processing power increases, leading to the increased usage of more RAM.\n\nIDC expects DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) supply growth to be below historical norms in 2026 at 16% year-on-year.\n\nAs the hunt for affordable RAM becomes increasingly challenging for smartphone manufacturers like Apple, Google, and Samsung, their costs are likely to rise, which could impact the prices they charge consumers.\n\n\"In the case of the upcoming memory crisis, this is something that will hit the market hard,\" IDC senior research director Nabila Popal told CNET in December. \"Those vendors will have almost no choice but to pass the increased cost to consumers.\"\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint also expects a slower year for all phone manufacturers. The firm projects global smartphone shipments to decrease 2.1% in 2026.\n\nThe firm's research suggests that the price for memory could increase 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as a device's memory can represent anywhere from 10% to 20% of the total bill of materials.\n\nLarger manufacturers with a broader range of products offered, in terms of price, should fare better than others, according to Counterpoint senior analyst Yang Wang, while lower-end markets will likely be hit the hardest.\n\n\"Apple and Samsung are best positioned to weather the next few quarters,\" Wang said. \"But it will be tough for others that don't have as much wiggle room to manage market share versus profit margins.\n\nEven still, Counterpoint predicts that average selling prices will increase by 6.9%. For people looking to buy the iPhone 17 Max base model, that could mean eventually paying closer to $1,281, up from the $1,199 price tag announced in 2025.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nRobin Roefs (Sunderland): I think he has arguably been the signing of the season. Unbelievable the way he keeps performing to that same level and standard. He kept Sunderland in it against Manchester City with three or four great saves. The way that he has been playing and that backline has been playing, I could have just put that whole backline in. They were excellent and I thought he epitomised that.\n\nTrai Hume (Sunderland): We talk about Granit Xhaka, we talk about Roefs and we have spoken about individuals like Dan Ballard and the like but I think Hume has been their best performer throughout the whole course of it. Nobody is really talking about it.\n\nJaka Bijol (Leeds): At Anfield, everyone would have expected Liverpool to really, really do a job on this team here and make sure that they were ready to go. Unfortunately, Leeds are flying high. They defended resolutely and rode their luck, there was a massive chance for Hugo Ekitike to score and he probably should have but Leeds are in a good vein of form and Bijol has been an unsung hero.\n\nNathan Collins (Brentford): The game against Spurs was poor and the abilities and the attacking threat was poor. It was a defensive unit for both but I thought Nathan Collins was arguably the best defender on the pitch. Brentford continue their opportunity to stay in the league and that is going to be based on how defensively solid they are.\n\nMartin Zubimendi (Arsenal): Arsenal signed Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke and all of these other players that people were looking at. Probably their best bit of business was getting Zubimendi in early doors. He dictates the play, he's chipping in with a few goals as well now but he's really important to the way that they conduct themselves.\n\nJames Garner (Everton): He has played right-back, left-back, centre midfield, right midfield, you name it. He will play anywhere that Everton ask him to play. He does a job, not only is he a solid pro and a good kid but he never complains. When he's on the bench he doesn't complain, when he's playing he doesn't demand contracts and wages and things of that nature. A goal and an assist for him obviously helped Everton get a wonderful 2-0 victory at Nottingham Forest and he was a huge part of that.\n\nJoelinton (Newcastle): Is there a more dominant midfielder in the Premier League? I'll wait. 6ft 4in, can run all over you, can fight with you but also can do what he did against Burnley and score a goal after two minutes that was worthy of winning any game.\n\nDavid Brooks (Bournemouth): Brooks was the best player on the pitch for me against Chelsea by a country mile. He scored but it was just the way he took Bournemouth up the pitch. There are a lot of eyes on Antoine Semenyo and that he is probably leaving but I just thought that Brooks was fantastic in the way that he carries the ball and he will be the person who carries Bournemouth, not only to safety but to whatever position they end up in this season, it will be on his shoulders.\n\nLeandro Trossard (Arsenal): It's amazing to think that they were going to let him go. There was talk at the start of the season that he was going to be the one to come under the PSR rules. For me, he could be Arsenal's unsung hero of the year. He's now solved that left-sided problem which was an area with Gabriel Martinelli, then they brought Noni Madueke in, they tried Eberechi Eze out there. He's the starting left-sided player, it's just a given. Another goal, an emphatic goal but his work-rate and energy for the team is what's most impressive for me.\n\nYoane Wissa (Newcastle): First goal in two games. He's had a tough start since he got in to Newcastle after being injured but as a spark, he has a willingness to work for his team and an infectious personality that makes everybody else run if he is running. He's always smiling so that's why he gets in the team.\n\nJarrod Bowen (West Ham): When people talk about Bruno Fernandes, the first thing they say is where would Manchester United be without him? Where would West Ham be without Jarrod Bowen over the past five years? Honestly, the guy just keeps performing, takes the brunt of it as the captain and the face of West Ham. He knows what comes with that and the pressures that come with that but he keeps delivering and performing. Another goal for him in the draw with Brighton. If West Ham are to be safe this season, they'll rely on him heavily.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): Unbelievable result. Everyone looking at Arsenal coming up against an Aston Villa team that is in form and flying and looking at it as if they were going to struggle due to Declan Rice being out an a few others. It felt like this was a moment where Arsenal could potentially struggle. They didn't, Arteta found a way to win. It wasn't as easy as the scoreline suggested when you look at the first half chances for Villa. However, it was a massive win and a massive statement, especially when you look at Man City dropping a couple of points away at high-flying Sunderland.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "fullText": "Fulham manager Marco Silva has called for a review of the rules around players needing treatment for head injuries, after his side conceded a goal when temporarily reduced to 10 men in their 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace.\n\nReferee Tony Harrington asked Jorge Cuenca to leave the pitch for treatment after the Fulham defender appeared to put his hands to his face after being caught by a stray arm of Palace's Justin Devenny.\n\nCuenca was unhappy with the referee's decision, but walked off the pitch before play restarted.\n\nOliver Glasner's side then took the lead through a header from Jean-Philippe Mateta just a few seconds later, while Cuenca was waiting on the touchline.\n\nPremier League rules were changed before the 2024-25 season and state that should a player need to leave the field for treatment on a suspected head injury, he must remain off for a minimum of 30 seconds after play has restarted.\n\n\"We conceded a goal when the game was completely under control, and I really believe that at that moment we should not have been playing with 10 men,\" said Silva.\n\n\"Football is to be played 11 against 11. We cannot be always calling the medical stuff when it's not necessary to do it.\n\n\"I told the official because it's happening too often. I think they should review that they should analyse that.\"",

    "fullText": "Strasbourg manager Liam Rosenior is the leading contender for the Chelsea job vacated by Enzo Maresca.\n\nFormer Leicester boss Maresca, 45, left his role as Chelsea head coach on Thursday amid internal tensions with the club's hierarchy and ownership.\n\nThe process to replace the Italian is under way, and it is understood Englishman Rosenior is the frontrunner, though sources have stressed other candidates are also under consideration.\n\nRosenior's current employers are owned by investment vehicle BlueCo - the consortium set up to purchase Chelsea in 2022.\n\nThe 41-year-old, who previously managed Hull, has significant backing internally at Chelsea and it is understood candidates to replace him at Strasbourg are being considered because of his possible departure.\n\nPorto's Francesco Farioli has also been mooted as a potential contender.\n\nBefore appointing Maresca in 2024, Chelsea interviewed Marseille manager Roberto de Zerbi, Ipswich counterpart Kieran McKenna, and Thomas Frank, who was then at Brentford but has since moved to Tottenham.\n\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola and Fulham's Marco Silva have also been linked with the role in the past, though it is unclear if they are now contenders.\n\nThe club will not change their style of play, so it is highly unlikely they would move for Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner.\n\nChelsea Under-21s head coach Calum McFarlane will lead the side for Sunday's match against Manchester City, and is on media duties for a news conference to preview the game on Friday.\n\nA social media post from goalkeeper Robert Sanchez indicated that Maresca's backroom team have also departed the club.",

    "description": "As Liverpool are booed off following a goalless draw against Leeds, it was hardly the start to the New Year that Arne Slot's side would have wanted.",
    "fullText": "As the full-time whistle went at Anfield, a goalless draw against Leeds United prompted some boos from sections of the home support.\n\nIt was the first time Liverpool had drawn 0-0 under Arne Slot, and the first result of that scoreline in 117 matches in all competitions, since December 2023 against Manchester United.\n\nLiverpool had not lost and Slot's side had extended their unbeaten run to eight games. But after a largely dull display, it showed a fanbase sharing their frustrations.\n\nFar too often this season, Liverpool have been a tough football team to watch.\n\nIt is not an overstatement to say that the Anfield crowd has been spoiled over the past decade from the Jurgen Klopp era to Slot winning the title in his first year at the club.\n\nThe standards are immensely high and rightly so for a club of this magnitude, but against a Leeds side who got promoted to the Premier League last season, Liverpool looked one-dimensional and lacked the quality to break through the visitors and their 5-4-1 setup.\n\nBar Jeremie Frimpong, who had the pace to move past some of the Leeds players with ease but perhaps lacked that final delivery, there were few moments which got the fans off their seats.\n\nIt was hardly the start to the New Year that Liverpool, Slot or the Anfield faithful would have desired.\n\nOne BBC Sport reader summed up the feelings of the fanbase in our live text.\n\n\"Liverpool still look as though there's a piece missing,\" said Jan from Rye.\n\n\"Heavy metal football this is not - it's not even aluminium foil football.\"",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola questioned whether it was only a two-horse Premier League title race, but his Manchester City side can ill-afford many slip-ups in their quest to hunt down leaders Arsenal.\n\nMikel Arteta's Gunners have struck the latest blow in this cat and mouse chase, four points clear at the summit following City's frustrating goalless draw at Sunderland on Thursday night.\n\nCity dropped points as the temperature at the Stadium of Light almost hit freezing on the first day of 2026.\n\nAnd Arsenal will need to maintain their cool if they are to claim their first top-flight crown in over two decades.\n\nCity had 67% possession and 14 shots in the North East, but were unable to break down a stubborn Sunderland defence who claimed a well-earned point.\n\n\"Two different halves,\" said City captain Bernardo Silva after the game. \"In the first half we didn't play that well. We didn't control the counter as well as we should.\n\n\"We attacked a bit too quick - we didn't move them to find spaces. Second half we had a lot more chances and today was one of those days we couldn't finish them.\n\n\"We are not happy because we wanted better than this.\"\n\nAs goalless draws go, this was an thoroughly entertaining one with both teams having chances to claim all three points.\n\nThe home fans grew in confidence as the match wore on but City could not find the key to unlock the defence as Sunderland maintained their impressive unbeaten record at home this season.\n\n\"If you look at Sunderland's home record I think it's a point well-earned,\" former Manchester City defender Steph Houghton said on BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"They [City] will overall be disappointed because of the chances they created but if you look at the likes of Arsenal and Aston Villa, to go there and get a point, we are half way through the season, there is a long, long way to go.\"\n\nJust like Arsenal in November, City could not beat the Black Cats.\n\nAnd Sunderland boss Regis le Bris was understandably delighted by the result, saying: \"I'm enjoying [it]. I think we showed strong character against probably one of the best teams in Europe at the minute.\n\n\"It was important to defend well. I think we were bold because we tried to be aggressive and high up the pitch. I think we disturbed their routine, maybe their flow and it was really important.\n\n\"We created a few chances as well, so it was a good game.\"",
