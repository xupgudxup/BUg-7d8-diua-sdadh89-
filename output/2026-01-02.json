    "fullText": "Just one day after Iowa beat Vanderbilt in the ReliaQuest Bowl, the program received some unexpected news.\n\nThe NCAA transfer portal officially opens on Friday, but players can announce their intention to enter the portal now. The Hawkeyes have seen a couple of current players do just that, most notably sophomore running back Terrell Washington Jr. That was an expected move, as Iowa possesses a logjam of talent in the backfield, and Washington Jr. could easily get more playing time elsewhere.\n\nIowa saw another player announce their intentions to enter the transfer portal on Thursday, but this one caught many people by surprise. Sophomore punter Rhys Dakin took to X on Thursday with a statement announcing that he's planning to enter the transfer portal and to depart the program.\n\nThankyou, Iowa ❤️ pic.twitter.com/2U9DRZsZvs\n\n— Rhys Dakin (@Rhys_dak1n) January 1, 2026\n\nThis was a shocking announcement from Dakin, who many expected to return to Iowa City for his junior season in 2026. The sophomore had 42 punts in 2025, averaging 43.6 yards per punt with a long of 65 yards. That average was slightly down from his freshman year, when he was an All-Big Ten third-team selection by the media and second-team by the coaches.\n\nDakin had big shoes to fill, coming in immediately after Tory Taylor went to the NFL, and the young Aussie showed a lot of promise. He was coming off one of his best games of the season in the ReliaQuest Bowl, where he punted three times with a 49-yard average per punt. And now he's set to look for opportunities elsewhere.\n\nDakin's departure adds to the losses for the Iowa special teams unit heading into next season. Kicker Drew Stevens and return specialist Kaden Wetjen are set to graduate and move on, while special teams coordinator LeVar Woods is off to East Lansing to join Pat Fitzgerald's coaching staff. The Hawkeyes are going to have a lot of work to do in the portal and recruiting this offseason to replace the production walking out the door.\n\nIowa doesn't have another punter on the roster currently with eligibility for 2026, so Kirk Ferentz and company will look to the portal to find their next guy at that position. If there's one thing fans should trust Ferentz with, it's his commitment to the importance of special teams.\n\nWhile Dakin is a surprising and big loss, fans should believe in the coaching staff to find the right replacement.\n\nContact/Follow us @HawkeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Iowa news, notes and opinions. Follow Zach on X: @zach_hiney\n\nThis article originally appeared on Hawkeyes Wire: Iowa football punter Rhys Dakin to enter transfer portal",

    "fullText": "Indiana football made quite an emphatic statement in its College Football Playoff Rose Bowl quarterfinal matchup against No. 9 Alabama.\n\nBehind a three-touchdown afternoon from Fernando Mendoza and some relentless defense, the top-seeded Hoosiers embarrassed the ninth-seeded Crimson Tide 38-3 in \"The Granddaddy of Them All\" on Thursday, Jan. 1 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California to advance to their first CFP semifinal.\n\nThe Hoosiers' dominant \"business trip\" to the Rose Bowl made some history, as it is tied for the fourth-largest blowout win in the history of the College Football Playoff and the worst loss Alabama has sustained since 1998. It is the first bowl win for the Hoosiers since the 1991 Copper Bowl.\n\nWho's in CFP semifinals? Updated bracket, scores for College Football Playoff\n\nA 17-0 halftime lead for Indiana quickly snowballed into a 38-3 lead for the Hoosiers following Roman Hemby's 18-yard rushing touchdown at the 10:33 mark of the fourth quarter. Mendoza's 1-yard pass to Omar Cooper Jr. with 17 seconds remaining in the second quarter started a four-consecutive drive stretch for the Hoosiers where they scored a touchdown\n\nWith its win, Indiana now heads to Atlanta for another date against No. 5 Oregon on Friday, Jan. 9 in the CFP Peach Bowl semifinal, where the Hoosiers will look to beat the Ducks for the second time this season.\n\nHere's what to know on the biggest blowout win in College Football Playoff history:\n\nGeorgia owns the record for the biggest blowout win in the history of the College Football Playoff at 58 points against TCU in the 2022-23 CFP Championship game. The Bulldogs surpassed Oregon's previous record against Florida State in the 2015 Rose Bowl with a 39-point margin win.\n\nWith its win in the Rose Bowl, Indiana surpassed Penn State for the record for the biggest blowout win in the 12-team CFP era at 35 points. The Nittany Lions previously held it at 28 points from its 38-10 first-round win over SMU last season at Beaver Stadium in Happy Valley.\n\nHere's a look at the top 10 biggest blowout wins in the history of the College Football Playoff, including where Indiana's 35-point win over Alabama ranks amongst them:\n\n1.

    "fullText": "JJ Redick leans on advice from legendary Lakers coach amid losing stretch originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have lost four of their last five games and are approaching the point in the season where many of their flaws need to be addressed. Their 128-106 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday raised questions of whether or not the team has developed an identity yet.\n\nThe Lakers once again were dominated by an opponent's athleticism, and it prompted head coach JJ Redick to reflect on a conversation he had with Hall of Fame Lakers coach Phil Jackson last season.\n\n\"Think about our team last year, this team is different,\" Redick said. \"Our identity will eventually be different. We didn't get that identity until late January, it felt like, and then we had to shift again.\n\n\"I don't think it's unnatural. I remember a meeting I had with Phil last year, pretty early in the season. And he said, 'I always felt like I knew who my team was by Thanksgiving.' I think that's hard to figure out with this team right now.\"\n\nLos Angeles hasn't been afforded the best bill of health this season. As LeBron James pointed out post game when asked a similar question pertaining to the team's identity, the Lakers have only played one or two games with their full roster.\n\nNot only did James miss the first few weeks of the season, but Austin Reaves is now sidelined for at least a month with a calf strain. Promising rookie Adou Thiero is out for a month with an MCL sprain just as he was starting to find his role on the back end of Redick's rotation.\n\nIt's not hard to see why the Lakers have struggled to find an identity through 30 games, even if, as Redick points out, it's a cop-out or excuse. Los Angeles hasn't been healthy enough to even begin laying the foundation of a true identity.",

Offensively, the Crimson Tide couldn't find any momentum in Pasadena.\n\nIndiana won 38-3, one of the worst CFP performances for the Crimson Tide in the illustrious history of its football program.\n\nHere's where Thursday's Rose Bowl loss ranks among Alabama's lowest-scoring CFP games ever.\n\nMORE: The biggest blowouts in College Football Playoff history\n\nAlabama has now played in a total of 15 College Football Playoff games since the format was introduced in 2014. Previously, only twice have the Crimson Tide failed to break 20 points in those CFP games.\n\nThursday's loss was the lowest-scoring Alabama performance in a playoff game. Before losing 38-3 to Indiana, Alabama's lowest-scoring performance in a CFP game was 16 points in the 2019 national championship. In that game, the Crimson Tide lost 44-16 to Clemson.\n\nHere are Alabama's lowest-scoring CFP games.\n\nAlabama barely avoided a shutout against Indiana, only notching a field goal over four quarters. The team hasn't been shut out in a game in 25 years; the last time the Crimson Tide failed to score in any game was on Nov. 18, 2000, when Auburn blanked Alabama 9-0 in the Iron Bowl.\n\nThe Tigers needed just three field goals in Tuscaloosa to claim their win, as their defense shut out the Crimson Tide. That was Mike DuBose's final game coaching Alabama before Dennis Franchione took over in 2001.\n\nMORE: Where Alabama ranks among all-time winningest college football teams\n\nNot only did Alabama allow 38 points and 413 yards of offense to Indiana, but the total numbers for the Crimson Tide offense were also rough.\n\nTy Simpson threw for 67 yards on 12 completions before backup quarterback Austin Mack went 11-for-16 with 103 passing yards. On the day, the Crimson Tide ran for just 23 yards on 17 carries for an average of 1.4 yards per carry, converting on three of 11 third-down opportunities.",

It usually does that only after a contract or memorandum of understanding is signed.\n\nJackson's position is unknown, but his background suggests it will be in the defensive front seven.\n\nIn 2025, Jackson served as a defensive analyst and assistant defensive line coach at Penn State, where he worked under Knowles.\n\nJackson was the defensive line coach at Fordham (2017), Old Dominion (2020) and West Virginia (2021-24). He was a defensive quality control coach at Mississippi State (2018) and defensive tackles coach at James Madison (2019). And he was also a Penn State defensive line graduate assistant (2015-16).\n\nJackson worked under Knowles at Penn State in the 2025 season. In December, Tennessee coach Josh Heupel hired Knowles to replace fired defensive coordinator Tim Banks.\n\nTennessee currently has three position coaches in the front seven of the defense. Defensive line coach Rodney Garner's contract expires Jan. 31, 2026, but he is expected to sign an extension. Outside linebackers/edge rushers coach Levorn \"Chop\" Harbin and linebacker coach William Inge each have a contract through January 2027.\n\nBut UT also has an extensive staff of analysts, so Jackson could fill a role there, as well.\n\nAdam Sparks is the Tennessee football beat reporter.

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Alabama rallied from a 17-point deficit once in the College Football Playoff, but there would not be a repeat performance against No. 1 Indiana in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Crimson Tide tried everything possible to stage a historic comeback on the site of so many memorable moments for the program, from a 1926 win that marked the arrival of southern football as a powerhouse on par with the rest of the country, to a 2024 overtime loss that would be legendary head coach Nick Saban's final game, but not even benching star quarterback Ty Simpson in the second half could provide a spark in a 38-3 loss to the Hoosiers.\n\nThe cracks that had been evident throughout a tumultuous season, from the shock opening loss to Florida State that only got worse as the year went on to why Alabama (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) found itself trailing by three scores against Oklahoma in the first round on Dec. 19, finally brought the inevitable conclusion for a talented, but flawed, team.\n\nWithout the benefit of any semblance of a running game, Simpson struggled to create big plays against Indiana's stout defense, going 12 of 16 for 67 yards and running for 17 yards with a lost fumble. The desperation to keep up with Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza had Alabama going for it on fourth down from its own 34 early in the second quarter, leading to an odd Wildcat pop pass that was stopped short.\n\nAustin Mack, who followed head coach Kalen DeBoer from Washington to Alabama before the 2024 season, took over late in the third quarter and managed a field goal on his first drive. That was as much as the third-year sophomore could muster, ending up 11 of 16 for 103 yards with three sacks.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "Biggest College Football Playoff blowouts: Here are the largest margins of victory in CFP history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe nature of the College Football Playoff is to pin the best teams in the country against one another, allowing debates over the best squad to be settled in the race for a national championship.\n\nWith 136 FBS teams, the selection process for the CFP can be controversial, but for the most part, only the elite teams wind up competing in the playoff bracket. Every once in a while though, that doesn't matter much, as a CFP matchup becomes a one-sided affair.\n\nFrom the 2023 national championship game, to some lighter first-round opponents in the first-ever 12-team CFP in 2024, there have been some significant blowouts in the history of college football's postseason.\n\nHere are the 13 biggest blowouts in the history of the College Football Playoff.\n\nMORE: How every Heisman Trophy winner fared in the NFL\n\nThe biggest blowout in CFP history came in a title game, as in 2023, Georgia bludgeoned TCU 65-7 to win the national championship. While the Horned Frogs had made the game by beating Michigan 51-45 in the semifinal, they found no such luck against the Bulldogs.\n\nThe 58-point victory for Georgia wasn't just the most lopsided win in a CFP title game; it marked the biggest win in any title game, and at the time, it was the largest margin of victory in any bowl game at the FBS level.\n\nAs the Bulldogs repeated as the champions and completed a 15-0 season, Stetson Bennett threw for 304 yards and four touchdowns, adding another two scores on the ground. Branson Robinson scored twice on the ground, Kendall Milton had a rushing touchdown, Ladd McConkey caught two touchdowns and Brock Bowers and Adonai Mitchell both caught one pass in the end zone — all while TCU scored just one first-quarter touchdown.\n\nMORE: Revisiting the infamous Uga-Bevo attack video with Texas and Georgia\n\nFinal Score: Oregon 59, Florida State 20\n\nA Pac-12-ACC matchup came in the 2015 Rose Bowl, as second-seeded Oregon took on third-seeded Florida State in Pasadena. Unfortunately for the Seminoles, the CFP semifinal game was all Ducks.\n\nOregon beat the defending national champs 59-20, advancing to the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship Game. In the game, the Ducks totaled 639 total yards, including 301 rushing, breaking the record for the most points (59) scored in a Rose Bowl.\n\nMarcus Mariota had 338 passing yards, two touchdown passes, one interception and a rushing touchdown in the win, while Thomas Tyner and Royce Freeman added four more scores on the ground. The Ducks went on to fall by 22 points to Ohio State in the championship.\n\nMORE:Complete history of Lee Corso's College GameDay headgear picks\n\nFinal Score: Alabama 38, Michigan State 0\n\nAlabama was an established powerhouse under Nick Saban by 2015, and he continued flexing his coaching muscles in that year's College Football Playoff. Matched up against Michigan State in the semifinal, the Crimson Tide made light work of the Spartans.\n\nWhile most of Alabama's work was done in the second half, including Jake Coker's two touchdown passes to Calvin Ridley. Derrick Henry was his typical dominant self as well, running for 75 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAlabama picked off MSU quarterback Connor Cook twice, controlling the game from start to finish as it advanced to the title game.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 16 greatest Alabama players of all time\n\nFinal Score: LSU 63, Oklahoma 28\n\nThere's a reason the 2019 LSU Tigers are considered one of the best teams in college football history. In their semifinal playoff game, the Tigers exploded for 63 points against the country's fourth-ranked team, Oklahoma.\n\nEven by the end of the first quarter, LSU led 21-7, and by halftime, it was 49-14. The Sooners simply could not contain Joe Burrow and Ed Orgeron's offense; on the day, Burrow had 493 passing yards and an unreal seven touchdown passes, tying the NCAA records for touchdown passes in a half and touchdown passes in a bowl game. Burrow also ran for an eighth touchdown.\n\nJustin Jefferson caught four of Burrow's touchdowns, setting a College Football Playoff record, Terrace Marshall Jr. had two and Thaddeus Moss had another.\n\nMORE: Most NFL Draft picks by a school in one year\n\nFinal Score: Indiana 38, Alabama 3\n\nTo open their 2026 College Football Playoff run, Indiana, one of the all-time worst football programs in college football history, was tasked with one of the best all-time programs: Alabama. History didn't matter very much in the CFP quarterfinal game.\n\nIndiana stampeded through Alabama, 38-3, stymying Kalen DeBoer's offense all day while Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes. The Hoosiers advanced to the semifinal with the victory, becoming the title favorite with defending champion Ohio State's loss.\n\nAlabama totaled just three points all day in the 2026 Rose Bowl for one of the biggest playoff blowouts ever.\n\nMORE: Where Indiana ranks among all-time losing CFB programs\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 31, Ohio State 0\n\nThere's only two shutouts on this list of CFP blowouts, and one came in 2016, when Clemson decimated Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl, which was a playoff semifinal game.\n\nUrban Meyer coached his unit to a 31-0 win, scoring in all four quarters while his defense didn't allow a single point to the Buckeyes. Despite Deshaun Watson's two interceptions, he also ran for two scores and threw for another.\n\nOhio State registered just nine first-downs all night, with quarterback J.T. Barrett throwing a pair of interceptions as Clemson moved onto the championship.\n\nMORE:The 7 biggest national championship upsets ever\n\nFinal Score: Ole Miss 41, Tulane 10\n\nTulane had a hard time keeping up with Ole Miss in the first round of the playoff in 2025, letting up two quick touchdown drives to start the game and only finding the end zone once in a 41-10 loss.\n\nThe Green Wave actually racked up more than 400 yards of offense, but they struggled to finish drives, turned the ball over three times and slipped up again defensively in the second half after a promising finish to the first half.\n\nOle Miss totaled 497 yards of offense in the win, including 346 passing yards with Trinidad Chambliss in full command.\n\nFinal Score: Penn State 38, SMU 10\n\nIn the first year of the 12-team CFP, Penn State earned the right to host a first-round game in Beaver Stadium, and the opposing environment did not go well for the SMU Mustangs. They were blown out, 38-10, as the Nittany Lions moved onto the quarterfinals.\n\nPenn State's first offensive score didn't come until the five-minute mark of the second quarter, but James Franklin's team was already up multiple scored by then — SMU quarterback Kevin Jennings threw two pick-sixes in the first half.\n\nThe Mustangs didn't find the end zone until the fourth quarter, and even on a day where quarterback Drew Allar had just 127 yards and no touchdowns, Penn State rolled to a CFP win.\n\nMORE: How Penn State's 'White Out' became an annual tradition\n\nFinal Score: Alabama 52, Ohio State 24\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide capped a perfect season with a huge win over Ohio State in the 2021 CFP championship, scoring 35 points in the first half alone to coast against the Buckeyes.\n\nAll night, the Crimson Tide offense was on fire — quarterback Mac Jones threw for 464 yards and five touchdown passes, running back Najee Harris scored three times, and Heisman Trophy winning-receiver Devonta Smith took his 12 catches for 215 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe Buckeyes were playing keep-up from the start, and Alabama won yet another national title under Nick Saban.\n\nMORE: Revisiting Alabama's loaded 2015 coaching staff\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 44, Alabama 16\n\nAlabama came into the 2019 title game as the No. 1-ranked team, but the final score said otherwise. The second-ranked Clemson Tigers had no issues en route to a 15-0 record and national title, winning by 28 points.\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a clean 347 passing yards and three touchdown passes, which went to Justyn Ross, Tee Higgins and Travis Etienne, who also scored twice on the ground. Dabo Swinney's squad used 17 second-quarter points to build its advantage.\n\nClemson won its second national title in three years with its blowout win.\n\nMORE: Where is Clemson located?\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 30, Notre Dame 3\n\nIn a CFP semifinal game, Clemson came in and routed Notre Dame in the 2018 Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Texas. The Tigers, who also went on to blow out Alabama in the championship game, walked away with a dominant 30-3 win over the Fighting Irish.\n\nClemson entered with a 13-0 record behind quarterback Trevor Lawrence, and even a suspension for three players, including starting defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, coming into the game didn't slow the Tigers down.\n\nOf Clemson's 30 points, 27 went unanswered from the first-quarter on. Lawrence threw touchdown passes to Justyn Ross (2) and Tee Higgins, then Travis Etienne put a cap on the win with a 62-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.\n\nMORE: Why are LSU and Clemson both called 'Death Valley'?\n\nFinal Score: Ohio State 42, Tennessee 17\n\nIn hindsight, the fact that Ohio State was the No. 9 seed in the 2024 College Football Playoff bracket looks laughable, but the eventual-champion Buckeyes faced significant questions coming onto the playoff after losing their regular-season finale to Michigan.\n\nHowever, Ryan Day's unit came out and dominated to open the CFP, cruising to a 21-0 start in the first quarter against Josh Huepel's Tennessee squad.\n\nThe Buckeyes advanced to the quarterfinals with a 42-17 win as quarterback Will Howard threw for 311 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, freshman phenom Jeremiah Smith caught two touchdown passes with 103 yards, and running backs TreVeyson Henderson and Quinshon Judkins both scored twice.\n\nMORE: The history of Ohio State coaches' records vs. Michigan\n\nFinal Score: Georgia 34, Michigan 11\n\nAt the 2021 Orange Bowl, Georgia met Michigan for one of the two CFP semifinal games. And on New Year's Eve, it was all Bulldogs.\n\nKirby Smart and Georgia, which would go on to beat Alabama in the title game, took down Jim Harbaugh's Wolverines by 23 points, getting out to a 27-3 lead by halftime and winning 34-11.\n\nStetson Bennett threw for 310 yards and three touchdowns in the win, throwing his scoring passes to Brock Bowers, James Cook and Jermaine Burton.\n\nMORE: Georgia's timeline of trouble under Kirby Smart\n\nHere's a look at the past CFP national title winners.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about College Football Playoff format",

    "fullText": "After a night of rain in Pasadena, the Indiana Hoosiers washed away the weight of history.\n\nEntering the Rose Bowl, College Football Playoff teams coming off first-round byes were winless. At the start of the season, the Hoosiers led college football with the most all-time losses. During their sole previous Rose Bowl appearance in 1968, the Hoosiers lost to USC.\n\nIndiana’s football program spent most of its time stuck in the Big Ten conference basement, but that era is over.\n\nNow, with new blood infused by head coach Curt Cignetti and an offense led by Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, the Hoosiers have turned the page and shattered expectations.\n\nAfter a quarter of brushing off their rust following a three-week break, No. 1 Indiana rolled to a 38-3 Rose Bowl victory over No. 9 Alabama Thursday afternoon in front of a crowd of 90,278. It is the largest postseason margin of defeat in Crimson Tide history.\n\n\"We've come through in clutch moments,\" Cignetti said during his ESPN postgame interview. \"I'm proud of the way they've responded.\"\n\nIndiana scored its first touchdown on a 21-yard pass from Mendoza to Charlie Becker to make it 10-0. It was the first touchdown scored by a Hoosier at the Rose Bowl in program history, the perfect way to establish Indiana’s domination.\n\nIndiana’s defense established its dominance during a pivotal stretch in the second quarter when Alabama could not afford to let the Hoosiers stretch their lead.\n\nFacing fourth-and-one at the Alabama 34, Indiana coach Curt Cignetti called timeout when it was clear the Tide were in a trick play formation. After the timeout, Alabama tried to get the Indiana defense to jump offsides but couldn’t get a penalty and burned a timeout of its own. The teams lined up one more time on fourth down, with Crimson Tide running back Daniel Hill passing to receiver Germie Bernard. Indiana’s Isaiah Jones and Rolijah Hardy combined to stuff Bernand for no gain and a game-defining turnover on downs.\n\nHoosiers fans celebrated the early success after taking over the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day. The sea of cherry red fans planted their flag and made themselves heard. Any time the word Alabama was mentioned, Indiana fans booed and asserted homefield advantage. With the skies clearing after a morning of heavy rain, Hoosiers joyously broke out “Who’s your daddy?” chants.\n\nCignetti kept taking jabs at the Tide defense with heavy use of the run game early in the contest. When it was his turn to pass, Mendoza was nearly perfect. He finished 14 of 16 passing for 192 yards and three touchdowns. He was sacked three times, but Mendoza never turned the ball over.\n\nMendoza contributed to the strong Indiana run game, frustrating the gashed Tide defense. With all his receivers covered, he scrambled for a back-breaking eight-yard run in the third quarter to tighten Indiana’s control of the game.\n\nThe following play, Mendoza threw a 24-yard touchdown to Elijah Sarrat to make it 24-0. He finished with 38 rushing yards.\n\nEntering the game, Indiana wanted to contain Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson. He gave up a critical first-half fumble and struggled to find seams in the Indiana defense. Tide coach Kalen DeBoer eventually benched Simpson, who had been limited by injuries part of this season, at halftime.\n\nCrimson Tide second-string quarterback Austin Mack finished the game with 103 passing yards. Simpson finished the game with 67. Mack threw a 34-yard pass to Bernard in the third quarter, which led to a 28-yard field goal that made the score 24-3.\n\nThe Hoosiers tacked on a Kaelon Black 25-yard rushing touchdown to make it 31-3. He finished the game with 99 yards and one touchdown.\n\nAs clouds dissipated, the Hoosiers booked their ticket to the Peach Bowl, where they will face Oregon in their pursuit of the ultimate team award – the national championship.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Quarterback Lamar Jackson shared his status for the Steelers-Ravens Week 18 game.",
    "fullText": "Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson will play in Week 18 against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a win-or-go-home game.\n\n\"I'm gonna be out there,\" Jackson said.\n\nThis poses a greater challenge for the Steelers' defense, as the two-time MVP is a dynamic quarterback.\n\nIn their first matchup, Pittsburgh did a good job of limiting Jackson, as he completed 19 of 35 passes for 219 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He also rushed for 43 yards and a touchdown on seven carries.\n\nThe Steelers will need another effective defensive performance against the Ravens. Pittsburgh needs to force Baltimore to pass the ball.\n\nIn that game, the Ravens had a strong rushing attack, as Derrick Henry ran for 94 yards on 25 carries and Keaton Mitchell added 76 yards on six carries.\n\nThe Steelers' defense limited Baltimore's passing attack, and that could be crucial if they can force Jackson into must-pass situations.\n\nHowever, a lot will hinge on the effectiveness of Pittsburgh's offense. The Steelers will be without star wide receiver DK Metcalf, who is serving the final game of his suspension.\n\nIn the first game against Pittsburgh, Metcalf had a monster game, hauling in seven receptions for 148 yards. On the season, Metcalf has 59 receptions for 850 yards and six touchdowns.\n\nPittsburgh will also be without another one of their top weapons in tight end Darnell Washington, as he suffered a broken arm. On the season, Washington had 31 receptions for 364 yards and a touchdown.\n\nWithout Metcalf and Washington, the Steelers will need wide receivers Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Adam Thielen to step up, as well as tight end Pat Freiermuth.\n\nThe Steelers' offense struggled in Week 17 against the Cleveland Browns, as they didn't have a reliable weapon for Aaron Rodgers to target.\n\nAgainst the Ravens, they will need to establish the run game with Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell to open up the passing attack. In their first game, the rushing attack was ineffective, as Warren rushed for 13 yards on eight carries and Gainwell had 15 yards and a touchdown on four carries.\n\nThe Steelers will have a tough battle against the Ravens in Week 18 for the AFC North title and a spot in the postseason, and it will be even more challenging with Jackson playing.",

From 2023 t0 2025, though, that number dropped to just an average of 70, 56 fewer underclassmen per class and a 44 percent overall drop in underclassmen declaring.\n\nWith direct payments from schools to players now allowed, plus the NFL still having a rookie wage scale, you could see even more kids elect to return to college football this season.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are looking at a Week 18 without much to play for.\n\nThey're also dealing with an injury to superstar quarterback Josh Allen.\n\nMore and more, it looks like Allen is going to sit.\n\nHe didn't practice Thursday for the second consecutive day because of his injured foot. It's shaping up for him to rest in Week 18 against the Jets in favor of backup QB Mitchell Trubisky.\n\nAlthough there's one problem with that: Allen has started 139 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NFL.\n\nMORE: Philip Rivers is retiring from the NFL, again\n\nThere's a loophole way for the Bills to approach this, though. All Allen has to do is play the first snap of the game to extend the streak.\n\nThat's what he did last season, taking the field for the opening snap before trotting off the field with a smile on his face.\n\nIt seems safe to expect Allen to do that again this year.\n\nThe Bills certainly need to prioritize Allen's health for the playoffs, and it appears that's what they're doing.\n\nIf they can extend his streak in a foolproof way in the process, all the better.\n\nDrake Maye has one issue that could stop Patriots from winning Super Bowl\n\nMicah Parsons' injury has crushed the Packers in a very specific way\n\nJalen Hurts has a big problem, and it's not what it used to be\n\nPuka Nacua made the best non-catch you've ever seen\n\nPope Leo XIV gives the Seahawks a good omen\n\nThis viral Josh Allen highlight from Wyoming is crazy",

    "fullText": "South Carolina WR Vandrevius Jacobs plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, per On3’s Pete Nakos. Jacobs was the Gamecocks second-leading receiver in 2025.\n\nHis 32 receptions led South Carolina receivers this season, and totaled 548 yards and four touchdowns as a result. On his career, Jacobs has caught 47 passes for 789 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nJacobs had three 100+ yard performances during the 2025 season. This included matchups vs. Missouri (128 yards, TD), Kentucky (108 yards) and Clemson (141 yards, TD). His performance against Clemson was a career best.\n\nBefore college, Jacobs was a four-star recruit in the 2024 recruiting class per the Rivals Industry Rankings, which is a proprietary algorithm that compiles ratings and rankings from all four primary recruiting media services. He was the No. 338 overall recruit and No. 52 overall player at his position.\n\nHis decision comes after South Carolina’s No. 1 WR in 2025, Nyck Harbor, announced that he’ll be returning to Columbia in 2026.\n\n“You really thought I was going somewhere? Nah,” Harbor said in a video he posted on social media. “Eight’s running it back. Let’s do it.”\n\nAdditionally, QB LaNorris Sellers announced his plan to return to South Carolina next season. The two will provide what’ll be expected to be one of the most exciting duos in the SEC in 2026. Many placed high expectations on Sellers ahead of the 2025 season and while that didn’t pan out the way many believed the would, Sellers will use the 2026 to regain that type ahead of his redshirt junior season.\n\nSouth Carolina finished the season with a 4-8 record, missing out on a bowl game for the second time in three seasons under head coach Shane Beamer. This comes after the Gamecocks broke out for nine wins in 2024. Their strong finish to the year led to South Carolina ranked 13th in the preseason AP Poll and were ranked as high as No. 10 before losing six of their last seven games.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

    "fullText": "On Thursday afternoon, the Alabama Crimson Tide were back in action to play in a must-win game, doing so against the Indiana Hoosiers in the CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl.\n\nWith a trip to the CFP semifinal at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on the line, it was Indiana who secured a victory out in Pasadena, defeating Alabama in blowout fashion, 38-3.\n\nSimply put, this was one of the worst bowl performances in recent memory for the Crimson Tide, one that included a 407-193 total yardage deficit for Alabama against the No. 1 overall seeded Hoosiers.\n\nFollowing are some instant reactions to Alabama's loss against Indiana in the CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl.\n\nOne of the biggest stories from Alabama's loss to Indiana was the performance of the Crimson Tide on both sides of the ball on third down. Offensively, Alabama was held to 3-of-11 on third downs, as well as 0-2 on fourth, while the Crimson Tide defense also struggled, allowing Indiana to convert 9-of-14 attempts.\n\nSimilar to the first round against Oklahoma, Alabama fell behind early on by a sizable margin, but this was a first half deficit the Crimson Tide could not overcome. Alabama turned the ball over on downs, as well as fumbled the ball, in the first half, both of which led to Indiana touchdowns to help build a 17-0 edge at halftime.\n\nWhile the Crimson Tide posted three sacks, Indiana's Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza had a big day against the Alabama defense. In all, Mendoza completed 14-of-16 passes for 192 yards and three scores, while also rushing for 16 yards on eight attempts.\n\nAlabama made a quarterback change in the third quarter following an injury to Ty Simpson, with Austin Mack playing a majority of the second half. Mack ended up completing 11-of-16 passes for 103 yards during the second half.\n\nAs a result of the Crimson Tide's loss in the Rose Bowl, Alabama's season comes to an end in the CFP quarterfinal round with an 11-4 overall record. Indiana will advance to face No. 5 seeded Oregon in the CFP semifinals.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama football instant reactions to Rose Bowl loss vs. Indiana",

    "fullText": "How bad was Alabama’s 38-3 loss to Indiana? History shows a stunning low point for the Tide originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlabama’s 38-3 loss to Indiana in the Rose Bowl wasn’t just a defeat, but a historical anomaly that highlighted how far the Crimson Tide fell on college football’s biggest stage.\n\nThe setback marked the worst margin of defeat for the Alabama Crimson Tide in more than two decades. No Alabama team in the past 20 seasons had lost by 30 points, a reflection of the standard established during Nick Saban’s tenure. For first-year coach Kalen DeBoer, it was the most one-sided loss of his time in Tuscaloosa and the program’s worst showing since a 42-6 defeat to Arkansas on Sept. 26, 1998.\n\nBeing held to three points placed Alabama in rare and uncomfortable territory. The Tide had not failed to score a touchdown since the 9-6 overtime loss to LSU in the 2011 “Game of the Century.” More recently, a 24-3 loss at Oklahoma in 2024 ended a long touchdown streak, but the Rose Bowl result went even further. The 35-point margin surpassed the 44-16 loss to Clemson in the 2018 national championship game as the program’s most jarring modern-era defeat.\n\nIndiana left no doubt it belonged. Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza delivered one of the most efficient post-Heisman performances in recent memory, completing 14 of 16 passes for 192 yards and three touchdowns as the Hoosiers controlled the game from start to finish.\n\nThe outcome also intensified scrutiny on DeBoer after a week spent deflecting rumors about the Michigan opening. He now heads into the offseason facing questions about Alabama’s direction.\n\nFor Curt Cignetti and the Indiana Hoosiers, the night was historic.

    "fullText": "While many of the headlines lately seem to be about players making the decisions to explore their options in the transfer portal, Penn State and new head coach Matt Campbell got a bit of big news from one of the top defensive players on the roster. Linebacker Tony Rojas announced he will be staying in Happy Valley in 2026.\n\nRojas shared his announcement to return wiht a post on his Instagram account on Thursday, putting an end to any speculation that he may explore some transfer opportunities this offseason.\n\n\"The past three seasons have been an incredible ride with a lot of historic moments and lifetime memories I will be able to hold on to,\" Rojas said in his statement. \"But as we all know, this season has been nothing but a roller coaster and I was in disbelief and hurt when I went down. I felt like I let myself down and most importantly my teammates down.\n\n\"With that being said, after lots of talks with my family and close ones, I will be returning to Penn State for my senior year,\" Rojas confirmed. \"I'm ready to finish what me and my teammates started and am ready to flip this thing and tell an incredible story with Coach Campbell and his new staff.\"\n\nRojas was one of the rising stars on the defense since his arrival with the program but he suffered what turned out to be a season-ending injury during the 2025 season. His loss from the roster fell in line with the rapid decline of Penn State's season with UCLA being the first team to take full advantage of a Rojas-less Penn State defense. Penn State went on to lose the next four games after that UCLA loss (Northwestern, Iowa, Ohio State, and Indiana) as the defense worked to fix some concerns it had.\n\nPenn State does have a few linebackers choosing to enter the transfer portal, likely resulting in their pending departure from the program. Karui Jackson, Keon Wylie, and Anthony Speca have all reportedly entered the transfer portal.\n\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Penn State LB Tony Rojas announces decision for 2026",

    "description": "A deeper look with @iamcogs at Caleb Williams’ and the Chicago Bears’ 38-42 loss against the San Francisco 49ers",
    "fullText": "Note: Due to unforeseen New Years plans, play reviews won’t be done this week. I will be doing a deep dive into play reviews next week to make up for the lack of them the last two weeks!\n\nFirst and foremost: Happy New Years to all of you Windy City Gridiron faithful! I hope 2026 brings you all the happiness and blessings you deserve!\n\nI don’t think any Bears loss has made me feel as inspired as the loss we had on Sunday Night Football against the San Francisco 49ers last week.\n\nThat’s a weird thing to say, thinking about it, but bear with me.\n\nThere have been many Bears games in the past where our defense just wasn’t on it’s A game, and the opposing teams’ offense boat races us. Take for example the 2014 Chicago Bears. After suffering a crushing 51-23 loss to the Tom Brady led New England Patriots, the Bears, coming out of a bye week, gave up an astounding 55 to rival Green Bay, a game in which the Packers went into halftime with a 42-0 lead.\n\nWhile this is an example taken from perhaps the worst Bears defense ever fielded, there’s some parallels. We were a respectable to good offense during the Trestman era, (perhaps more so in 2013) the Bears defense struggled to stop teams from scoring, and in my cases that offense could not keep up.\n\nOn Sunday night that wasn’t the case.\n\nEach time the 49ers swung, we swung back, even taking a late lead with a 29-yard Cairo Santos field goal. It came down to the final play, but the Bears would fall short to the 49ers 38-42, on a disjointed play due in part to the play call coming in late.\n\nThe Bears offense went blow for blow, on the road, in a playoff atmosphere, against a premiere NFC opponent, and it came down to the last play. And a lot of that is due in part to Bears quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nWilliams shined on primetime, completing 25 of 42 passes for 330 yards, 2 touchdowns and a 100.3 Passer Rating (125.7 TPR). He was absolute money when his team was behind all night, and he connected on deep balls over and over again, hitting on all 4 of his deep attempts for 130 yards, 2 touchdown and a perfect 158.3 Passer Rating (for a little fun, that’s a 608.8 on the TPR model!)\n\nAnd this isn’t just a one off thing, if you’ve been following the series you know he’s been steadily playing his best football of his career, in fact his numbers over the last 10 weeks are stellar, and some of his season long numbers have been incredible too.\n\nOver those last 10 weeks:\n71.0% On-Target%\n(LOS: 89.8% | S: 76.1% | M: 58.0% | D: 59.0%)\n2,655 Tot Yards (265.5/game)\n16 Tot TD (3.7% TD%)\n4 Tot Turnovers (0.9% Turnover%)\n12 Sacks (3.3% Sack%)\n9.3 ADOT\n21 Dropped Passes\n8.6% Big Play % | 1.6% Turnover Worthy %\n\nLocked in. https://t.co/gdKGQelzoN\n\n— Grim Cutty (@iamcogs) December 31, 2025\n\nA big play quarterback, with elite level sack avoidance and mobility, who also refuses to turn the ball over is a rare blend of quarterback that us Bears fans have never seen under center.\n\nSo often when it came to prime time I always had extreme levels of Bears related anxiety when it comes to how our quarterback plays. But in 5 prime time games this season, Williams completed 99/176 passes for 1,196 yards, 7 touchdowns and just 1 interception.\n\nI’m so excited to say this, but I’m ready to: We’ve found a franchise quarterback, and it’s going to be a very fun decade of Bears football.\n\n(Totals and averages are all before week 17: Season totals are underlined, Season averages in Italics)\n\nC/A: 285/493 (57.8%) | 19/32.9 (57.8%) | 25/42 (59.5%)\n\nQB at Fault Sacks: 13 | 0.9 | 0\n\nTrue Passer Rating: 126.0 | 125.7\n\nTime to Pressure: 2.64s | 3.11s\n\nPoor Play Rate / Big Play Rate: 9.6% PPR / 7.7% BPR | 2.1% PPR / 10.4% BRP\n\nThe full grading sheet for each play can be found here.\n\nNFL Passer Rating / True Passer Rating / PFF Grade: 100.3 / 125.7 / 71.8\n\nThe average passer rating in the 2025 season sits at 92.3 through week 17. His 100.3 NFL Passer Rating would be considered a good game.\n\nA 125.7 TPR is a solid Good game boarding on great, with 100 serving as the baseline for “Average.”\n\nOn the PFF scale, a score of 70 or higher is considered an Above Average game. With a 71.8, Caleb Williams’ performance was graded as a lower end Above Average game.\n\nPFF’s score is honestly underselling his performance this week, in my opinion. I pointed it out in a tweet earlier this week where Bo Nix was graded higher on the week than Williams, despite a much less impressive performance.\n\nOn-Target Throws: Season Average: 66.2% | Week 17 vs. 49ers: 76.5%\n\nReminder: Completion % ≠ On-Target %. On-target throws are only counted on aimed passes, so throw aways, spikes, and deflections at the line aren’t counted. And drops are counted as on-target.\n\nShort-Level Passing (Behind LOS – 9 yards): 21/26 | 80.8% On-Target\n\nDeep-Level Passing (10–20+ yards): 5/8 | 62.5% On-Target\n\nHis On-Target throwing has improved leaps and bounds. In the first 6 weeks of the season he was sitting at just 59.1%, but over the last 10 weeks his On-Target % is at 71.0%, with each and every one of those 10 games being above his season average On-Target rate. Very obvious and quantifiable growth!\n\n2.1% Poor Play Rate (turnover-worthy + poorly graded plays) against a 10.4% Big Play Rate (great + elite graded plays)\n\nI keep repeating myself here, but this is another week of positive trending when it comes to being under his season mark of PPR and being over his season mark on BPR.\n\nHow about that free play touchdown to Colston Loveland? It’s intangibles like that, that make me excited over the future of this kid.\n\nOver the last 3 weeks his big play rate has exploded, sitting at 8.6%, which is nearly double his season mark of 4.8%.\n\nTime to Throw: We saw a good mix of play-action and pocket passing this week, once again, putting his time to throw charted by me at 2.95 seconds.\n\nPer PFF his time to throw out of play-action last week was 3.75 seconds\n\nNo play-action time to throw sat at 3.03 seconds.\n\nIceman Cometh: The Bears spent a good portion of the game trailing, but Caleb Williams didn’t miss a beat, throwing for 257-yards, 2 touchdowns, and an adjusted 75.0% completion %. Just more proof that when the game is in peril, QB1 delivers.\n\nHis final scores in week 17 of 1st Half (1.05) / 2nd Half (3.95) / Game (5.00) give him another solid “Good” game grade on the season. His 4th game of the season with a “Good” or better grade, he also only has 3 games all season that graded below the score of “Average” (Week 1 vs. MIN, Week 6 @ WAS, Week 12 vs. PIT.) Of the 7 quarterbacks I grade, only Drake Maye has had more Good or better games (7).\n\nOf the seven quarterbacks I grade (with the slight caveat of 3 of those quarterbacks are injured) Williams placed 1st this week, as he continues an extremely impressive back-end performance to the 2025 season.\n\nWeekly scores of every QB I grade can be found here.\n\nThe Bears come back home for the final week of a the 2025 NFL regular season. Crazy to think this season has flown by as fast as it has. The Bears have a few things on the line, a win would lock up the #2 seed in the playoff’s ensuring 2 playoff home games (if they handle business in the wildcard round.) Caleb Williams is also 109 yards away from breaking the Chicago Bears single season passing yardage record held by Erik Kramer, and is 270 yards away from being the franchises first 4,000 yard passer. I predict that he will, in fact, do just that against the Lions at home.\n\nAs always, Bear Down, and we will see you back here next week!\n\nGary Baugher Jr. is a rookie contributor to WCG, bringing football insight backed by over 16 years of experience in organized football and more than 30 years as a passionate fan of the game.

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — No. 1 Indiana became the first team in the brief history of the 12-team College Football Playoff to win a game after receiving a first-round bye, smothering Alabama 38-3 in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Hoosiers (14-0; No. 1 AP, No. 1 CFP) ended a six-game losing streak for teams coming off an extended layoff, including second seed Ohio State falling to Miami in the Cotton Bowl on Wednesday and fourth seed Texas Tech being shutout by Oregon in the Orange Bowl earlier on Thursday.\n\nAn inauspicious start made it seem as if Indiana might continue the trend of teams unable to respond after a long layoff, going three-and-out on the opening possession with Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza taking two sacks. The Crimson Tide (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) then found early success with two quick first downs into Hoosiers’ territory before the defense stepped up to force a punt.\n\nFrom there, Indiana came to life, taking a 17-0 halftime lead on a 31-yard field goal by Nicolas Radicic and two touchdown passes from Mendoza. Avoiding an early deficit was crucial, as it had been something of a constant in the previous losses by idle teams.\n\nThe Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-0 hole at the break against the Hurricanes, and the Red Raiders allowed 104 yards to the Ducks while gaining minus-2 yards in the first quarter. In last year's Granddaddy of Them All, Oregon gave up the first 34 points in a 41-21 loss to eventual national champion Ohio State.\n\nNot spotting Alabama an early advantage allowed Indiana to continue playing to its strengths and eventually wear down the SEC at-large participant.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "As long as the performances on the pitch are positive, the FC Bayern brand might be bulletproof.",
    "fullText": "When a club as big as Bayern Munich does anything, it’s bound to gather attention from the media. Now imagine when the German side do something significantly positive or, even worse, negative. Disaster. Any and every shortcoming Bayern endure is put under the microscope for the unforgiving media to scrutinize.\n\nTake Bayern’s failed attempt to sign Florian Wirtz. The failed transfer signaled a media rampage, ultimately writing Bayern off as a desirable destination for top players without a single minute of the 2025/26 season being played. One signing of Luis Díaz and a few months later, Bayern are the talk of the town across Europe, perhaps even the favorite to win the Champions League. From one end of the pendulum to the other. That’s how quickly things change at Bayern.\n\nOne thing that remains consistent no matter what, is the media. However positive or negative, the white noise doesn’t seem to bother Bayern sporting director, Christoph Freund.\n\n“There’s always a lot going on around FC Bayern,” explained Freund in an interview with Servus Nachrichten (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “So much is being written and so many rumors. The club is just so big and interesting. If a transfer somehow doesn’t work out, then it’s obviously a huge topic. But we’ve always said that we don’t have to do much with our squad. When our injured players come back, we’ll have a really good team. The club hasn’t lost any of its appeal. When something is reported, whether positive or negative, it’s always about FC Bayern Munich. That’s a brand, and it’s a huge one.”\n\nAfter decades of being at the very pinnacle of Europe’s elite, Die Rekordmeister are primed to deal with the media. While headlines and criticism may trigger fans, it’s just another day in the office for Bayern.",

He started his career at West Virginia and redshirted his first year in the sport. Trotter was a freshman All-American for the Mountaineers in 2024 before transferring to Mizzou.\n\nInstead, he’ll go through the draft process, and all indications suggest he will be a top-100 prospect this year.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Mizzou learned that fellow third-year and potential NFL Draft entrant Cayden Green will not declare for the draft and instead will return to Columbia in 2026.\n\nAll Glory to God pic.twitter.com/LB5N0p9DEv\n\n— Josiah Trotter (@TrotterJosiah) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Tigers are now waiting on a decision from one final third-year player: defensive end Damon Wilson II, who can stay or declare for the draft.\n\nTrotter was Mizzou’s leading tackler in his lone season in Columbia, racking up 84 total tackles, which included 13 hits behind the line of scrimmage and two sacks.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Trotter as the third-best run-stopping linebacker in the Southeastern Conference and as a top-five pass-rushing LB in the league.\n\nHe has significant professional pedigree in his family.\n\nHis father, Jeremiah Trotter Sr., was a four-time Pro Bowler and Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer who spent more than a decade in the league.\n\nJosiah Trotter’s older brother, Jeremiah Trotter Jr., was on the Eagles roster than won the Super Bowl last season.\n\nMock Draft Database has Trotter listed at No. 107 on its consensus big board for the 2026 draft, which is a fourth-round slot. It would not be a surprise to see the 6-foot-2, 237-pound linebacker climb higher as he goes through the NFL Scouting Combine and Pro Day.\n\nIt’s a significant loss for Mizzou’s defense.\n\nThe Tigers announced earlier Thursday that standout sophomore Nicholas Rodriguez will return in 2026. But, Mizzou is also set to lose two more players from its core, four-player rotation in Khalil Jacobs and Triston Newson to eligibility.\n\nThat means Missouri likely will be active in the transfer portal looking to fill those gaps.\n\nMore: Missouri football needs a QB for 2026.

    "fullText": "The term 'Stetson Bennett-esque' has been used to describe Gunner Stockton from time to time throughout his time as Georgia's starting quarterback.\n\nStockton himself told me ahead of the 2025 season that he sees a lot of who he is in Stetson Bennett. And it just so turns out that the the feeling is mutual.\n\nThe legendary former Georgia quarterback was highly complementary of Stockton and said he saw a lot of similarities in their journeys.\n\n\"I'd love to hear what he said about me,\" Bennett laughed to me following the Rams' 27-24 loss to the Falcons on Monday night. \"In terms of you saying he told you he thinks he has the same type of playing style and moxie as me, I totally agree. I love watching him and I'm one of the biggest fans of Georgia that there is.\"\n\nBennett lives and breathes Georgia. That much rang true in his decision to come to Georgia as a walk-on for a second time after going to Jones College, taking a chance against some of the toughest quarterback competition in the nation against then-Bobcats head coach Steve Buckley.\n\nThe rest is history as Bennett became perhaps the best college football player story of all-time. The quarterback still has the same sentiment toward Georgia, even if he's not able to watch the Bulldogs as much as he would like to at this point in his personal NFL journey.\n\n\"Saturdays are our traveling days, so I haven't gotten to watch as much of Georgia as I used to,\" Bennett said. \"But the little bit I've watched, I loved.\"\n\nBennett sees Georgia as the same gritty team he came from, with a story that echoes his own experience with the Bulldogs in some ways. Stockton has been a part of that, with Bennett saying the Tiger, Georgia native is among his favorite players to watch.\n\n\"They've gotten better as time has gone on and early in the season,\" Bennett said. \"They got battle tested but you see moments like that 4th & 6 pass Gunner threw against Tennessee. The scratching and fighting and clawing and figuring out a way to get it done when they had to.\"\n\nBennett will have his eyes closely locked on the Sugar Bowl matchup between Georgia and Ole Miss on Thursday evening. He couldn't be more confident in a quarterback who has been pinned by some as the next \"Stetson Bennett\" already.\n\n\"Just trying to go out there and do the best that you can for your team. It looks like Gunner has been doing that all year, and I can't wait to watch him continue doing that.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Draft Wire: Stetson Bennett 'totally agrees' with Gunner Stockton comparison",

    "title": "Notable quotes from Dan Lanning's presser after shutout vs. Texas Tech",
    "description": "Oregon Ducks head coach Dan Lanning met with media members to break down his team's win over the Texas Tech Red Raiders in the CFP Quarterfinals.",
    "fullText": "It may have taken an entire calendar year, but the Oregon Ducks finally exorcised their demons from last year with a win in the College Football Playoff Quarterfinals. They manhandled the Texas Tech Red Raiders in a 23-0 shutout, where the Big-12 champions’ top-10 offense was dismantled.\n\nDan Lanning was visibly frustrated with his team’s defense after their win in the first round of the playoffs, so it makes sense why the unit put together such an inspired performance. The same couldn’t be said for the offense, who only had 16 points total before a garbage-time touchdown inflated the stats slightly.\n\nWhile there are still things to improve upon, it should make the Ducks feel good that they can be so dominant while playing far below their potential. They are just two wins away from being immortalized as champions. Let’s look at what Lanning had to say about that prospect and the win today over Texas Tech.\n\nLanning: Unbelievable game. A lot of fun. We've talked to our guys about being battle tested all year and having to win in different ways. That game went back and forth in a lot of ways, struggled at times to go score points, and our defense did an unbelievable job getting the ball back. And then our offense showed up when it mattered most at the end of the game. I think we out-physicaled our opponent at the end. A lot of respect for Coach McGuire and the team that he's had. This shouldn't discredit them. I remember this feeling last year when you have a really good team, you play really good football all year, and then it comes to an end. And that's the way it is for every team but one. Certainly grateful for our fans and excited to see them show up in Atlanta.\n\nQ: What did you make of the hype surrounding Texas Tech’s defense before this game?\n\nLanning: Yeah, we thought they were. They are a good defense. Their performance today, I think it showed it. You walk into halftime, it's 6-0, that's a great indicator of them being a good defense. And they had some guys that played some really good ball. We just felt like in this moment it was going to be about chipping away and eventually it was going to break. It kind of broke open with us creating some extra opportunities there with takeaways, opportunities on special teams. I thought our special teams played really, really well.\n\nBut we had a lot of respect for Texas Tech's defense. They don't play the way they've played all year and not be good. And they are. They're good. We thought it would be about explosive plays. There weren't a ton of explosive plays in this game really for either side. But the physicality showed up for our guys down the stretch.\n\nQ: How were you able to shut down the Red Raiders’ passing attack?\n\nLanning: Definitely it starts with players like Brandon. I think Brandon would tell you the same thing. It's about 11 guys executing, and that's how you get an opportunity to create plays like that. I think when we pull up this film and we watch it, we're going to see 11 guys playing the same call. We knew their tempo would be an issue. So ultimately we wanted to be able to get the call in fast and let our guys line up. I thought we did a really good job of that.\n\nI thought Coach Lupoi did a great job of calling the game, and our defensive coaches preparing them. I felt like it was probably faster in practice than it was in the game, which is ultimately what we wanted. And then we knew their strengths. They've been really good at completing shots down the field. They've had a really good screen game. Those are things that we really prepared for and worked really hard for, and guys like Brandon showed up.\n\nQ: Can you speak about your mindset on going for it in fourth down?\n\nLanning: Well, it worked sometimes and didn't work sometimes. So I assume all the times it didn't work I'm stupid and all the times it worked I'm smart. That's kind of how it works. I feel like -- we talked about it at halftime. We made some adjustments. They were playing really good 4th down defense, and we decided, hey, let's take the points in the second half. But I think that's our mindset. We make those decisions early in the week, and I certainly trust our offense. They ran a really tough defensive call for what we called down there in the red area. That's one that you wish you had back, say we could have took the points there. But points are never guaranteed. We missed a field goal, too.\n\nBut I felt good about -- we had an early look on punt and felt like we were going to have a look at the punt fake. That was an opportunity to go be aggressive. And just felt like ultimately, if you limit the opportunities for their offense to be on the field, you were going to increase the opportunities for us to go score and them not to, and that showed up today.\n\nQ: What is the challenges of defending a player like David Bailey?\n\nLanning: They've got good players, man. They've got really good players. They've got a great front. Ultimately they rushed the passer really, really well. I'm excited to evaluate the film and say how can we shore that up. I think there's going to be some small things that we can attack and make better. There's some plays we were really efficient at today, and then there were some plays that weren't. When you have a player like David Bailey, when you have players that you're going to see in the College Football Playoff, you've got to have a plan for them. At times our plan was really good, and then there was some times that we could certainly improve that.\n\nQ: Can you speak about Brandon Finney Jr.’s interception in the end zone?\n\nLanning: It's a strategic play. He did it exactly like we asked him to do. We tell him to play low to high down in the red area. He did exactly that. He played low until the player was able to show up and take away the low and then he creeped to high, and he made an outstanding play. I was just as impressed with the fact took a knee after he caught it.\n\nQ: What are your thoughts on not having a first-round bye?\n\nLanning: I guess it works, right? I've been a proponent for games to be happening much quicker for a long time. I think that's best for college football. Again, I felt like this game -- the Orange Bowl, first off, was unbelievable. I should have really given kudos to the Orange Bowl because it's been a great experience, but it's not the same bowl experience anymore when you talk about playoffs. Our guys didn't leave the hotel. They had a mindset that we can celebrate when this thing is all over with and they were really focused, but the hospitality here was unbelievable.\n\nBut we're trying to serve two different purposes here, and this is a playoff. A playoff in my opinion should have been played in Lubbock, Texas. I've said that before. That's not because we wanted to go play in Lubbock; I certainly didn't. I'm glad we played here in Miami, and it was good prep for us, but last year very similar situation for us. I feel like that game should have been played in Eugene. There's a lot of people that do playoffs. I feel like the playoffs have looked a certain way for a long time, and we're trying to serve two purposes here. The amount of time in between games, obviously, is tough for teams. We experienced it last year.\n\nQ: What will the next 24 hours look like for your team after this win?\n\nLanning: Well, it's going to start with about a five-hour flight, five-and-a-half-hour flight, but we'll be watching film on the way back, start trying to evaluate the opponents that we could potentially play. Hopefully we get some wi-fi up there in the air and we can flip on a game and check it out. But it always starts with us. That's where we're going to go back and look at this game and say, okay, what did we do really well. Let's go to the doctor, let's figure out what kind of medicine we've got to take for the next game because I think that's always the greatest indicator of what you have to improve, when you start to analyze what you have in front of you. Then we'll have kind of a bonus day here tomorrow and then we'll hop right into a normal week prep, Sunday prep. I don't even know what day today is. Today is Saturday in my mind. But we'll get a bonus day, and then it'll be Sunday the next day.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Top quotes from Dan Lanning after CFP win vs. Texas Tech Red Raiders",

    "fullText": "What's next for Alabama? Explaining questions surrounding Kalen DeBoer, Ty Simpson and more in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlabama's 2025 season came to an anticlimactic end on Thursday afternoon. The Tide fell 38-3 to the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers, in one of the worst playoff appearances for Alabama in recent years.\n\nAlthough the Tide managed to beat Oklahoma in the first round, losing by 28 points in the quarterfinal puts a sour end to the year. The three points Alabama put up is the lowest output since in its six appearances in the CFP era.\n\nNow that the book is closed on Alabama's 2025-26 season, let's take a look at what's next for head coach Kalen Deboer, quarterback Ty Simpson and the rest of the Tide in 2026.\n\nMORE:Lowest scoring Alabama games in CFP history\n\nThat likely depends on what incumbent Ty Simpson decides to do. The signal-caller's season was cut short against Indiana in the Rose Bowl. After taking a big hit that forced a fumble late in the second quarter, Tide head coach Kalen DeBoer benched him.\n\nThe decision appeared to be at least partly medical, as early in the second half, ESPN sideline reporter Kris Budden reported that while Simpson was trying to warm up, coaches determined he was not healthy enough to return to the game.\n\nSimpson is a redshirt junior who backed up both Bryce Young and Jalen Milroe in Tuscaloosa. He is eligible for the 2026 NFL Draft and could declare. The NFL Mock Draft database projects Simpson as a first-round pick, going No. 20 overall to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nSimpson, who threw for 3,500 yards with 28 touchdowns and five interceptions this season, had a strong first year as a starter. You could make the case for him to go pro, but you also can’t blame him for returning to Tuscaloosa to get another full season under his belt and possibly improve his draft stock, which dipped due to his late-season struggles.\n\nIf Simpson does leave, the Tide have a few options at quarterback. His backup is Austin Mack, who initially played under DeBoer at Washington. The former 4-star quarterback prospect out of Folsom, Calif., originally signed with the Huskies' 2023 class before following DeBoer to Tuscaloosa. After Simpson’s injury, Mack had a modest debut, going 11-of-16 for 103 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.\n\nAlabama also has former 5-star quarterback Keelon Russell from its 2025 class, and the Tide signed 4-star quarterback Jeff Thomalia to its 2026 recruiting class.\n\nMORE:Why Alabama QB Ty Simpson was pulled from Rose Bowl\n\nAs of now, it appears that Williams will remain with the Tide. In the days leading up to the Rose Bowl, he told  AL.com that he's \"Alabama through and through.\" He added that he has \"no intentions of being anywhere else.\"\n\n\"I had a lot of ups, people considered last year, and just learning how to deal with those, and I've had a lot of downs, people considered this year, and I've learned how to deal with those,\" Williams told ESPN at media day before the Rose Bowl. \"Really just an opportunity to stay human and have empathy for others, because I've been through some things. It's been a blessing to go through all the ups, all the downs, all the arounds.\"\n\nWilliams being speculated to transfer isn't too much of a surprise. He had a breakout season as a true freshman in 2024, getting 48 receptions 865 yards with eight touchdowns last season. But in 2025, Williams finished with just 43 receptions for 643 yards and four touchdowns. The sophomore is second nationally in highest percentage of drops (14.3) with 10 on the season.\n\nMORE:Indiana, Curt Cignetti shred rest vs. rust narrative in Rose Bowl\n\nKalen DeBoer is in his second season with Alabama, compiling a 20-8 record with the Tide over two seasons.\n\nDespite the impressive record and a playoff appearance this season, it hasn't all been sunshine and roses with the head coach and Alabama fans from the jump. In fact, it's been a roller coaster. DeBoer appeared to be on the hot seat after Alabama’s 2024 finish, which came in just his first season at the helm. The Tide seemed on track for a College Football Playoff bid last season, with one-score losses to Vanderbilt and Tennessee entering late November.\n\nThat changed with an embarrassing 24-3 road loss to Oklahoma on Nov. 23, which knocked Alabama out of playoff contention. The Tide then fell 19-13 to Michigan in the ReliaQuest Bowl to finish 9-4. Alabama opened the 2025 season with a 31-17 Week 1 road loss to Florida State.\n\nDeBoer worked his way back into fans’ good graces as the season progressed. Alabama beat then-No. 5 Georgia 24-21 on the road Sept. 27, then added wins over ranked Vanderbilt, Missouri and Tennessee. The Tide later lost 23-21 on the road to Oklahoma but rebounded with a win over Auburn to clinch a spot in the SEC championship game.\n\nAgainst Georgia in Atlanta, Alabama turned in an abysmal performance. In the 28-7 loss, the Tide were held to minus-3 rushing yards and just 209 yards of total offense, finishing 3-for-14 on third down. The showing was so poor that many expected Alabama to be left out of the CFP.\n\nInstead, the committee awarded Alabama a bid, and the Tide went on the road to face Oklahoma. Despite falling behind 17-0 early, they stormed back to win 34-24, briefly restoring DeBoer in Alabama fans' good graces. However, the 38-3 Rose Bowl loss quickly erased that goodwill. If Alabama gets off to a slow start in 2026, DeBoer will likely be under intense scrutiny again.\n\nTide fans’ fickle opinions are a big reason DeBoer was linked to the open Penn State and Michigan jobs. Expect his name to surface again in the 2026 coaching carousel if things remain unsteady in Tuscaloosa. With Thursday's loss, DeBoer's Alabama teams have dropped to 0-7 when trailing at halftime.\n\nHere's a look at Alabama's schedule for 2026:\n\nMORE:Worst Alabama losses: Where Rose Bowl defeat vs. Indiana ranks",

    "fullText": "Jordan Mailata's story with the Eagles isn't quite rags to riches. Still, the All-Pro left tackle has improved drastically year by year since Philadelphia selected the former Australian Rugby Player in the late rounds of the 2018 NFL draft. Since then, Mailata, 28, has developed into one of the NFL's most efficient and highest graded left tackles.\n\nMailata, like Jason Kelce before him, has taken on a mentor role in the Eagles' locker room, and like the former All-Pro center, Mailata will play a role in finding his eventual successor. While speaking with NJ Advance Media's Cayden Steele, Mailata hinted at an early retirement, but only after he finds his replacement.\n\n“I care a lot, man,” Mailata said. “I care a lot because I only have so long to play this game, man. Everyone’s like, ‘Oh, you can play another five years.’ Yeah, bulls---. I’m already in the phase of bringing the next guy along with me. Who’s it gonna be? I can’t tell you, but it’s a high standard playing in this city, so just gotta keep that going. And for me it’s just, I want the best for those boys. I am always going to root for the underdog.”\n\n“In a sense, I’d feel a type of way,” Mailata said about not finding his replacement before retirement. “You just want to leave it in a good place. Leave it as you found it.”\n\nWith the help of Lane Johnson and offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, Mailata has become the face of the NFL's International Pathway Program. Mailata's 83.8 overall grade from PFF is the 8th best in the NFL, while his 81.2 pass blocking grade is eighth as well.\n\nMailata has allowed two sacks in 972 pass block snaps.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Jordan Mailata has started to scout his likely successor with Eagles",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox are reportedly looking to add another bat and could pursue one of the top hitters.\n\nBoston has continued to show interest in bringing back Alex Bregman, but the team has also shown interest in Bo Bichette. Now, MLB.com’s analyst Jared Greenspan and Theo DeRosa linked the Red Sox to Eugenio Suarez if the team can’t land either Bregman or Bichette.\n\n“Boston could still use another impact bat,” the two wrote in an article published on Thursday. “Among the top remaining free-agent hitters, shortstop Bo Bichette and outfielders Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger aren’t the most natural fits for the Red Sox.\n\n“But re-signing third baseman Alex Bregman would be an obvious move. If Bregman signs elsewhere, slugger Eugenio Suarez could be a fallback option.”\n\nSuarez would be an impact bat for Boston and could play third base and hit in the middle of the order. The slugger split last season between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Seattle Mariners, and he hit 49 home runs with 118 RBIs. The 49 home runs tied his career-high back in 2019.\n\nThe Red Sox have also been linked to Ketel Marte in trade talks, but it’s uncertain if the Diamondbacks will move him.\n\nRegardless of who it ends up being, adding a bat is likely the priority for the Red Sox after shoring up their pitching staff this offseason.\n\nSo far this offseason, Boston has acquired first baseman Willson Contreras and pitchers Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo in three separate trades.\n\nRed Sox Fans Shouldn’t Forget About These Two Vital Extensions",

    "description": "Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes, Indiana’s defense thoroughly throttled Alabama, and the top-seeded Hoosiers roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 38-3 victory in the 112th Rose Bowl.",
    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes, Indiana’s defense thoroughly throttled Alabama, and the top-seeded Hoosiers roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 38-3 victory in the 112th Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nMendoza passed for 192 yards in his first game since winning his school’s first Heisman Trophy, but the hard-nosed Hoosiers (14-0, No. 1 CFP seed) won the Rose Bowl for the first time in school history by dominating the Crimson Tide (11-4, No. 9 CFP seed) at the line of scrimmage.\n\nIndiana scored the game’s first 24 points before pouring it on with fourth-quarter rushing TDs from Kaelon Black and Roman Hemby, wrapping up a jubilant win in the 112th edition of the Granddaddy of Them All.\n\nCharlie Becker, Omar Cooper Jr. and Elijah Sarratt caught TD passes, while Black rushed for 99 yards. Indiana outgained Alabama 407-193, steadily delighting a decidedly pro-Indiana crowd that celebrated its long-struggling team’s first Rose Bowl game appearance since 1968 with chants of “Hoosier Daddy?” in the final minutes.\n\nIndiana had not won any bowl game since the Copper Bowl in 1991, but history has been no match for Curt Cignetti and his dominant Hoosiers during the coach’s two transcendent seasons.\n\nThe Hoosiers are headed to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9 for a CFP semifinal rematch with fifth-seeded Oregon, which routed Texas Tech 23-0 earlier Thursday in the Orange Bowl. Indiana beat the then-No. 3 Ducks 30-20 in Eugene last October in one of Cignetti’s most impressive Big Ten victories.\n\nIndiana is two wins away from the first national championship in school history after becoming the first team to advance following a first-round bye in the current 12-team playoff format. The first six bye teams — including the first two this season — couldn’t come back strong from an extra-long layoff, but the Hoosiers took care of business while improving to 25-2 under Cignetti.\n\nThe Crimson Tide’s second season under Kalen DeBoer ended in the same venue as their final season under Nick Saban two years ago. Alabama was outclassed one week after an impressive road win over Oklahoma, managing just 151 yards before the meaningless final minutes of this blowout.\n\nTy Simpson passed for 67 yards before backup Austin Mack replaced him in the third quarter. Mack immediately got the Tide rolling on a 65-yard drive leading to a short field goal, but the Hoosiers responded with two unstoppable TD drives.\n\nIndiana dominated the famous Rose Bowl turf, which stayed pristine despite nearly 24 hours of steady rain before kickoff. The storms dissipated while the Hoosiers took their first-half lead, and blue skies appeared in the second half.\n\nAfter the first scoreless first quarter in a Rose Bowl in 26 years, Indiana’s second drive stretched 84 yards and 16 plays over nearly nine minutes before Nicolas Radicic’s 31-yard field goal on the first snap of the second quarter.\n\nIndiana’s defense then stopped Alabama on fourth and 1 at the Tide 34, and Mendoza fired a long, high pass to the leaping Becker four plays later for a 21-yard touchdown.\n\nSimpson fumbled in Indiana territory after a courageous first-down scramble late in the first half, and the Hoosiers methodically drove for Mendoza’s 1-yard TD pass with 17 seconds left to Cooper, the hero of Indiana’s dramatic victory over Penn State.\n\nAfter halftime, Mendoza led a steady 79-yard drive ending in his 24-yard TD pass to the leaping Sarratt.\n\nThe victory is the latest step in the monumental two-season turnaround of what was the losingest program in college football when Cignetti took charge. After winning 11 games and reaching the CFP last season, the Hoosiers steamrolled through their schedule this fall before beating defending national champion Ohio State for the Big Ten title and ascending to the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 for the first time.\n\nAlabama: It was remarkable to see the most successful program of the 21st century get dominated up front. The Tide’s inability to run the ball was a season-long problem, but it was particularly painful in Pasadena. Whether through personnel or scheme, DeBoer’s offense must take a step forward next year to reach the standard expected at Bama.\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers acted like they’ve been here before, even though they haven’t. Cignetti’s group has a businesslike demeanor that wasn’t remotely altered by Alabama’s reputation and history.\n\nAlabama: Host East Carolina on Sept. 5.\n\nIndiana: A trip to Atlanta to face the powerhouse Ducks, who lost last season’s Rose Bowl to Ohio State as the No. 1 seed.",

    "title": "Trevon Diggs relieved for fresh start, confident he'll make impact with Packers: 'I still feel like I'm the best'",
    "description": "Diggs is optimistic about the opportunity and adjusting to life in Green Bay — he's got a friend in Micah Parsons helping him make the transition.",
    "fullText": "As the saying goes, \"new year, new me.\" It's a timely one for new Green Bay Packers cornerback Trevon Diggs, who was claimed off waivers Wednesday after being released by the Dallas Cowboys Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm not chasing accolades. I'm not chasing anything,\" Diggs told reporters Thursday, New Year's Day, before adding, \"I'm chasing being a better me, being better every day, helping this team win.\"\n\nThe Cowboys moved on from Diggs just two years after signing the two-time Pro Bowl corner to a five-year, $97 million extension.\n\nTrevon Diggs on the level of player he thinks he is:\n\n“Still feel like I’m the best.”\n\nHis locker is three down from Micah Parsons, who he called right after learning the Packers claimed him.\n\n“He told me it’s work, it’s a lot different and he said I’m gonna like it a lot.” pic.twitter.com/9zun21Ougo\n\n— Matt Schneidman (@mattschneidman) January 1, 2026\n\nCowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer said Diggs' release resulted from a \"culmination of multiple factors,\" one of which was the Maryland native straying from protocol and not flying back to Dallas with the team after its Christmas Day road win over the Washington Commanders. Diggs had asked Schottenheimer if he could stay in the D.C. area to see family, but Schottenheimer turned down Diggs, just as he said he rejected requests from other players who had asked to fly separately that week.\n\n\"It was one of many factors,\" Schottenheimer said Wednesday, per ESPN. \"It was not the only factor. I'm not the Grinch that stole Christmas. I love Christmas. I love my family. But at the end of the day, we have a protocol that we go through, and the process was not followed.\"\n\nAnother factor Schottenheimer mentioned was Diggs' performance. After piling up 17 interceptions across his first three seasons in the NFL, including a league-leading 11 as a first-team All-Pro in 2021, the 2020 second-round pick from Alabama has tallied just three picks over the past three seasons.\n\nThis time around, the 27-year-old Diggs has played in eight games and, according to Pro Football Focus, is currently allowing a perfect 158.3 passer rating when targeted. Vocal about his frustration with the Cowboys' defensive scheme this season, he's given up 16 catches on 20 targets for 286 yards and three touchdowns without a single pass break-up or interception, per PFF.\n\nDespite those meager metrics, Diggs still has the confidence of a CB1.\n\n\"I still feel like I'm the best,\" he said Thursday.\n\nInjuries disrupted the brilliant start to his Cowboys career. During practice early in the 2023 campaign, Diggs tore the ACL in his left knee. That injury cost him most of that season.\n\nHe made his way back for the 2024 season, although he later missed time with a groin injury and then was shut down for the year to have another surgery on his left knee.\n\nDiggs was sidelined while rehabbing this past offseason, including during training camp leading up to a Week 1 return that Packers edge rusher Micah Parsons, one of Diggs' close friends, criticized the Cowboys for mismanaging.\n\nDiggs suffered a concussion in October because of an accident at home. A TV that he was trying to mount fell on his head, as reported by NFL Network's Jane Slater last month. Also that month, he was placed on injured reserve due to a right knee injury that had lingered this fall.\n\nHe didn't return until Week 16. By that point, the Cowboys were already eliminated from postseason contention. Diggs said Thursday that he's healthy, joked that he'll be using Taskrabbit for his handyman work from now on and emphasized that he's grateful to be in position to help a contender like the playoff-bound Packers.\n\n\"It's been a great feeling,\" Diggs said. \"They believe in me. I believe in myself, and I'm ready. It's going to be fun.\"\n\nDiggs said he got the call that he was headed to the Packers Wednesday just as he was about to take his kids to Dave & Buster's.\n\nThe trip was tabled, but the moment was celebrated.\n\nThen Diggs contacted Parsons, whom the Cowboys traded to the Packers in late August after an infamous contract standoff.\n\n\"Yeah, I called him right away,\" Diggs said of Parsons. \"He's super excited for me, super happy for me. We have a great relationship — our families, our moms, everyone is real close, so it all worked out.\"\n\nParsons, now a five-time Pro Bowler, logged 12.5 sacks in his first 14 games with Green Bay, however, a torn ACL in Week 15 cut his inaugural Packers campaign short.\n\nWhile the sack artist won't be on the field with Diggs this season, they now share a locker room again. Parsons has offered Diggs a place to crash and a car to drive. He's also provided the corner with some insight about playing for the Packers.\n\n\"He told me it's work. It's a lot different,\" Diggs said. \"He said I'm going to like it a lot, and I'm going to enjoy it. So far I've been enjoying it a lot.\n\n\"My first day was out there today, and I had a lot of fun, and it's a great thing to be here.\"\n\nDiggs admitted that blocking out all the noise surrounding him recently has been a challenge. He's focused on moving forward in the New Year.\n\n\"I want to be here as long as they want me to be here, for sure,\" he said. \"I like it here a lot. I got relationships here already, and I would love to call this place home.\"",

    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins have brought in Hall-of-Fame QB and ESPN analyst Troy Aikman as a consultant to assist with their search for a general manager, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. The three-time Super Bowl champion’s role will not be permanent; he will serve as an advisor throughout the process of finding the Dolphins’ next GM.\n\nDespite Aikman’s lack of front-office experience, it is common for teams to bring in new perspectives when seeking new leadership. Former Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers served as a key advisor during the Washington Commanders' coaching search.\n\nFormer New England Patriots quarterback and Fox analyst Tom Brady has also served as an advisor to Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis in his role as a minority owner.\n\nBrady has assisted the Raiders with insights on football operations, player acquisitions, and their coaching search. Brady has been criticized for having a conflict of interest with his role as a broadcaster and a team owner.\n\nThe biggest difference between Aikman’s role and Brady’s is that Aikman does not have ownership of the team, and his position is temporary. Aikman’s role with the Dolphins will end once they have found their next GM.\n\nIn October, the Dolphins and former general manager Chris Grier decided to mutually part ways after the team’s 2-7 start. Grier had been the general manager since 2016, leading the team to five winning seasons and three playoff appearances during his tenure.\n\nThe new GM will need to work with Dolphins owner Stephen Ross to determine the future direction of the team. The first order of business will be deciding whether head coach Mike McDaniel and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa will remain with the team next year.\n\nMcDaniel is 35–34 as the Dolphins’ head coach and has missed the playoffs in the last two seasons. Tagovailoa is coming off his worst season as a starting quarterback. McDaniel’s contract runs through the 2028 season.\n\nTagovailoa’s 15 interceptions are the second-worst in the NFL, and he was benched for seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers. Tagovailoa signed a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension, which is set to run through the 2028 season.",

Housing, healthcare, childcare, education, and even electricity in some places all seem to be slipping further out of ordinary reach, even as the economy continues to grow.\n\nClassical liberalism offers a straightforward diagnosis and an equally straightforward cure. Remove unnecessary regulations that constrict supply and withdraw subsidies that artificially inflate demand! Yet the year has also provided familiar public choice stories about the obstacles to these sensible solutions. Concentrated interests profit from regulation and subsidies, but their costs are thinly dispersed across millions of consumers. The Trump administration’s renewed push for deregulation offers a glimmer of hope, but 2025 illustrates both the generative power of liberty and the political obstacles from past incursions on our freedoms.\n\nAt bottom, the affordability issue reflects the failure of wages to keep pace with prices. Given that incomes in the United States have generally been increasing, affordability is not a fundamentally macroeconomic problem of stimulating greater economic growth, although, of course, growth would be beneficial. It is, instead, a microeconomic problem in which prices in essential sectors such as housing, medicine, education, and parts of agriculture continue to rise much faster than inflation. What do these sectors have in common? Government intervention in the form of price controls, subsidies, or both. In areas where the government is absent, prices for technological goods or home-delivered household goods through online platforms such as Amazon are decreasing, quality is increasing, or both.\n\nThus, the classical liberal solution to this year’s economic crisis is more of the old-time religion: free markets, open competition, and the elimination of subsidies, particularly to those who are not poor. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. Restrictions on market entry benefit incumbents, who have greater influence with politicians than unorganized entrants. Subsidies drive up prices. But, of course, those enjoying the subsidies have every interest in retaining them. The effect of subsidies on prices is just an economic argument, but for the recipient, the subsidy appears as money in the bank. It is thus unsurprising that they are challenging to eliminate. Political scientists have long observed that legislation tends to deliver concentrated benefits and diffuse costs, even if the diffuse costs far exceed the benefits.\n\nIt is a striking confirmation of the grip of this political truth that the Democratic Party chose to make the administration’s failure to extend new healthcare subsidies the issue on which it shut down the federal government. Moreover, the government’s perennial inability to end any “free” government money was underscored by the fact that these subsidies had originally been sold as a short-term solution to the pandemic and that some of them go to families earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. According to prevailing political consensus, the Democrats won the shutdown with their tactical maneuver, and their opponents, while in the legislative majority, have struggled to develop a politically feasible response.\n\nYet these subsidies increase the cost of healthcare and insurance by making consumers less price-conscious. One solution is to subsidize health insurance only for catastrophic medical events among the poor, rather than day-to-day care for the middle class. Yet, of course, the insurance companies, whose profits are padded by subsidized sign-ups from whatever sources, strongly oppose any such reform.\n\nAnd health insurance is not the only government distortion of the market for medical care. There are numerous supply-side restrictions. Licensing regimes restrict the use of nonphysician providers, and certification-of-need requirements delay the entry of new hospitals, yet doctors and incumbent hospitals benefit from government regulations. The FDA is a barrier for many new drug candidates. Medical care is thus not only a poster child for the affordability crisis but also for government dysfunction.\n\nThe other area most discussed in affordability is housing. Again, developments in 2025 indicate that it will be challenging to reduce housing costs through deregulation. Just as the government shutdown was the most striking federal political event, the most striking local one was the election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City. Not surprisingly for a self-proclaimed socialist, his policies are the opposite of the classical liberal program. He ran on a platform to address affordability through price controls and subsidies, specifically draconian rent controls, as well as “free” childcare and buses.\n\nGiven that bad government regulation is at the heart of the affordability crisis, the most effective antidote is deregulation.\n\nHis platform is more proof of the power of public choice analysis. Economists across the political spectrum oppose rent control because it reduces the housing stock over the long run and disincentivizes housing supply. It is thus a policy that undermines affordability rather than promotes it. Nevertheless, rent control remains politically popular. There are more tenants than landlords, and those who are prevented from moving into the city do not have the right to vote in municipal elections.\n\nThe classical liberal solution would be the opposite. Eliminate rent controls and increase housing supply by weakening zoning regulations. Unfortunately, the latter is almost as unpopular as the former because homeowners benefit from restricted entry that keeps housing prices high, particularly in New York City, where soaring prices make homeowners’ homes a disproportionate share of their net worth.\n\nThe childcare subsidies will raise effective costs, as providers increase their prices to the same extent as colleges have, given government grants and low-cost loans. A better solution would be to deregulate childcare, allowing providers to operate from their own homes, as they did in earlier centuries.\n\nMedicine, housing, and childcare are only a few of the sectors in which the government restricts price competition. For instance, obstructive licensing regimes have impeded infrastructure development. Moreover, some of these impediments have increased energy costs by delaying pipeline construction and the expansion of the electric grid.\n\nGiven that bad government regulation is at the heart of the affordability crisis, the most effective antidote is deregulation. Thus, the most significant source of optimism for classical liberals in 2025 was the Trump administration’s domestic deregulatory agenda. Most importantly, the Trump administration has made substantial changes to the overall regulatory structure. It has emphasized regulatory budgeting and required the deregulation of ten rules for every new rule issued. It has mandated that new regulations be issued, or existing ones survive, only if they are based on the best reading of the statute, thereby suggesting that the administration will reconsider regulations grounded in overly aggressive readings that supported expansive regulation.\n\nIt has also pursued sector-by-sector deregulation. Particularly notable are those that seek to remove regulatory barriers to energy production and to roll back requirements that mandate the production of electric vehicles by automakers. In education, it is moving to allow greater choice among accreditors, making it easier for schools to secure approval for innovative and cost-reducing ideas. It has also focused on deregulating financial services and securities regulation, including crypto, to stimulate capital markets. The more efficient capital markets are, the easier it is for upstarts to challenge incumbents, increasing competition and reducing prices.\n\nNevertheless, many of the regulatory bottlenecks underlying the affordability crisis are at the state and local levels. For instance, the federal government has limited power to influence zoning and state permitting regulations that make new housing expensive to build. Nor can the federal government eliminate the pernicious and growing local rent control.\n\nFortunately, the administration’s focus on deregulating artificial intelligence, an initiative I have discussed before as a mechanism for boosting economic growth, is also likely to address affordability problems caused by the regulation at all levels of government. One of AI’s promises of affordability is that it can reduce regulatory compliance costs, which function as entry barriers, shielding incumbents and pushing smaller firms out of markets altogether. Moreover, AI can reduce costs for diffuse groups, such as consumers seeking to organize against special interests, and publicize the costs of regulation, thereby exerting political pressure for regulatory simplification or elimination.\n\nTake my own field of law. Software is far less effective than AI-enabled online companies at providing low-cost legal assistance for routine legal documents, such as wills and powers of attorney. When the lawyers’ guild argued that such aid was illegal as the unauthorized practice of law, our words of decentralized media helped build pressure in states like Texas to exempt these new practices from such legal prohibitions. Thus, technology can both cut the cost of providing expert advice and reduce the barriers that protect incumbents from competition.\n\nThus, the rise of artificial intelligence will help address the affordability crisis, at least initially, by reducing fixed compliance costs, weakening entry barriers, and assisting diffuse interests in organizing against regulatory excess. But that same promise will invite efforts to convert the legitimate needs for “AI safety” into the next regulatory moat.\n\nWhether AI can continue to improve affordability depends on which impulse prevails. Will it be the use of innovative technologies to expand competition and supply, or their capture by incumbents seeking new protection? History suggests no final victory. The struggle for affordability is never finished because it is essentially a struggle for liberty. It must be renewed generation by generation.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has publicly humiliated his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt by contradicting her repeated reassurances and excuses about his health woes.\n\nSince Trump, 79, returned to office last January, speculation has raged over bruising on his hands and about his cognitive ability, particularly after he underwent a mystery scan in the fall—with the Daily Beast leading the way on reporting the president’s various medical issues, including his swollen cankles.\n\nLeavitt, 28, has repeatedly claimed the reason for the discoloration on the back of his right hand—which the president has covered up with band-aids, bandages, and thick make-up—is that as “a man of the people,” Trump “meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nWhile Leavitt has also attributed the bruising to the president’s routine aspirin use, she has often led her responses to questions about Trump’s hands by blaming his handshaking, including when questioned on the matter earlier this month by the Beast’s political correspondent Farrah Tomazin.\n\n“The president is literally constantly shaking hands, the Oval Office is like Grand Central Terminal,” she explained earlier this month.\n\nDays after the bruising appeared to spread to Trump’s left hand—which he does not use to greet people—the president on Thursday gave a revelatory interview about his health to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump offered a different reason for the bruising: overuse of aspirin and his thinning skin.\n\nHe told the Journal that he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin a day—four times the 81-milligram “low dose” commonly used in daily therapy, per the Mayo Clinic—despite conceding his doctors have urged him to take less.\n\nThis higher-than-recommended aspirin use, Trump said, has become a central factor in the bruising that’s been spotted on his hands. But he told the outlet he refuses to reduce the dose because he’s been on the same routine for decades, and is “a little superstitious.”\n\nTrump also said he wears makeup because he has soft skin, and it bruises when it gets “whacked.”\n\nDiscussing an episode in which Attorney General Pam Bondi, 60, nicked him during a high-five, he told the Journal: “The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut.”\n\nHe added that he puts makeup on his hands after he gets “whacked again by someone,” saying: “I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds.”\n\nTrump also gave more details about his October scan, further embarrassing Leavitt, who has fended off repeated inquiries about it from the White House podium.\n\nShe at first repeatedly answered questions without naming the test and leaning on scripted assurances about his condition. On October 23, she declined to specify what test he received. On November 4, pressed on why Trump had a week earlier described it as an MRI, she said she would “check back,” while insisting he was in “optimal physical health” and framing the Walter Reed visit as a routine follow-up.\n\nWhen asked again on November 12, Leavitt leaned on the language of the doctor’s memo, reiterating that Trump received “advanced imaging” as part of a routine exam and that physicians considered him in “exceptional” condition, without explaining why the imaging was ordered.\n\nLeavitt’s position remained the same until December 1, when Trump’s physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, released a memo describing cardiovascular imaging. Leavitt told reporters the screening was normal and positioned the disclosure as transparency.\n\nEven then, the White House’s preferred shorthand remained “advanced imaging,” rather than a clear, consistent label for what Trump had undergone.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Trump said he’d been telling people it was an MRI, but then corrected it: “It wasn’t an MRI… It was less than that. It was a scan.” He complained that getting the test had handed critics “ammunition” because it fueled questions about whether something was wrong.\n\nThe Journal reported that Trump and Barbabella ultimately characterized the procedure as a CT scan performed to rule out cardiovascular issues, with no abnormalities found.\n\nLeavitt is quoted in the Journal saying the White House had “often referred to the procedure as ‘advanced imaging,’” while not addressing why Trump didn’t correct the MRI/CT description sooner.\n\nIn the Journal article, Trump also discussed his ‘cankles’ and why he apparently cannot stay awake during public meetings.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and Leavitt for comment.",

Unfortunately, a Christmas-themed product from Aldi might've left some customers with more than a bad taste in their mouths.\n\nThe Independent reported that the U.K. supermarket chain recalled Perfect Christmas Mozzarella Sticks in Blankets from its stores. This product contains egg, which wasn't listed on the packaging.\n\n\"Customers are asked to return this product to their nearest store, where a full refund will be given,\" Aldi wrote in the recall notice. \"We apologise that this product did not meet our normal high standards and thank you for your co-operation.\"\n\nThe affected product was sold in 278-gram (about 9.8-ounce) packages with a use-by date of December 15. The U.K. Food Standards Agency (FSA) urged consumers with allergies or intolerance to eggs to return the product instead of rolling the dice.\n\nCustomers can make good on Aldi's refund, in any case. Aldi also informed customers that they could receive more information via a phone number or on help.aldi.co.uk.\n\nLabel accuracy is crucial for managing food intolerance and allergies. When companies fail to list allergens, consumers must depend on others for accurate information.\n\nSomeone with an egg allergy could have a serious reaction when they were simply trying to enjoy some seasonal mozz sticks. You can imagine the potential consequences, including a possible trip to the hospital.\n\nEggs are one of the 14 allergens the FSA requires to be declared, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers them one of the \"Big 9\" allergies that are leading causes of reactions and symptoms.\n\nFood recalls often highlight broader concerns in the food production industry, including a lack of oversight or inconsistent safety standards.  These failures can result in cross-contamination between different products or the inclusion of unlisted allergens and hazardous materials into food.\n\nThat can have significant implications for households.

Because humans are involved, there's always a chance something can slip through the cracks.\n\nThat's where it becomes incumbent on consumers to raise the alarm if something is off on a food item. Regulators can broadcast that message quickly and minimize the damage with comprehensive and expedient recall notices.\n\nThe next step falls to producers to find out where things went sideways and address any lingering issues that led to the mistake.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Now that the Kansas City Chiefs have committed to building a new stadium and team headquarters in Kansas, what’s next for the Truman Sports Complex?\n\nWhile the Royals could still renew their lease with Jackson County, county legislator Manny Abarca says it’s time to start thinking about the future of the land.\n\n“At the end of 2031, December 1, something will change and we want to be ready for that with a plan, with a strategy, if we’ve got to tear down one or two stadiums, we should be prepared for that, not waiting for after the fact,” Abarca said.\n\nAbarca wrote a letter to Jackson County Executive Phil LeVota on Wednesday, with a plan to use the existing Repair, Maintenance, Management, and Operations (RMMO) fund to set aside money for the potential demolition of one or both stadiums and the redevelopment of the land.\n\n“We’ve got to have a strategic plan going forward,” Abarca said.\n\n“That opportunity of us, scrapping some of that maintenance and repair money towards the strategic plan is still within our RMMO accounts. So, there’s some opportunity. We just have to be willing to do it.”\n\nCurrently, a 3/8 cent sales tax sends roughly $55 million annually to the complex’s upkeep and renovations. Saving half of that money over the course of the next 5 years could amount to north of $137 million.\n\nAs for what’s next for the land, Abarca says it could be of huge benefit for the county.\n\n“I think we can look at that as a county park, as a county asset. There were houses there before and so I think there’s an opportunity to look at that as a public housing option if there aren’t stadiums there. It’s adjacent to our Rock Island corridor, which is currently a bike route, but could be a mass transit route. There’s a lot of opportunity, right? Its geographic location is really center of our county.”\n\nWhether the Royals decide to stay at Truman or leave, Abarca says it’s time to be prepared for the next phase of that land.\n\n“Before taxpayers were asked to fund stadiums, this was a green space. These were neighborhoods. These were communities. There’s vibrancy that was there before. Now, instead of walking away with an abandoned stadium, that can be 30 to 50 to $70 million to tear down and maybe two of those, it can at least be a green space.”",

We're here to help with that as well.\n\nWordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that debuted in 2021. There is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.\n\nWordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that shows how they fare each day in a spoiler-free way. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.\n\nThe New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.\n\nTo start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard. However, you can still use those letters in subsequent guesses.\n\nYou'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.\n\nWordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets and Discord. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.\n\nIf you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,600 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.\n\nIn addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.\n\nBefore today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed:\n\nYesterday's Wordle answer for Wednesday, December 31 — SIREN\n\nEvery day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word.\n\nIn case you still haven't quite figured it out by that point, we'll then provide the first letter of the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle.\n\nThis should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly. Spoilers are ahead.\n\nHere is a hint for today's Wordle answer:\n\nA short story akin to a fairy tale that has a moral lesson to impart.\n\nThere are no repeated letters in today's Wordle answer.\n\nThe first letter of today's Wordle answer is F.\n\nThis is your final warning before we reveal today's Wordle answer. No take-backs.\n\nDon't blame us if you happen to scroll too far and accidentally spoil the game for yourself.\n\nWhat is today’s Wordle? Today's Wordle answer is...\n\nNot to worry if you didn't figure out today's Wordle word. If you made it this far down the page, hopefully you at least kept your streak going. And, hey: there's always another game tomorrow.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Widening demonstrations sparked by Iran's ailing economy spread Thursday into the Islamic Republic's rural provinces, with at least seven people being killed in the first fatalities reported among security forces and protesters, authorities said.\n\nThe deaths may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran’s theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded elsewhere. The fatalities, two on Wednesday and five on Thursday, occurred in four cities, largely home to Iran’s Lur ethnic group.\n\nThe protests have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the demonstrations have yet to be countrywide and have not been as intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.\n\nThe most-intense violence appeared to strike Azna, a city in Iran's Lorestan province, some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of Tehran. There, online videos purported to show objects in the street ablaze and gunfire echoing as people shouted: “Shameless! Shameless!”\n\nThe semiofficial Fars news agency reported three people had been killed. Other media, including pro-reform outlets, cited Fars for the report while state-run media did not fully acknowledge the violence there or elsewhere. It wasn't clear why there wasn't more reporting over the unrest, but journalists had faced arrest over their reporting in 2022.\n\nIn Lordegan, a city in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, online videos showed demonstrators gathered on a street, with the sound of gunfire in the background. The footage matched known features of Lordegan, some 470 kilometers (290 miles) south of Tehran.\n\nFars, citing an anonymous official, said two people had been killed during the protests Thursday.\n\nThe Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said two people had been killed there, identifying the dead as demonstrators. It also shared a still image of what appeared to be an Iranian police officer, wearing body armor and wielding a shotgun.\n\nIn 2019, the area around Lordegan saw widespread protests and demonstrators reportedly damaged government buildings after a report said people there had been infected with HIV by contaminated needles used at a local health care clinic.\n\nIn Fuladshahr in Iran's Isfahan province, state media reported on the death of a man there Thursday that activist groups attributed to the police opening fire on demonstrators.\n\n'Protests due to economic pressures'\n\nA separate demonstration Wednesday night reportedly led to the 21-year-old volunteer in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Basij force.\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member’s death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, which is believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Lorestan province.\n\nThe Guard member “was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defense of public order,” he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.\n\n“The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns,\" Pourali said. \"The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.”\n\nThe protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, over 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Tehran. Local prosecutor Kazem Nazari said 20 people had been arrested after the protests and that calm had returned to the city, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.\n\nIran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters. However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.\n\nMeanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had linked to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.\n\nIran's theocracy had declared Wednesday a public holiday across much of the country, citing cold weather, likely as a bid to get people out of the capital for a long weekend. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.\n\nThe protests, taking root in economic issues, have heard demonstrators chant against Iran's theocracy as well. The country's leaders are still reeling after Israel launched a 12-day war against the country in June. The U.S. also bombed Iranian nuclear sites during the war.\n\nIran has said it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program to ease sanctions. However, those talks have yet to happen as U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have warned Tehran against reconstituting its atomic program.",

    "description": "In 1930, archaeologists found he lower half of a massive statue of Ramesses II. Now, they've discovered the long-missing top half in pristine condition.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nIn 1930, German archaeologists uncovered the lower half of a massive statue, estimating that it likely originally stood some 23 feet tall.\n\nNow, U.S. and Egyptian archaeologists have announced the discovery of the long-missing top half in thankfully pristine condition.\n\nA proposal has already been submitted to unite the bottom with the long-missing top half, and the discoverers are confident of its approval.\n\nSome 96 years ago, German archaeologist Günther Roeder unearthed the lower half of what would’ve been a massive, 23-foot-tall statue of Ramesses II—one of the most celebrated pharaohs throughout all 31 dynasties of Ancient Egyptian history. Roeder found the statue 150 miles south of Cairo in the Minya Governorate, near the modern-day city of El Ashmunein. In ancient times, this area along the Nile was known as Khemnu. It served as a provincial capital in the Old Kingdom of Egypt (2649–2130 BCE), and was later called Hermopolis Magna when Romans ruled the Mediterranean.\n\nMany treasures of the region’s illustrious past were known to be buried in the surrounding desert, and while Roeder’s discovery proved remarkable, the rest of the enormous statue he found remained lost to time … until now.\n\nIn March 2024, the Egyptian archaeologists—in partnership with U.S. experts—announced that after 96 years, they’d finally found the missing upper half of Roeder’s statute. Speaking with Reuters, the experts from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities reported that the upper half stretched some 12.5 feet tall, and depicted Ramesses II wearing a headdress topped with a royal cobra.\n\nHowever, the discovery of this ancient statue—and exquisite preservation—was far from certain when the statue was first discovered lying face down in January 2024.\n\n“One problem with Hermopolis is that it’s close to the Nile. After [the building of] the Aswan Low Dam, the water table became a huge issue. There was no guarantee that the stone would be OK,” Yvona Trnka-Amrhein, assistant professor of classics at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-leader of the team said in a press statement. “Sometimes sandstone is uncovered that is basically just sand or degraded limestone. It could have just been a lump of rock.”\n\nLuckily, after further excavation, the team confirmed that the statue was remarkably well-preserved and contained another amazing find—traces of blue-and-yellow pigment could be found on the statue’s surface. Hopefully, further analysis of this pigment will help researchers understand the context of the statue’s creation, as well as its original appearance.\n\n“We knew it might be there, but we were not specifically looking for it,” Trnka-Amrhein said in a press statement. “It was plausible that the rest of the statue might be there, but it was a total surprise.”\n\nThankfully, the hunch proved correct, and Egyptian co-leader Basem Gehad has already submitted a proposal to reunite the two pieces together at long last (Roeder’s lower half still remains on site in El Ashmunein). Trnka-Amrhein expects it to be approved.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump may now be having trouble walking across flat surfaces.\n\nThe president appeared to be hiding a slight limp as he was filmed walking with his wife, Melania, at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe new speculation over the 79-year-old’s health came after he revealed in an interview that he tried compression socks for his swollen ankles and used makeup to cover the bruising on his hands caused by large daily doses of aspirin.\n\nThe popular anti-Trump X account Call to Activism posted a clip of Trump appearing to drag his right leg as he walked down a runway toward the press gathered to snap attendees of his ritzy New Year’s Eve party.\n\nThe account, which has over 1.1 million followers, wrote, ″Trump just showed up at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate New Year’s, dragging his right leg, and quickly adjusted his walk when he realizes the cameras are on. What’s Trump hiding?\"\n\nIn the clip, Trump can be seen slightly limping as he enters the frame, but after a few steps, he adopts a steadier gait before he and First Lady Melania Trump stop to pose for photographs.\n\nViewers were split on whether the clip showed a new medical malady for the oldest president in American history or if it was no big deal.\n\n“It pretty obvious [sic] he is dragging his right leg. If Biden had done that every news station would have this video up all day all time about his health,” wrote one suspicious viewer on X.\n\n“Honestly? Probably nothing,” said a less-convinced X user. “He knows the cameras are always watching, so of course he adjusted. Not every awkward step means there’s something being hidden.”\n\nOn Monday, the nearly octogenarian president had difficulty descending four small steps at Mar-a-Lago. On multiple occasions, he has descended the steps on Air Force One at a snail’s pace.\n\nHe has also been filmed struggling to walk in straight lines and dragging his right leg in public for years.\n\nWednesday’s Mar-a-Lago entrance comes amidst intensified speculation about Trump’s health issues, which the Daily Beast has led the charge in covering.\n\nThese include persistent bruising on his hands, difficulty sleeping through the night and staying awake during the day, and chronic venous insufficiency, which has caused his ankles to swell.\n\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump personally called the publication to complain about the persistent coverage of his health and attempted to set the record straight on some health mysteries that have dogged his second term.\n\nTrump told the publication that he takes quadruple the common dose of aspirin for “cardiac prevention,” and that is what causes the bruising on his hands.\n\nThe piece did not address speculation about Trump’s ambling gait. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the president’s Mar-a-Lago entrance.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast reported on Trump taking a circuitous route between Marine One and Air Force One in September, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the publication, “You must be f-----g blind or stupid, because that was a perfect walk.”",

    "fullText": "CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — Swiss investigators are probing what caused a fire in a bar at an Alpine ski resort that left around 40 people dead and another 115 injured during a New Year's celebration.\n\nMost injuries, many of them serious, occurred when the blaze swept through the crowded bar less than two hours after midnight Thursday in southwestern Switzerland.\n\nThe Crans-Montana resort is best known as an international ski and golf venue. Overnight, its crowded Le Constellation bar morphed from a scene of revelry into the site of potentially one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.\n\nCrans-Montana is less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Sierre, Switzerland, where 28 people, including many children, were killed when a bus from Belgium crashed inside a Swiss tunnel in 2012.\n\nHere’s what we know about the deadly fire:\n\nThe blaze broke out around 1:30 a.m. Thursday inside the Le Constellation bar amid the holiday celebration.\n\nTwo women told French broadcaster BFMTV they were inside when they saw a male bartender lifting a female bartender on his shoulders as she held a lit candle in a bottle. The flames spread, collapsing the wooden ceiling, they told the broadcaster.\n\nPeople frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door, causing a crowd surge, one of the women said.\n\nA young man at the scene said people smashed windows to escape the fire, some gravely injured, reported BFMTV. He said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames, likening what happened to a horror movie.\n\nThe injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theater at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, said Mathias Reynard, head of the regional government of the Valais Canton.\n\nOfficials rule out possible attack\n\nWhile officials said Thursday it was too early to determine the fire's cause, investigators have already ruled out that it could have been an attack.\n\nExperts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage, said Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, at a news conference.\n\nWork is underway to identify the victims and inform their families, according to Valais Canton police commander Frédéric Gisler.\n\nThe blaze triggered a flashover or backdraft\n\nThe Swiss officials called the blaze an “embrasement généralisé,” a French firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.\n\nVictims suffered from serious burns and smoke inhalation. Some were flown to specialist hospitals across the country.\n\nAuthorities urged people to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require the already overwhelmed medical resources.\n\nA top venue for the world's best athletes\n\nWith high-altitude ski runs rising around 3,000 meters (nearly 9,850 feet) in the heart of the Valais region’s snowy peaks and pine forests, Crans-Montana is one of the top venues on the World Cup circuit.\n\nThe resort will host the best men’s and women’s downhill racers, including Lindsey Vonn, for their final events before the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.\n\nThe town’s Crans-sur-Sierre golf club, down the street from the bar, stages the European Masters each August on a picturesque course.\n\nDazio reported from Berlin and Leicester reported from Paris. Geir Moulson in Berlin and Graham Dunbar in Geneva contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek has ushered in 2026 with a new technical paper, co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng, that proposes a rethink of the fundamental architecture used to train foundational AI models.\n\nThe method - dubbed Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) - forms part of the Hangzhou firm's push to make its models more cost-effective as it strives to keep pace with better-funded US rivals with deeper access to computing power.\n\nIt also reflected the increasingly open, collaborative culture among Chinese AI companies, which have published a growing share of their research in public.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nFor industry watchers, DeepSeek's papers often provide an important early signal of the engineering choices that will shape the start-up's next major model release.\n\nIn the paper, released on Thursday, a team of 19 DeepSeek researchers said they tested mHC on models with 3 billion, 9 billion and 27 billion parameters, and found it scaled without adding significant computational burden.\n\n\"Empirical results confirm that mHC effectively ... [enables] stable large-scale training with superior scalability compared with conventional HC (hyper-connections),\" wrote the researchers, led by Zhenda Xie, Yixuan Wei and Huanqi Cao.\n\nLiang was listed as the final author.\n\nThe team added that \"crucially, through efficient infrastructure-level optimisations,\" mHC delivers these gains with \"negligible computational overhead\".\n\nThe publication also offered fresh evidence that Liang, who has kept a low profile despite DeepSeek's increasing fame, remains closely involved in core research at one of China's most closely watched AI companies.\n\nHyper-connections were first proposed by ByteDance researchers in September 2024 as a tweak to ResNet (residual networks) - a dominant deep learning architecture introduced in 2015 by Microsoft Research Asia scientists including legendary Chinese computer scientist He Kaiming.\n\nResNet enables the training of very deep neural networks by stabilising the training so that key information, or residual, is retained as the number of layers increases.\n\nThe paper was uploaded to the open-access repository arXiv by DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng himself, who has also posted DeepSeek's more prominent technical papers in recent years.

Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nIt has become integral to major large language models such as OpenAI's GPT as well as Google DeepMind's Nobel-winning AlphaFold system.\n\nHowever, ResNet has notable limitations, including difficulty ensuring that the learning signal that flows through the neural network remains strong without \"collapsing\" into a one-size-fits-all state.\n\nAccording to the DeepSeek researchers, ByteDance's HC solution successfully addressed these issues by expanding the residual stream and enhancing the complexity of the neural network, \"without altering the computational overhead of individual units.\"\n\nDeepSeek argued, however, that the earlier approach did not fully account for rising memory costs, leaving its \"practical scalability\" constrained for large-model training.\n\nInstead, they proposed an additional tweak that \"constrains\" the HC network with a specific manifold to ensure compute and cost efficiency.\n\n\"mHC will help address current limitations and potentially illuminate new pathways for the evolution of next-generation foundational architectures,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe paper was uploaded to the open-access repository arXiv by DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng himself, who has also posted DeepSeek's more prominent technical papers in recent years, including work linked to its R1 and V3 models.\n\nOther less important papers have typically been uploaded by other researchers.\n\nFlorian Brand, a PhD student at Germany's Trier University and an expert on China's AI ecosystem, said DeepSeek's papers often acted as an early signal of the technical direction behind its next generation of models.\n\nIndustry expectations are running high that DeepSeek could release its next major model in the run-up to the Spring Festival holiday in mid-February.\n\nPreviously, the company released its groundbreaking R1 model on the eve of last year's national holiday, fuelling speculation it could repeat that playbook this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

    "description": "Bitcoin price enters 2026 in a stalemate. A 1% move at key levels could reveal the winner between buyers and sellers.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin price enters 2026 stuck in the same buyer-seller fight that kept it muted through late 2025. The price is almost flat over the past 30 days, down about 0.6%, which shows how neither side has taken control.\n\nIt is still down about 7% year on year. This balance of pressure has turned into a stalemate. However, a 1% or even a 3.5% move from here could decide the next direction if the right conditions appear.\n\nBitcoin is trading inside a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. This shape shows the market trapped between lower highs and higher lows, hinting at the buyer-seller tussle. Capital flows are not helping the upside.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has trended lower since December 10. For the unversed, the CMF measures how much money flows into or out of an asset. It shows a bearish divergence now because the BTC price has trended higher between December 18 and December 31, while the CMF made lower lows. That signals continued outflows and selling pressure.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nThis negative capital flow is being partially offset by exchange outflows.\n\nExchange net position change shows coins leaving exchanges. That often hints at accumulation. On December 19, exchange outflows were about 16,563 BTC. By January 1, they rose to 38,508 BTC.\n\nThat is an increase of about 132%. This push of coins leaving exchanges helps price stability and keeps the lower trendline of the triangle protected.\n\nSmart Money Index readings confirm the lack of direction. The Smart Money Index compares how larger, informed traders position versus the broader market. The line is hugging its signal line with no clear separation. That hints that larger traders are waiting for a breakout and not betting on either direction yet.\n\nUntil the breakout happens, the triangle stays neutral.\n\nThis matches what CMF and exchange flow data are saying. Outflows signal pressure. Exchange withdrawals signal support. Together, they cancel each other and hold the BTC price still. And even the most informed traders are unsure as to which side would win.\n\nThe cost basis heat map highlights clusters where many buyers last bought. These clusters often act like support or resistance. The nearest resistance zone is around $88,082 to $88,459, where about 200,035 BTC sit.\n\nBitcoin is trading near $87,480. A daily close roughly 1% higher would put the price above that zone. That could act as the first bullish trigger and settle the upper triangle break. On the BTC price chart, the level aligning with this cluster is $88,300, which needs to break first.",

    "description": "I'm keeping track of Trump's economy right here. Every month. Enjoy!",
    "fullText": "(AKA the unemployment rate, cost of eggs, gas prices, inflation, the Dow Jones, whether citizens received a stimulus check, and Trump's overall approval rating.)\n\nIt wasn't exactly convincing, considering Americans are facing massive insurance hikes in 2026 because Trump and his party recently chose to allow Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire in two weeks. Likewise, our pockets are shrinking as the cost of food and living bloat.\n\nNote: Data on inflation is released a few weeks after each month has ended, so our reports will look at the previous month's numbers.\n\nGetting data on the unemployment rate between September and November has been plagued and vague due to the government shutdown this year. September's numbers were late. October's rate was altogether canceled, and November appears to have come in at 4.6% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFor someone who brags about a booming economy, the steady increase in Americans searching for work sure doesn't bode well for the president's claims.\n\nAh, the price of eggs. Another cursed number.\n\nFood indexes are also released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and so we won't be getting an October number. I can, however, report that eggs officially dropped under the $3 mark, and you can find a grade A dozen for around $2.86 on average in November.\n\nShifting from a positive to a negative, the cost of beef is still skyrocketing, and I continue to find that giving up red meat this year was one of the best financial decisions I've made.\n\nIf you're looking for a pound of beef, prices jumped to $6.50 on average in November.\n\n(And yes, the government shutdown is still acting as the Ghost of Christmas past, and we will not be getting an October average here either.)\n\nGas is going down, though! I'm sure y'all will flood the comment section with local prices wayyyyy higher than the national average, and wish you saw numbers as low as this, but according to the Energy Information Administration, a gallon of gasoline cost around $3.179 last month.\n\nInflation dropped to its lowest point in months, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2.7% figure has raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \"For the inflation report, many economists were caught off guard by the way the B.L.S. handled the distortions, which is part of why they are casting so much doubt on the numbers published today.\"\n\nThe above is fancy speak to say that the government shutdown caused \"distortions\" in the data surrounding inflation, and so it may or may not paint a prettier picture than reality.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones neither rose nor fell in November, according to Stat Muse. So, there's that.\n\nWe're approaching a full year under Trump's second presidency, and there's still no stimulus check in sight for struggling Americans. What happened to those $2,000 tariff dividend checks Trump promised on Truth Social? I haven't heard a single word of it since Nov. 9.\n\nYIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES.

YIKES.\n\nTrump's approval rating hit an all-time low for this term. Gallup reports that only 36% of Americans approve of how Trump's second presidency is going. It's looking BLEAK.\n\nIt's not uncommon for me to see comments from conservatives who claim the data presented in this report is \"fake news.\" Usually, I point to the fact that the data is retrieved from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Energy Administration, which fall under Trump's own administration. So, if the numbers are \"fake news,\" that would mean these MAGA commenters believe Trump's people are spreading fake news...\n\nI appreciate the readership, regardless. <3\n\nAlso in In the News: 27 Photos Of Donald Trump In 2025 He Probably Reaaaaaally Doesn't Want You To See\n\nAlso in In the News: \"Oh My God\": People Are Not Holding Back AT ALL After Trump Made Another White House \"Upgrade,\" And Hoo Boy, You Gotta See This One\n\nAlso in In the News: Donald Trump Hated His Time Magazine Cover...

In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.\n\nSenior Trump officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors. But such restrictions go against recommendations from major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",

Gox exchange and waning interest after its first major speculative cycle.\n\nPrices recovered steadily over the next two years.\n\nThat momentum culminated at the beginning of 2018, when Bitcoin opened the year near $13,657 after a historic rally in late 2017.\n\nThe surge marked the asset’s first mainstream breakthrough but also preceded a sharp reversal.\n\nBitcoin’s price fell to about $3,843 by Jan. 1, 2019, as the market unwound what many critics had labelled a speculative bubble.\n\nHowever, the decline did not mark the end of the asset’s growth.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2021, it traded near $29,374, supported by growing institutional adoption and looser global monetary conditions.\n\nThe rally continued into early 2022, with Bitcoin opening the year near $47,686, before tightening monetary policy and a series of crypto-sector failures triggered another steep downturn.\n\nBitcoin entered 2023 trading at roughly $16,625, reflecting widespread risk aversion after high-profile exchange collapses and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nPrices rebounded strongly over the following year, rising to about $44,167 at the start of 2024.\n\nBTC began 2025 at approximately $94,419, near record highs.\n\nIn 2025, technical analysts suggest that Bitcoin’s recent weakness may persist beyond the holiday period.\n\nValdrin Tahiri, an analyst at CCN, said seasonal trading patterns offer little support for a near-term reversal.",

    "title": "I visited Amsterdam for the first time with my family — here are 4 things that surprised me most about our trip",
    "description": "Our first trip to Amsterdam as a family was great, but there are mistakes I wish we avoided and tips I wish we knew before we got to the Netherlands.",
    "fullText": "I'd long imagined Amsterdam as a picturesque city of canals, tulips, and windmills.\n\nHowever, visiting for the first time with my husband and 11-year-old twins quickly showed me a few surprising realities that coexist alongside those postcard-worthy views.\n\nFrom its frenetic bike culture to its unexpected culinary influences, the city challenged some of my assumptions even as it reinforced others.\n\nHere's what surprised me most about my first time in Amsterdam.\n\nI was already aware of Amsterdam's reputation as a cycling city — thanks to its flat, compact geography.\n\nBut until you're standing at a crosswalk with hundreds of bikes whizzing by in every direction, it's hard to really internalize just how central cycling is to daily life.\n\nThere are more bikes than residents here, and riders of all ages commute with precision and speed.\n\nI spotted the littlest kids perching on handlebars (or even riding their own bikes in the street), people texting while biking, and lots of cyclists running red lights … all while tourists like us scrambled to get out of the way.\n\nLocals aren't aggressive so much as efficient per se; bikes are treated like vehicles, with their own rules and right-of-way. We learned quickly to look both ways — twice — before stepping into a lane.\n\nIt didn't take me long to realize that my idea of renting bikes for a leisurely family ride through town was not going to be the casual thing I'd thought we might be up for.\n\nTo get around, we mostly relied on Amsterdam's trams and buses. They ran on time, were comfortable, and took us pretty much everywhere we wanted to go.\n\nBut we had a major issue on our way out of town: Since our family of four had lots of luggage for a two-week jaunt through multiple European cities, we called an Uber to get us to the train station when it was time to leave.\n\nThis turned out to be a disaster. We left with what we thought should have been plenty of time, but we got stuck in gridlock traffic for far longer than anticipated.\n\nFinally, we ended up jumping out of the unmoving car mid-ride and into a bus (with all our luggage), which we hoped would get us to the train station faster, since they have dedicated lanes.\n\nBut by then, it was too late; we ultimately missed our train. At least now I understand why so many locals skip cars entirely.\n\nAt our hotel, I asked the concierge for local recommendations for a celebratory dinner on the evening of my twins' birthday.\n\nShe explained that many traditional Dutch foods are prepared in people's homes, so there isn't as huge of a dining-out culture for this cuisine as I'd expected. So she recommended we get a traditional meal of \"rijsttafel,\" or \"rice table,\" at an Indonesian restaurant.\n\nRijsttafel is a Dutch-Indonesian feast born of the country's colonial ties to Indonesia — the Netherlands colonized Indonesia for roughly 350 years.\n\nIt's presented family-style, with tons of small dishes in the middle of the table for sampling, and served with rice — think satay, rendang, sambal (chili pastes), and vegetables.\n\nThe variety lets us sample a wide range of flavors, textures, and spices. It was incredible.\n\nAmsterdam has a strong reputation for its permissive sex and drug culture, which we didn't seek out on a family trip. However, this vibe did seep into things like naughty souvenirs and street art, which slightly raised a couple of tween eyebrows.\n\nThat said, we generally found Amsterdam to be incredibly family-friendly. The walkable, compact city is filled with cultural attractions and parks, so even with kids in tow, it didn't feel overwhelming.\n\nMy twins were able to navigate on foot, hop easily on trams, explore the sprawling Vondelpark greenspace, and sample kid-friendly treats, such as warm stroopwafels, from street vendors.\n\nAside from obvious venues for adults, we didn't come across many spots where visitors had to be a certain age to step inside, which helped our whole family feel included. Kids seemed to be welcome all over, even in restaurants and pubs where we might not expect to see them back home in the US.",

    "title": "Interior designers share 6 living-room trends that'll be huge this year, and 2 on their way out",
    "description": "We asked interior designers about 2026 living-room trends. Color capping, antique decor, and mirror TVs are in, and harsh overhead lighting is out.",
    "fullText": "Living rooms are often considered the heart of the home, serving as a versatile space for hosting guests, spending quality time with loved ones, and relaxing after a long day.\n\nSo, if there's any room in your house that should feel warm, inviting, and full of personal touches, it should be this one.\n\nWith that in mind, Business Insider asked five interior designers to share insight on what will be popular in living rooms this coming year, and which fads are on their way out.\n\nHere's what they predict will be in and out for living rooms in 2026.\n\nAccording to Candace Griffin, principal designer and founder of Candace Mary Interiors, color capping will be a popular living-room trend this year.\n\nUnlike color drenching, which covers an entire room's walls in a single hue, color capping uses multiple shades from the same tone to create movement, depth, and a more polished look.\n\n\"Color capping can sometimes be used to draw your eye up, to make your ceilings feel taller,\" Griffin said. \"… It serves a functional purpose, but also just gives you another opportunity to have some fun in the space.\"\n\nUltra-glam light fixtures will also lose popularity to soft, antique-style lamps in 2026, said Kara Thomas, interior designer and founder of Studio KT.\n\nThat said, the trend toward unique antiques will extend beyond lamps and sconces.\n\n\"I think the desire to fill a home with antiques and thoughtfully sourced items stems from a desire to be more unique, especially with the internet flooded with a lot of rinse-and-repeat ideas,\" Thomas said.\n\nFor that reason, she believes we will see more rustic decor, mixed metals, and vintage artwork and frames in living rooms this year.\n\nInterior designer Molly Torres Portnof of DATE Interiors said she predicts a shift toward more distinctive, intimate, and creative layouts.\n\nThis could look like incorporating a cozy reading nook or a small playroom for the kids into your living room.\n\n\"If you have the space to create separate conversation areas, you can get creative with those corners and niches,\" Griffin added. \"[It's] really just maximizing every inch of the space and not feeling like you have to be in a box, per se.\"\n\nHandmade, wooden furniture and handwoven textiles will be everywhere in 2026, according to Molly Miller, principal designer and founder of Molly Miller Interiors.\n\n\"These elements add depth and authenticity that mass-produced items simply can't match,\" she said.\n\nThese particular elements are also becoming increasingly important as people gravitate toward home spaces that feel inviting, timeless, and emotionally calming, Miller added.\n\nOftentimes, people want to put a mirror on the wall or above their fireplace, but feel like they don't have the room to fit it next to a TV.\n\nWith that in mind, Torres Portnof said she's excited about the possibility of mirror TVs taking over living-room spaces.\n\nAs the name suggests, a mirror TV looks like a sleek, framed mirror when turned off and appears like a high-definition television when turned on.\n\n\"I love the fact that it's dual-purpose, and I think others will as well,\" she said.\n\nAs more people turn toward designs that evoke warmth and comfort, designers expect soothing, earthy palettes to become everyone's go-to choice for living-room colors.\n\n\"Everything is leaning more toward earthy tones,\" said Thomas. In particular, she sees burgundy, deep browns, olive greens, and darker blues taking over living rooms this year and beyond.\n\nDanielle Chiprut, interior designer and founder of Danielle Rose Design Co., believes that bland, cold-feeling spaces are becoming outdated.\n\nInstead, she predicts a growing shift toward heavily textured living-room designs with warmer colors, patterned sofas, and personalized elements.\n\n\"We're moving away from that minimalist, modern design and into a more layered, cozy [layout],\" Chiprut said.\n\nFurthermore, as living rooms become less sterile and showroom-like, Griffin is also seeing a general pull toward spaces that feel truly \"lived in.\"\n\n\"The real way to achieve that is by taking your time and incorporating the things that you like and that are important to you,\" she added.\n\nFor example, when it comes to artwork, she recommends building a collection over time and avoiding mass-produced pieces.",

    "description": "Afters years of talk, governments in Australia, France, and more are taking action to ban social-media for kids. Some warn of unintended effects.",
    "fullText": "After years of discussion, 2026 is shaping up to be the year when governments around the world take action on kids using social media.\n\nAustralia, France, Denmark, and Norway are advancing or planning social-media bans for young people under a certain age. In the US, a patchwork of state-based efforts is likely to face tougher prospects.\n\nThe changes come as concerns mount over the toll that platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat can take on young people's mental health.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, in a New Year's Eve speech, reiterated his support for banning social media for children and young teens — setting the tone for what could be a landmark year for such efforts worldwide.\n\n\"We will protect our children and teenagers from social media and screens,\" he said.\n\nWorld leaders have talked for years about restricting children's access to social media. Now, that talk is crystallizing into action. Australia became the first major nation to impose a social-media ban for children under 16. Its law took effect in December.\n\nMacron wants France to follow Australia's example. Bills in the works would restrict access for children under 15 starting next fall, timed to coincide with the start of the new academic year.\n\nThe Malaysian government has said it intends to implement a similar ban this year. Denmark is also planning a ban for children under 15, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced in October, warning that \"never before have so many children and young people suffered from anxiety and depression.\" Norway, too, is considering similar measures, though its prime minister acknowledged it would be a challenge to enforce.\n\nIn India, high court judges suggested in December that the country consider legislation modeled on Australia's approach.\n\nSocial media executives have criticized bans on their products, touting their own safeguards, questioning the feasibility of such measures, and warning of unintended consequences.\n\nAs for the Australian law, Google and Meta had both called for a delay in its implementation. They said the government should rely on an age-verification system, which had been under trial before the new law took effect.\n\n\"We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them,\" a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider last year in response to EU discussion on young people and social media.\n\nElon Musk, owner of X, criticized Australia's legislation, calling it \"a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\" TikTok expressed \"significant concerns\" with the legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, a nationwide effort in the US — the birthplace of the world's largest social media companies — faces an uphill battle.\n\nWhile lawmakers in Congress have floated proposals to restrict young people's access, none have passed. Instead, the push has largely shifted to the states, where a patchwork of age-verification rules, parental-consent laws, and time limits is advancing, often amid legal challenges.\n\nVirginia is set to impose a one-hour daily limit on social-media use for children under 16 unless parents opt out, a law that is scheduled to take effect this year but is already facing legal challenges. Nebraska recently passed legislation requiring parental consent for minors to open social-media accounts. Other states, including Utah and Florida, have advanced age-verification or parental-consent laws that have been delayed or blocked in court.\n\nSome states are targeting smartphones, rather than just social media, imposing \"bell-to-bell\" bans on cellphones at public schools.\n\nAttorneys general from 14 states sued TikTok in October, saying the app is addictive and profits from damaging the mental health of children. TikTok has disputed that its products harm kids, defending its own internal safeguards.\n\nWhile momentum is gathering for efforts to protect children from social media, some industry watchers have cautioned that such efforts aren't a magic fix and could have unexpected knock-on effects.\n\n\"While UNICEF welcomes the growing commitment to children's online safety, social media bans come with their own risks, and they may even backfire,\" UNICEF, the United Nations agency focused on children, said in a December statement, noting that some marginalized children rely on social media and that others may find workarounds or flock to darker corners of the internet.",

    "description": "St. Barthelemy, or St. Barts, is a French-speaking Caribbean island with beaches and high-end shops where billionaires like Jeff Bezos vacation.",
    "fullText": "Located in the French West Indies, the small island runs about 11 miles long and 2.5 miles wide.\n\nIt's typically warm and sunny most of the year, with temperatures often in the 70s, 80s, or low 90s, and peak tourist season starts in late fall and lasts through the spring.\n\nAs a French territory, the official language of St. Barts is French, though English is also widely spoken.\n\nThe exclusive-feeling island is home to more than a dozen beaches, where visitors can soak up the sun on smooth, sandy shores and in crystal-clear water.\n\n\"I always say if you want to have your toes in the sand and eat a croissant that feels like you're in Paris, St. Barts is the place for you,\" Elisabeth Brown, the membership director at the luxury concierge service Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider's Madeline Berg.\n\nSurrounded by shallow coral reefs, St. Barts has some top-tier snorkeling spots, such as Grand Cul-de-Sac — home to sea turtles and a range of tropical fish.\n\nLocal natural sights also include mountains and hills formed from volcanic eruptions. That said, there are no active volcanoes on St. Barts.\n\nJeff Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez Bezos, were photographed in St. Barts this week — and the Amazon founder has been spotted in St. Barts on multiple occasions over the years.\n\nNo matter the time of year, though, the island regularly welcomes the wealthy.\n\nCelebrities like Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, and Leonardo DiCaprio have visited in the past, and influential banking families, like the Rothschilds, have famously purchased property there.\n\nIn addition to Bezos' vessel, massive yachts owned by Playrix founder Dmitry Bukhman, Dallas Mavericks owner Miriam Adelson, and entertainment mogul David Geffen also parked in St. Barts during the recent holiday.\n\nWhile the yachts are primarily used for transportation to the island, they're also attractions in and of themselves, featuring amenities such as jacuzzis and movie theaters.\n\nTravelers without private yachts can still reach the island by flying into an airport on a larger Caribbean island, like San Juan. From there, they could take a ferry or private boat to St Barts.\n\nVisitors have several options for accommodations, ranging from villa rentals starting at over $900 a night to luxurious hotels for an even higher price.\n\nThe Eden Rock hotel is just one example. It overlooks St. Jean Bay — home to one of the most popular beaches on St. Barts — and is home to fine-dining restaurants and holistic spas.\n\nDuring holiday seasons like New Year's, a single-night stay at its largest villa can cost upward of €13,000, or about $15,200.\n\nThere's also the Rosewood Le Guanahani resort, located on a private peninsula that's home to two secluded beaches, giving travelers the ultimate getaway far from crowds.\n\nSuch privacy comes at a price, as even its most basic room can run guests thousands of dollars a night.\n\nWith billionaire travelers always on-site, the island's retail scene largely caters to shoppers who can drop thousands at any given moment.\n\nSome of the designer brands that have boutiques on St. Barts include Hermès, Cartier, Dior, and Louis Vuitton.\n\nThe island's also home to luxury retailers like Patek Phillipe, which sells one-of-a-kind timepieces you can't find anywhere else. Some retail for five, six, and even seven figures.\n\nA trip to St. Barts isn't all about relaxation, though. There are plenty of places to party and experience live music.\n\nOne of the most popular spots for this on the island is Nikki Beach, an upscale restaurant and beach club. In past years, big-name musicians like Kygo and Mariah Carey have even performed at its New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nIt's also a go-to for people looking to relax poolside with a drink in hand — though keep in mind that even just renting a lounge chair may cost you over $100.",

    "fullText": "Your smartphone's price might increase in 2026 — and you'll have AI to thank for that.\n\nAccording to a December 2025 report from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC), the manufacturing of Random Access Memory (RAM), used to store data in devices such as computers and phones, is being reallocated to support AI data centers, rather than being incorporated into phones and PCs.\n\nJust as your smartphone runs faster with more memory available, so do AI data centers. As more companies rely on AI tools, the importance of reliable processing power increases, leading to the increased usage of more RAM.\n\nIDC expects DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) supply growth to be below historical norms in 2026 at 16% year-on-year.\n\nAs the hunt for affordable RAM becomes increasingly challenging for smartphone manufacturers like Apple, Google, and Samsung, their costs are likely to rise, which could impact the prices they charge consumers.\n\n\"In the case of the upcoming memory crisis, this is something that will hit the market hard,\" IDC senior research director Nabila Popal told CNET in December. \"Those vendors will have almost no choice but to pass the increased cost to consumers.\"\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint also expects a slower year for all phone manufacturers. The firm projects global smartphone shipments to decrease 2.1% in 2026.\n\nThe firm's research suggests that the price for memory could increase 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as a device's memory can represent anywhere from 10% to 20% of the total bill of materials.\n\nLarger manufacturers with a broader range of products offered, in terms of price, should fare better than others, according to Counterpoint senior analyst Yang Wang, while lower-end markets will likely be hit the hardest.\n\n\"Apple and Samsung are best positioned to weather the next few quarters,\" Wang said. \"But it will be tough for others that don't have as much wiggle room to manage market share versus profit margins.\n\nEven still, Counterpoint predicts that average selling prices will increase by 6.9%. For people looking to buy the iPhone 17 Max base model, that could mean eventually paying closer to $1,281, up from the $1,199 price tag announced in 2025.",

Bernie Sanders, made it clear his administration intends to \"govern expansively and audaciously.\"\n\nHere are some key quotes from Mamdani's speech on his plan to reshape the city, which he said he would make affordable for all:\n\nThose hoping Mamdani might moderate his views upon taking office may have received a wake-up call in his New Year's Day speech.\n\nThe new mayor didn't shirk from his socialist identity upon taking office, vowing to draw the city together by replacing \"the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism.\"\n\nChants of \"tax the rich\" rang out as Sanders spoke.\n\nMamandi said he planned to ensure the wealthiest would have to share the power under his administration.\n\nMamdani's speech criticized corporations and the government alike, sometimes in the same breath.\n\nHe pledged to deliver \"abundance,\" a lightning-rod word on the political left associated with the movement and book by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, which critiques liberal policies that fail to yield results and promote growth.\n\nMamdani vowed to \"reform a long broken property tax system,\" to crack down on \"the bad landlords who mistreat their tenants,\" and to \"free small business owners from the shackles of bloated bureaucracy.\"\n\nHe also reiterated the hallmarks of his campaign promises that enamored so many of his voters, reiterating his vows to deliver universal childcare, freeze the rent, and make \"buses fast and free.\"\n\n\"For too long in our city, freedom has belonged only to those who can afford to buy it,\" Mamdani said. \"Our City Hall will change that.\"",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nRobin Roefs (Sunderland): I think he has arguably been the signing of the season. Unbelievable the way he keeps performing to that same level and standard. He kept Sunderland in it against Manchester City with three or four great saves. The way that he has been playing and that backline has been playing, I could have just put that whole backline in. They were excellent and I thought he epitomised that.\n\nTrai Hume (Sunderland): We talk about Granit Xhaka, we talk about Roefs and we have spoken about individuals like Dan Ballard and the like but I think Hume has been their best performer throughout the whole course of it. Nobody is really talking about it.\n\nJaka Bijol (Leeds): At Anfield, everyone would have expected Liverpool to really, really do a job on this team here and make sure that they were ready to go. Unfortunately, Leeds are flying high. They defended resolutely and rode their luck, there was a massive chance for Hugo Ekitike to score and he probably should have but Leeds are in a good vein of form and Bijol has been an unsung hero.\n\nNathan Collins (Brentford): The game against Spurs was poor and the abilities and the attacking threat was poor. It was a defensive unit for both but I thought Nathan Collins was arguably the best defender on the pitch. Brentford continue their opportunity to stay in the league and that is going to be based on how defensively solid they are.\n\nMartin Zubimendi (Arsenal): Arsenal signed Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke and all of these other players that people were looking at. Probably their best bit of business was getting Zubimendi in early doors. He dictates the play, he's chipping in with a few goals as well now but he's really important to the way that they conduct themselves.\n\nJames Garner (Everton): He has played right-back, left-back, centre midfield, right midfield, you name it. He will play anywhere that Everton ask him to play. He does a job, not only is he a solid pro and a good kid but he never complains. When he's on the bench he doesn't complain, when he's playing he doesn't demand contracts and wages and things of that nature. A goal and an assist for him obviously helped Everton get a wonderful 2-0 victory at Nottingham Forest and he was a huge part of that.\n\nJoelinton (Newcastle): Is there a more dominant midfielder in the Premier League? I'll wait. 6ft 4in, can run all over you, can fight with you but also can do what he did against Burnley and score a goal after two minutes that was worthy of winning any game.\n\nDavid Brooks (Bournemouth): Brooks was the best player on the pitch for me against Chelsea by a country mile. He scored but it was just the way he took Bournemouth up the pitch. There are a lot of eyes on Antoine Semenyo and that he is probably leaving but I just thought that Brooks was fantastic in the way that he carries the ball and he will be the person who carries Bournemouth, not only to safety but to whatever position they end up in this season, it will be on his shoulders.\n\nLeandro Trossard (Arsenal): It's amazing to think that they were going to let him go. There was talk at the start of the season that he was going to be the one to come under the PSR rules. For me, he could be Arsenal's unsung hero of the year. He's now solved that left-sided problem which was an area with Gabriel Martinelli, then they brought Noni Madueke in, they tried Eberechi Eze out there. He's the starting left-sided player, it's just a given. Another goal, an emphatic goal but his work-rate and energy for the team is what's most impressive for me.\n\nYoane Wissa (Newcastle): First goal in two games. He's had a tough start since he got in to Newcastle after being injured but as a spark, he has a willingness to work for his team and an infectious personality that makes everybody else run if he is running. He's always smiling so that's why he gets in the team.\n\nJarrod Bowen (West Ham): When people talk about Bruno Fernandes, the first thing they say is where would Manchester United be without him? Where would West Ham be without Jarrod Bowen over the past five years? Honestly, the guy just keeps performing, takes the brunt of it as the captain and the face of West Ham. He knows what comes with that and the pressures that come with that but he keeps delivering and performing. Another goal for him in the draw with Brighton. If West Ham are to be safe this season, they'll rely on him heavily.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): Unbelievable result. Everyone looking at Arsenal coming up against an Aston Villa team that is in form and flying and looking at it as if they were going to struggle due to Declan Rice being out an a few others. It felt like this was a moment where Arsenal could potentially struggle. They didn't, Arteta found a way to win. It wasn't as easy as the scoreline suggested when you look at the first half chances for Villa. However, it was a massive win and a massive statement, especially when you look at Man City dropping a couple of points away at high-flying Sunderland.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "fullText": "Fulham manager Marco Silva has called for a review of the rules around players needing treatment for head injuries, after his side conceded a goal when temporarily reduced to 10 men in their 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace.\n\nReferee Tony Harrington asked Jorge Cuenca to leave the pitch for treatment after the Fulham defender appeared to put his hands to his face after being caught by a stray arm of Palace's Justin Devenny.\n\nCuenca was unhappy with the referee's decision, but walked off the pitch before play restarted.\n\nOliver Glasner's side then took the lead through a header from Jean-Philippe Mateta just a few seconds later, while Cuenca was waiting on the touchline.\n\nPremier League rules were changed before the 2024-25 season and state that should a player need to leave the field for treatment on a suspected head injury, he must remain off for a minimum of 30 seconds after play has restarted.\n\n\"We conceded a goal when the game was completely under control, and I really believe that at that moment we should not have been playing with 10 men,\" said Silva.\n\n\"Football is to be played 11 against 11. We cannot be always calling the medical stuff when it's not necessary to do it.\n\n\"I told the official because it's happening too often. I think they should review that they should analyse that.\"",

    "fullText": "Strasbourg manager Liam Rosenior is the leading contender for the Chelsea job vacated by Enzo Maresca.\n\nFormer Leicester boss Maresca, 45, left his role as Chelsea head coach on Thursday amid internal tensions with the club's hierarchy and ownership.\n\nThe process to replace the Italian is under way, and it is understood Englishman Rosenior is the frontrunner, though sources have stressed other candidates are also under consideration.\n\nRosenior's current employers are owned by investment vehicle BlueCo - the consortium set up to purchase Chelsea in 2022.\n\nThe 41-year-old, who previously managed Hull, has significant backing internally at Chelsea and it is understood candidates to replace him at Strasbourg are being considered because of his possible departure.\n\nPorto's Francesco Farioli has also been mooted as a potential contender.\n\nBefore appointing Maresca in 2024, Chelsea interviewed Marseille manager Roberto de Zerbi, Ipswich counterpart Kieran McKenna, and Thomas Frank, who was then at Brentford but has since moved to Tottenham.\n\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola and Fulham's Marco Silva have also been linked with the role in the past, though it is unclear if they are now contenders.\n\nThe club will not change their style of play, so it is highly unlikely they would move for Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner.\n\nChelsea Under-21s head coach Calum McFarlane will lead the side for Sunday's match against Manchester City, and is on media duties for a news conference to preview the game on Friday.\n\nA social media post from goalkeeper Robert Sanchez indicated that Maresca's backroom team have also departed the club.",

    "fullText": "As the full-time whistle went at Anfield, a goalless draw against Leeds United prompted some boos from sections of the home support.\n\nIt was the first time Liverpool had drawn 0-0 under Arne Slot, and the first result of that scoreline in 117 matches in all competitions, since December 2023 against Manchester United.\n\nLiverpool had not lost and Slot's side had extended their unbeaten run to eight games. But after a largely dull display, it showed a fanbase sharing their frustrations.\n\nFar too often this season, Liverpool have been a tough football team to watch.\n\nIt is not an overstatement to say that the Anfield crowd has been spoiled over the past decade from the Jurgen Klopp era to Slot winning the title in his first year at the club.\n\nThe standards are immensely high and rightly so for a club of this magnitude, but against a Leeds side who got promoted to the Premier League last season, Liverpool looked one-dimensional and lacked the quality to break through the visitors and their 5-4-1 setup.\n\nBar Jeremie Frimpong, who had the pace to move past some of the Leeds players with ease but perhaps lacked that final delivery, there were few moments which got the fans off their seats.\n\nIt was hardly the start to the New Year that Liverpool, Slot or the Anfield faithful would have desired.\n\nOne BBC Sport reader summed up the feelings of the fanbase in our live text.\n\n\"Liverpool still look as though there's a piece missing,\" said Jan from Rye.\n\n\"Heavy metal football this is not - it's not even aluminium foil football.\"",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola questioned whether it was only a two-horse Premier League title race, but his Manchester City side can ill-afford many slip-ups in their quest to hunt down leaders Arsenal.\n\nMikel Arteta's Gunners have struck the latest blow in this cat and mouse chase, four points clear at the summit following City's frustrating goalless draw at Sunderland on Thursday night.\n\nCity dropped points as the temperature at the Stadium of Light almost hit freezing on the first day of 2026.\n\nAnd Arsenal will need to maintain their cool if they are to claim their first top-flight crown in over two decades.\n\nCity had 67% possession and 14 shots in the North East, but were unable to break down a stubborn Sunderland defence who claimed a well-earned point.\n\n\"Two different halves,\" said City captain Bernardo Silva after the game. \"In the first half we didn't play that well. We didn't control the counter as well as we should.\n\n\"We attacked a bit too quick - we didn't move them to find spaces. Second half we had a lot more chances and today was one of those days we couldn't finish them.\n\n\"We are not happy because we wanted better than this.\"\n\nAs goalless draws go, this was an thoroughly entertaining one with both teams having chances to claim all three points.\n\nThe home fans grew in confidence as the match wore on but City could not find the key to unlock the defence as Sunderland maintained their impressive unbeaten record at home this season.\n\n\"If you look at Sunderland's home record I think it's a point well-earned,\" former Manchester City defender Steph Houghton said on BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"They [City] will overall be disappointed because of the chances they created but if you look at the likes of Arsenal and Aston Villa, to go there and get a point, we are half way through the season, there is a long, long way to go.\"\n\nJust like Arsenal in November, City could not beat the Black Cats.\n\nAnd Sunderland boss Regis le Bris was understandably delighted by the result, saying: \"I'm enjoying [it]. I think we showed strong character against probably one of the best teams in Europe at the minute.\n\n\"It was important to defend well. I think we were bold because we tried to be aggressive and high up the pitch. I think we disturbed their routine, maybe their flow and it was really important.\n\n\"We created a few chances as well, so it was a good game.\"",
